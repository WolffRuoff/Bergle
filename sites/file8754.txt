								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are many life skills that are essential for survival in our world today. You may find yourself asking right about now what those life skills might be? Just take a minute to think. You probably came up with ideas such as knowing how to swim, or even riding a bike. But did you even think of the things that are more essential such as reading and writing? If not, writer Mike Hanski of the Huffington post might throw his hands up in frustration. The simple skills of reading and writing have the power to bring out who you truly are and what you might aspire to be one day. Overlooking these two skills and forgetting the impact they can have is detrimental. Reading and writing are the driving force in achieving one’s goals and dreams.</p>
<p>In the article “Want to Be a Better Writer? Read More”, Mike Hanski illustrates a scarcity of inspiration and motivation harming the youth of America. Children and many adults today simply do not see the importance in reading and how it can benefit their lives. Well, for starters, Hanski says, “…the more you read at school, the better your vocabulary and cognitive skills become” (Hanski, 2014 p.2). Aside from improving your vocabulary, Hanski also explains how reading can help you overcome stress, increase empathy and on top of that reading can infinitely expand your general view of this world! Reading books and stories not only allow you to travel to other places and other worlds, but they open up a gateway into your own world and imagination.</p>
<p>Now if you are reading this and still see no reason to “waste your time reading” Mike Hanski’s article was written just for you. In his article he does a fantastic job using positive words that hook his readers into thinking “hey I guess reading isn’t that bad after all”. Hanski opens up his article by saying, “Reading is fashionable. Again. It’s cool…” (Hanski, 2014 p.1).  His use of the words “fashionable” and “cool” is to prove that reading should be as popular today as using Facebook or watching TV. On the contrary, Hanski delivers the message that not reading or writing can result in unemployment and illiteracy. His persuasive language throughout the article, both positive and negative relay the importance of these two life skills that should never be overlooked.</p>
