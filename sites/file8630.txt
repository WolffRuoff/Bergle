								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="mceItemHidden">Technology and smart devices are coming to new places in a variety of forms. Moving forward, technology is increasingly becoming a part of our daily lives. More than we even know it. But what does this mean for our generation? The goal is simple. To better the lives of many, keep everyone connected and make lives hassle free. But the transformation is easier said than done. Education is among one of the biggest undergoing changes. Current students have more ways than ever to explore new ideas and solve problems. And the growth is not coming to an end any time soon.</span></p>
<p><span class="mceItemHidden">The world is moving at a rapid pace and it’s directly led by recent technological innovations. Some of the most significant improvements are those taking place inside the classroom. Most say Technology’s integration with education enhances a student’s learning experience. However, <span class="hiddenSpellError">unrelatedly</span>, many see it as overwhelming, more time-consuming and difficult to make the change. However, this can’t be agreed to by everyone. New programs are allowing students to complete assignments entirely on their wireless devices without the need to pick up a pencil. Many find this very intriguing. New sharing options let students send off their assignments to teachers with ease. In addition, technology helps students stay in contact over weekends and school breaks.</span></p>
<p><span class="mceItemHidden">Another major strength of technology in the classroom is research, which has become easier than ever. The wide range of sources available right at one’s fingertips <span class="hiddenSuggestion">provide</span> students with speed and accuracy. Many agree, however, there is also a large <span class="hiddenSuggestion">selection</span> of garbage and irrelevant inaccurate information and people need <span class="hiddenGrammarError">to be</span> aware of. Throughout the encyclopedia article, the idea that mobile learning is controversial repeatedly comes up. But why? While technology in the classroom may seem useful to the <span class="hiddenSuggestion">majority</span>, many see it as distracting. Others say it’s even more time-consuming than standard learning and can cause stress due to common system errors making productivity a challenge. Additionally, many see it as unreliable and <span class="hiddenGrammarError">an invasion of</span> privacy. Being a student myself, it’s sometimes hard to disagree. According to (&#8220;Technology integration,&#8221; 2015), another concern <span class="hiddenGrammarError">is cost</span>. With all that one gets with access to a mobile device, it can become costly when having to <span class="hiddenSuggestion">provide</span> devices for a whole class. It’s believed by many that technology for the classroom is a work in progress that’s constantly growing and expanding.</span></p>
<p><span class="mceItemHidden">One key benefit of technology’s integration in the classroom is interactive learning. According to (&#8220;Technology integration,&#8221; 2015), the thought process and conceptual experience makes for an easier learning process. But why? By learning from one’s mistakes, students can make changes, review and perfect assignments and thus learn by doing. So what? This method has been proven <span class="hiddenGrammarError">to be</span> one of the best ways for the brain to absorb information.</span></p>
<p><span class="mceItemHidden">Being able to work on projects simultaneously with one another submit to the teacher for review all though a handheld device is something people in the past have only dreamed about. This relates to the class reading on how technology has evolved over time. According to (&#8220;Technology integration,&#8221; 2015), a project-based activity can enhance one’s ability to work in groups and solve more complex problems that one couldn’t normally complete on their own. In addition, interactive learning can also be fun and enjoyable. So What? This keeps the mind flowing and ultimately keeps students focused for longer periods at a time. This <span class="hiddenGrammarError">can be</span> very noticeable. As a result of recent technological advancements, it’s clear that collaboration plays a major role in the learning process. </span></p>
<p><span class="mceItemHidden">Technology in the classroom has come a long way. With <span class="hiddenGrammarError">the addition of</span> new programs and services, the methods to learning have changed drastically. Despite high costs, privacy issues, distractions, and often less reliability, technology in the classroom is becoming increasingly common throughout school districts around the globe. In relation to class discussions, many agree that technology is always growing and the only thing that stands in the way of adoption is time and effort. <span class="hiddenSpellError">Infographics</span> in recent class assignments have shown us the numbers <span class="hiddenSuggestion">pertaining to</span> the increasing adoption of digital media. Major brands are hard at work attempting to bring the latest and greatest to everyone so that lives <span class="hiddenGrammarError">will</span> be made easier and education <span class="hiddenGrammarError">can be</span> improved for all. </span></p>
