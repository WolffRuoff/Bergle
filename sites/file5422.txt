								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey all! I thought it was about time we starting defining things. You&#8217;ll hear some of these terms in the play, so consider these additional or alternate definitions:</p>
<p>Intersectionality is the idea that all of our identities inform our life experience, and that the way they interact is unique for every person. As an example, I&#8217;m a white Jewish male. So my experience would be different than a white Christian male&#8217;s even though we are both white men. The same goes for any aspect of identity: sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, you name it.</p>
<p>Another really important thing to take away is the fact that these multiple identities might mean that you have power in some facets of your life, but don&#8217;t in others. Continuing with me as an example, I have a lot of social power because I&#8217;m white, but the fact that I&#8217;m Jewish means that I&#8217;m also part of a historically oppressed minority group, and I lack power because of that.</p>
<p>However, do not take this to mean that a black male&#8217;s experience is equal to a white female&#8217;s experience. It isn&#8217;t as easy and mathematical as that (trust me, I&#8217;m a math major).</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll continue to talk about it throughout the year, so this is merely a heads-up. See y&#8217;all soon!</p>
