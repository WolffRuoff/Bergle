Unused titles have been removed and others are now available online. You may have noticed the print collection has shrunk significantly. Likewise, the print Periodicals Collection continues to shrink as we transfer subscriptions to online versions. Rather than maintaining these two smaller collections separately, this summer we will be interfiling our three major collections: Reference, Periodicals, and the Main Collection of books. This means, for example, history reference books, history books, and history periodicals will be shelved together in one place in the library. The new combined Main Collection will have the same footprint as the 3 separate collections, spanning the 3 floors of the library.<\/p>\n<p>Although they will be interfiled with the circulating collection of books, Reference books and Periodicals will not circulate.\u00a0 Reference items will continue to be identified with \u201cRef.\u201d in front of the Call Number. Periodicals will be assigned a Call Number and will be identified with &#8220;Per.&#8221; in front of the Call Number.<\/p>\n<p>As we combine the three collections, we will be shifting their locations physically and updating \u00a0the library catalog. Some Reference Collection items have already been shifted to the Main Collection.
