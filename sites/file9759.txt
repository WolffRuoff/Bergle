			<p>When she traveled to Italy with the Muhlenberg women’s basketball team during the summer of 2010, Alexandra Chili fell in love with the culture and European way of life (especially the croissants and cappuccino).</p>
<p>Now, she wants to make another trek across the pond. But this time she hopes the trip will be primarily about business.</p>
<p>After completing one of the most accomplished careers in both Muhlenberg and Centennial Conference history, the two-time All-American was invited to the 2012 Women&#8217;s Final Four Combine held in late March in Denver.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/05/chilicombine.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1096" title="Alexandra Chili" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/05/chilicombine.jpg" alt="Alexandra Chili" width="250" height="482" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/05/chilicombine.jpg 250w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/05/chilicombine-155x300.jpg 155w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px" /></a>There, Chili took the next step in a journey she hopes will end in a place not normally associated with Division III athletes: professional basketball.</p>
<p>Chili was part of a group of about 80 players from all NCAA divisions, as well as former college players, who took part in a series of drills and games played in front of scouts from the WNBA and several European professional leagues.</p>
<p>And just like she had during her time in a Mule uniform, Chili stood out from the rest, thanks in large part to her lethal jump shot.</p>
<p>The school and conference career three-point leader for men or women, Chili knocked down 21 of her 25 attempts from beyond the arc, more than any other player at the combine. Then when teams were picked for the games, she found herself alongside players from conferences like the Big Ten and Pac 12.</p>
<p>And after taking a short while to get used to the thin air in the Mile High City, she felt that she more than held her own despite being one of just a handful of Division III players invited to the event.</p>
<p>“You could really notice the elevation difference,” she said. “But I feel like I played pretty well. I was a little nervous at first, but once we got going I didn’t really think about that.”</p>
<p>Chili played so well, in fact, that she’s already garnered interest from teams in Israel and Italy. Although there have not been any official offers yet, she received positive feedback from the combine’s director, who told her she had the ability to play professionally.</p>
<p>Now comes the hardest part for Chili, who made a habit of scoring points quickly: waiting. She’s done all she could to leave a positive lasting impression for the scouts, and as she gets ready for finals week, she’s anxiously hoping for the phone call that could come as early as today, or not until August or September.</p>
<p>But as she was during her entire career, Chili is prepared. After she dons her cap and gown and graduates in two-and-a-half weeks, she will continue working to improve her game. She has a summer job lined up in case she doesn’t hear back soon, but she’s also put her long-term plans temporarily on hold so she can chase her dream.</p>
<p>It’s not every day that an athlete is given the opportunity to make a living playing the sport they love. Then again, considering she’s the only player in conference history, male or female, to score 2,000 career points, Chili has shown she’s not like every other player.</p>
<p>Now she’s ready for the opportunity to take her game to the next level. All that she needs is a call.</p>
<p>“I had never really thought about playing professionally until this season,” she said. “But when I looked into it, I thought it might be pretty cool. It would be a great to get to live in Europe and experience the culture. I’ll probably never have a chance like this again, so I want to make the most of it.”</p>
<p>“Hopefully I’ll get a call soon; between that and graduation, it would really be time to celebrate.”</p>

			<p><em><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/Special-Olympics.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-968" title="Special Olympics - Division III" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/Special-Olympics.jpg" alt="" width="220" height="238" /></a>NCAA Division III is engaged in a partnership with Special Olympics this year. According to the NCAA Website, the purpose of the partnership is to improve the lives of Special Olympics athletes through their involvement with Division III student-athletes and to foster a mutual learning experience between Division III student-athletes and Special Olympics athletes.</em></p>
<p><em>Last month, we had an <a title="A “Special” Saturday" href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/2012/03/20/a-special-saturday/">article </a>on four Muhlenberg athletes participating in a Special Olympics bowling event. Recently, the Mule basketball teams got to help out at a Special Olympics practice session. Junior Kate Clawson (who also participated in the bowling event) and sophomore Leeann Lanza wrote the following reports:</em></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Kate Clawson</span></p>
<p>I was so excited to go to the Special Olympics basketball practice because I knew there would be many familiar faces, having just gone to a bowling event a few weeks prior. But I was just as excited to meet new athletes.</p>
<p>Just as I had expected, one of the friends I made there, Tarre, was super excited to see me and catch up. All of the other athletes were so happy to have us there, and you could tell on all of our faces that we were more than happy to be there too. We started off by stretching with them, then split the group into four lines and had relay races with dribbling. This was really fun for everyone because some of the Muhlenberg athletes also got to participate.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/SO_basketball1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1079" title="Special Olympics basketball" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/SO_basketball1.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="160" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/SO_basketball1.jpg 500w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/SO_basketball1-300x96.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>Next we split up into stations, for dribbling, passing, shooting and games. My group, which included junior Hunter Forsman and freshman AJ Dean, did passing. It was funny because some of the athletes thought passing was too easy, because some are very skilled, but we explained to them that even college athletes warm up and practice our passing.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/SO_basketball2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1080" title="Special Olympics basketball" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/SO_basketball2.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="207" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/SO_basketball2.jpg 500w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/SO_basketball2-300x124.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>Each group had so much fun, and the shooting group with the enthusiastic Austin Curry and Ryan Lagomarsino was definitely the loudest. It was great seeing all the athletes and teammates having fun together.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/SO_basketball3.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1081" title="Special Olympics basketball" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/SO_basketball3.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="364" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/SO_basketball3.jpg 250w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/SO_basketball3-206x300.jpg 206w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px" /></a>We continued this by playing 3v3 games. This was my favorite part because I got to see the athletes really in their element. Their effort, teamwork and enthusiasm were so tremendous to see. Each time one of the athletes scored, the biggest smile came across their face, and high fives were a must. I loved watching my teammate Caitlyn excel. It seemed like she couldn’t miss!</p>
<p>At the end we huddled together in the middle, and just like after a practice at Muhlenberg, said MULES! on the count of 3. I think it was important to bring everyone together and have that sense of community, because not only did the Special Olympics athlete learn things from us that night, but we also learned about the heart, joy and courage that the Special Olympics athletes take pride in.</p>
<p>Hopefully we will be a part of this experience a few more times before the semester ends!</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Leeann Lanza</span></p>
<p>Our trip to help out with the Lehigh Valley Special Olympics team at Trexler Elementary School was one I will never forget. As soon as we arrived, we were greeted with excitement and enthusiasm by a few players who just could not wait to start playing. Both the men’s and women’s Muhlenberg basketball teams were there and ready to share everything we know about the game with players of all ages.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/SO_basketball4.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1082" title="Special Olympics basketball" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/SO_basketball4.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="221" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/SO_basketball4.jpg 500w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/SO_basketball4-300x132.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>When we split into different stations, a few of my teammates and I, along with some of the men, taught the players some tricks about defense. Getting to help different groups of the players with defense and rebounding was so much fun because it turned into a one-on-one competition between all of us!</p>
<p>After our first practice with players of all ages, I had the opportunity to stay with our men’s team and scrimmage with the Special Olympics competitive men’s team (who will play in a tournament at Kutztown for the regional championship in May). This was a really fun experience for me getting to hang out with our men’s team and also getting to make some new friends. The Special Olympics organization allows these players to participate in high levels of competition while still conveying the importance of having FUN with the game!</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/SO_basketball5.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1083" title="Special Olympics basketball" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/SO_basketball5.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="285" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/SO_basketball5.jpg 400w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/SO_basketball5-300x213.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></a>I know that I speak for all of the Mules who got the opportunity to take part in this practice when I say that we really enjoyed ourselves and learned a lot from this experience. I think a new appreciation for basketball can be gained when playing with or even just watching some of these players. Their spirit and positive attitudes are just the motivation we need to get excited for our own season next winter. Hopefully we will all be able to get together again soon so we can cheer each other on!</p>

			<p><em>Here are excerpts from the senior profiles that ran in the Senior Day program for the women&#8217;s basketball team.</em></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/11/chilihs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-530" title="Alexandra Chili" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/11/chilihs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Alexandra Chili</strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s it mean to you to be the leading scorer in Mule basketball history? </strong>Becoming the leading scorer in Mule basketball history has been a tremendous honor and certainly one of my favorite achievements of my college career. I’ve worked tirelessly throughout my four years to be the best player I could be, but my efforts would be wasted if I was not blessed with such amazing teammates.</p>
<p><strong>How did you become such a great shooter? </strong>I developed my shooting prowess like any other great shooter; hard work, persistence, repetition, dedication and some more hard work. When I was growing up, I would shoot 1,000 shots a day and wouldn’t rest until I had made 100 free throws. I’m not sure I can claim the same today, but that’s why you put in the work early!</p>
<p><strong>What’s it like having a father that played at Duke? </strong>Having a father like mine, regardless of whether he played at Duke, has been such a blessing. My Dad has always been there for me as a coach, rebounder, my biggest fan (tied with my mother, whom I love dearly) and anything I’ve needed to be successful. Being a star at Duke does have its perks though. We usually go to a game at Cameron Indoor Stadium once a year, and he seems to know everyone there! I’ve even met Coach K. That was beyond cool!</p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans? </strong>I’m hoping to play basketball professionally in Europe somewhere for a year since I was never able to study abroad. I really love to travel, and I think it will be a good experience for me to be out on my own for a little while. When I return to United States, I will seek admission to law school in either Maryland or California and begin my path towards becoming a lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>What’s Katy Rossino like off the court? </strong>Wow, where to begin. When Katy is not collecting chapstick, she is meticulously grooming her financial savings. When she’s not doing that, she’s pulling a prank on someone; so watch out … Jokes aside, Katy is just as amazing off the court as she is on it. Brilliant, hardworking and my best friend.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/muihs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-980" title="Kimberly Mui" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/muihs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Kimberly Mui</strong></p>
<p><strong>How great did it feel to be able to step back on the court this season? </strong>When I tore my ACL last summer, the hardest thing to comprehend was the fact that I would not be able to be on the court and play with my friends that season. Being able to step back on the court this season was an incredible and indescribable feeling. I have a great passion for basketball, so stepping back on the court with my teammates was amazing, and I’m lucky to have had a successful surgery to be able to play again in my senior year.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s the key to playing tough defense?</strong> Defense has always been my main focus in basketball. I’m a true believer in the saying “Defense wins championships.” I also believe that with good defense comes good offense. I think one of the keys to playing tough defense is to always keep your feet moving and stay lower than your opponent. Being fast and quick also doesn’t hurt 🙂</p>
<p><strong>How many different ways have you heard your name mispronounced? </strong>Over my life, I’ve heard ridiculous mispronunciations of my name. It spans from Moo, Moo-i, Moo-ey, Mwee, to My. I think my favorite is Moo-ey because a lot of people call me that and yell out that name. Also, Moo-ey seems to flow off the tongue. Mew is a funny one too because my freshman year, all the senior basketball players used to call me “Kim Mew for Two.”</p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans? </strong>I’m not exactly sure yet because I still have to send my resume to companies and go on interviews, but I would love to work at a marketing firm somewhere in New York. My dream is to work in the sports industry, like being on the marketing team for the New York Yankees.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s Kathleen Naddaff like off the court? </strong>Kathleen is probably the weirdest person you will ever meet. After living with her this year, I realized that she likes to make weird noises and scream randomly. All kidding aside, Kathleen is one of the most genuine and sweetest people I know. She would do anything for her family, friends and teammates, and that is one of the many things I admire about her. <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/12/naddaffhs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-628" title="Kathleen Naddaff" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/12/naddaffhs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Kathleen Naddaff</strong></p>
<p><strong>How would you describe your style of play? </strong>I am definitely a lot more defensive-minded when it comes to my style of play, and I know my role on the team is not to be a leading scorer, but to help the team win with rebounding, boxing out, screening and playing defense. I definitely would say I play to try and make the team better, and I don’t worry about my stats. <em></em></p>
<p><strong>How have you improved since your freshman season? </strong>During my freshman year I was nervous, scared and very hesitant. I looked at all of the teams and thought they were much more experienced than I was, so that intimidated me. I can remember the first game of the Scotty Wood Tournament my freshman year, I literally thought I was going to throw up I was so nervous. Now I go out on the floor with the mindset that no one can guard me or get by me if I tell myself they won’t. I have prided myself on my defense, and if I just concentrate on that and get a few great stops, my offense will come. I am a lot more confident walking out on the court because I have done it many times before.</p>
<p><strong>What’s it like having a father that was drafted by the Indiana Pacers?</strong> I am so proud of my dad, and I look up to him a lot. He and my mom have been such amazing role models in my life. Yes, my father’s shoes are very hard to fill (quite literally), but I know that he has been through a lot and knows the game of basketball. So I really do look up to him and respect everything he has to say.</p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans? </strong>I actually have two job offers right now, with a few more interviews lined up. The job offers are at BE Furniture and BFI Furniture. They are corporate furniture companies in Parsippany, N.J., where I would function as a project manager. I am looking to stay close so I can live at home for a few more years. Mom and Dad are going to love it 🙂<em></em></p>
<p><strong>What kind of teammate is Kimberly Mui? </strong>Kim is not only an amazing teammate, but she is also one of my roommates. Kim really makes me want to be a better teammate, because regardless of what happens, she is there for this team with a smile and encouraging words. I seriously give her all the credit in the world for what she went through last year and how supportive she was throughout the entire year for the team. Kim will cheer every single girl on, and she honestly is not just an amazing teammate but also a great friend.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/rossinohs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-981" title="Katy Rossino" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/rossinohs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Katy Rossino</strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s it feel like knowing you’re in control of the offense as a point guard? </strong>I love being a point guard. There was a time at the beginning of the season when I was nervous about it. To know that I was in control of the offense was a scary thing for me, especially since I hadn’t had that opportunity to see significant minutes since high school. I’ve become a much more vocal player, and have learned so much about each player on our team – where to get them the ball, how they are going to come off a screen, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Have you always been so hesitant to shoot? </strong>I’ve never been one to take 20 shots in a game, but I did shoot more in high school. I’ve always tried to do what I need to help the team. My role has always been to be more of a passer, a provider of comedic relief and, most importantly, a role model to the younger girls. They really look up to me as a mature, inspirational and “larger than life” figure.</p>
<p><strong>What off-the-court accomplishment are you most proud of? </strong>I’m very proud of my work with the Academic Resource Center. I’ve been a tutor all four years at Muhlenberg and have tutored about 25 students in math, finance and accounting classes. I enjoy tutoring because it is an extremely rewarding experience. It’s always great to know that I helped someone succeed in a class. I’ve learned a lot about how to adjust to different learning styles, which is a skill I have been able to use at various financal and accounting internships and plan to use in the future when I start working.</p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans? </strong>Next October I will begin working as an auditor at Deloitte &amp; Touche, a big four public accounting firm, in Boston. I’ll spend the summer studying for the CPA exam and hope to pass all four sections by my start date. Then I hope to transition into my dream job, which is winning the lottery and moving to Europe, where my only responsibilities will be eating and sleeping. <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What kind of person is Alexandra Chili? </strong>Where do I begin? Chili has been my best friend at Muhlenberg since we were freshmen. We spend way too much time together playing basketball, becoming the dominating duo in team ping-pong tournaments, saying “Hey, what’s up” to all the wrong people, and everything in between. She has an extraordinary personality and can make anyone laugh to the point of tears. Sometimes we laugh so much we cry, and then the next morning we have no idea what we laughed about. She’s an unbelievable basketball player, student and friend. I’ve already promised her that I’ll name my first child “Alexander Chilington,” which has been my nickname for her.</p>

			<p><em><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/Special-Olympics.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-968" title="Special Olympics - Division III" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/Special-Olympics.jpg" alt="" width="220" height="238" /></a>NCAA Division III is engaged in a partnership with Special Olympics this year. According to the NCAA Website, the purpose of the partnership is to improve the lives of Special Olympics athletes through their involvement with Division III student-athletes and to foster a mutual learning experience between Division III student-athletes and Special Olympics athletes.</em></p>
<p><em>On Saturday, four Mule athletes representing four sports (field hockey, volleyball, basketball and softball) and field hockey coach Megan Eddinger paticipated in a Special Olympics event. Junior Devon Barber filed this report:</em></p>
<p>Most people would argue that beautiful Saturdays aren’t meant to be spent inside &#8211; except the members of the Student-Athlete Advisory Committee who spent a great St. Patrick’s Day afternoon at Jordan Lanes for the Special Olympics Lehigh County Bowling Event.</p>
<p>Coach Eddinger, Brittany Blohm, Kate Clawson, Erica Wenzel and I all hopped in a mini-van behind Martin Luther Saturday morning to head over to the alley. After a much-needed stop at Dunkin Donuts, we arrived to find that we missed a memo. We were all dressed in <a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/SpecialOlympics3.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-969" title="Special Olympics" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/SpecialOlympics3.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="245" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/SpecialOlympics3.jpg 350w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/SpecialOlympics3-300x210.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" /></a>Muhlenberg t-shirts, but many of the athletes were dressed in St. Patrick’s Day attire. One of the staff members even had a green beard! Still, we were welcomed with open arms by the staff, athletes and the local Girl Scouts who were helping out as well.</p>
<p>The staff seemed stressed from the beginning and we were a bit nervous. The reason behind this tension was because there were 96 bowlers that we had to keep track of! Bowlers were either playing individually against other bowlers in the same lane, or there were two teams that were competing against each other in opposing lanes. It was handled pretty smoothly, though, as the competition started at 1:00 on the dot.</p>
<p>The national anthem was played after the reciting of the Special Olympics Oath:</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Let me win, but if I cannot win, let me be brave in the attempt.”</strong></p>
<p>It was pretty powerful to hear all of the athletes say this oath before they began bowling. It represented a lot of what Special Olympics Lehigh County is about, where their philosophy asserts the athletic spirit of courage and joy, as well as giving those with disabilities the opportunity to share their skills and friendship with the community as a whole. Special Olympics Lehigh County provides year-round sports competitions, such as for basketball, gymnastics, track and field and more, for adults and children of a variety of ages. For this event specifically, the bowling winners had the chance to advance to different competitions, so it was safe to say that the contest was fierce from the get-go.</p>
<p>Coach and Kate were assigned to keep score for the lanes that had a battle between two teams. Erica, Brittany and I were placed on reward duty, so we got the chance to sit back and watch a couple games before we had to turn on our math brains to add up the scores.</p>
<p>The bowlers were allowed to practice a bit before the scoring started. We were a little confused to see how even though they were on different teams, they switched back and forth to each other’s lanes between turns. I could see Coach starting to get uncomfortable because we all didn’t really know what was going on. Coach asked one of the bowlers, Christina, to explain the switching of lanes. She claimed that this is what they have been doing for weeks, so they knew that what they were doing was correct.</p>
<p>Christina went on to explain how the bowling event that we attended was actually the end of an eight-week series, where bowlers competed every weekend since sometime in January. Bowlers that were at this event were allowed to compete to move onto the next competition if they were present at at least five of the eight weekend events. With this being said, the athletes took control, and quickly moved from the practice round onto their competing games.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/SpecialOlympics4.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-970" title="Special Olympics" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/SpecialOlympics4.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="264" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/SpecialOlympics4.jpg 400w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/SpecialOlympics4-300x198.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></a>It was fun to walk back and forth between games to see how well they were doing. One of the bowlers, David, was angry about one of his scores, 130-something mind you, which is way higher than I would ever get personally. I told him I celebrate when I break 100 and he laughed at me.</p>
<p>It was certain that these athletes were in it to win it, although the more serious bowlers were also balanced with those who were there just to have a good time. It showed because they were the ones that were making jokes with us and taking pictures with us. <a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/SpecialOlympics2.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-971" title="Special Olympics" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/SpecialOlympics2.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/SpecialOlympics2.jpg 400w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/SpecialOlympics2-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></a>Kate especially looked like she was having a great time, as she was surrounded by two teams of all happy-go-lucky bowlers. All in all, it was fun to take photos, laugh, and just watch and learn as they racked up impressive scores.</p>
<p>At the end, Erica, Brittany and I were in charge of adding up the scores and distributing the ribbons. I think Erica would agree when I write thank goodness for calculators! The scores were added and a ribbon was presented to each bowler representing first, second, third or fourth place, with their names and individual scores written on the back.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/SpecialOlympics1.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-972" title="Special Olympics" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/SpecialOlympics1.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/SpecialOlympics1.jpg 400w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/SpecialOlympics1-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></a>It was an amazing feeling to see how excited they were to receive their ribbons from Brittany for any place that they got. It really allowed me to think back about why I started playing sports in the first place: for the happiness I feel because of it.</p>
<p>Kate Clawson said, “Overall, the experience at the Special Olympics bowling event this Saturday was very rewarding. Interacting with the athletes was awesome. They were all such great sports and that’s something I really admired about them, as they admired us for volunteering our time.”</p>
<p>I think generally we were just happy to interact with each other, especially on such a fun holiday and a beautiful day. It was something that I’ll always remember, and wouldn’t hesitate to do it again.</p>

			<p>If it seemed like the 2011-12 season was a particularly good one for basketball at Muhlenberg, that&#8217;s because it was.</p>
<p>The Mule women ended their season in the second round of the NCAA Tournament at Mount Union on Saturday, bringing down the curtain on one of the best winters of basketball in College history.</p>
<p>The women finished with a record of 23-6, while the men were 18-9. The 41 combined wins were the second-most ever at Muhlenberg. Here are the top 10 years for combined wins:</p>
<ul>
<li>2008-09    42-15 (women 26-4, men 16-11)</li>
<li><strong>2011-12    41-15 (women 23-6, men 18-9)</strong></li>
<li>2001-02    40-10 (women 21-4, men 19-6)</li>
<li>2005-06    40-15 (women 26-3, men 14-12)</li>
<li>1985-86    36-15 (men 20-7, women 16-8)</li>
<li>2010-11    36-18 (women 23-6, men 13-12)</li>
<li>1997-98    35-20 (women 18-10, men 17-10)</li>
<li>2009-10    34-20 (women 21-6, men 13-14)</li>
<li>1998-99    33-18 (men 17-8, women 16-10)</li>
<li>1996-97    33-18 (women 18-8, men 15-10)</li>
</ul>
<p>During the season both Mule teams won two tournaments, one at home (the Scotty Wood Tournament) and one on the road (the Gallaudet Holiday Tournament for the men, the Centennial Conference playoffs for the women).</p>
<p>The men came within one win of the CC title. It was the eighth time in the 19-year history of the league that a school placed both its men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s team in the championship game, and the first time since 2000 that a school did so and came away with one title:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>2012 Muhlenberg (women won, men lost)</strong></li>
<li>2008 Gettysburg (both lost)</li>
<li>2006 Johns Hopkins (both lost)</li>
<li>2004 Johns Hopkins (both lost)</li>
<li>2000 Johns Hopkins (women won, men lost)</li>
<li>1999 Johns Hopkins (both won)</li>
<li>1998 Muhlenberg (both won)</li>
<li>1998 Johns Hopkins (both lost)</li>
</ul>
<p>Both Mule teams wound up exactly where they were predicted to in the CC preseason polls (the women first and the men second). But to say the seasons went as expected would be a stretch. Both teams started strong (a combined 17-2 in November and December), faltered in January (a combined 9-9) and hit their strides coming down the stretch (a combined 11-2 in February leading up to the playoffs).</p>
<p>In January, before the teams hit their rough patch, we wrote about the <a title="Win-Win Proposition" href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/2012/01/11/win-win-proposition/">success of both teams</a>. The article referred to an &#8220;infectious culture of winning.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now that the infection has taken hold, the Mules and their fans hope it continues to spread in the coming years.</p>

<p>Following the Mules&#8217; NCAA Tournament second-round loss to Mount Union, Purple Raider football coach Larry Kehres came to Muhlenberg coach Ron Rohn and said, &#8220;I&#8217;d take your number 12 on my football team any day!&#8221; The endorsement of one of the most successful coaches in college football history helps Chili earn athlete of the week. So do averaging 18.0 points, 10.5 rebounds and 3.0 assists in two NCAA Tournament games and becoming the first Centennial Conference basketball player to score 2,000 points.</p>

<p>Vila hit .500 with four RBI as Muhlenberg won two of its first three games in Florida. He had an .833 slugging average and a .600 on-base percentage. Vila hit a game-tying three-run homer in the Mules&#8217; 10-9 win against Wheaton (Ill.) and singled in the middle of a two-run eighth-inning rally that led to a 4-3 defeat of Ohio Northern.</p>

<p>The Mules peaked at the right time, beating Franklin &amp; Marshall and Johns Hopkins to capture their record seventh Centennial Conference championship (no other program has more than four). It’s the second straight year Muhlenberg avenged a pair of regular-season loses by beating Hopkins in the title game on its home court. The Mules have won five of the last seven CC titles and are the first team in any sport in school history to advance to five straight NCAA Tournaments.</p>

<p>Rice went 4-for-4 at the Centennial Conference Indoor Championships to pick up his third straight Most Outstanding Performer Award for track events (2 indoor, 1 outdoor). He ran the anchor leg on the 4&#215;200-meter relay team that broke the school and conference championship meet records and set another meet mark in the 400. Rice missed the championship record by .01 seconds to win the 200 and closed out his perfect day with a gold in the 4&#215;400-meter relay. His 16 career gold medals are the most in school history.</p>

			<p>When she looked up, Alexandra Chili admitted she got a little scared.</p>
<p>She had just knocked down a pair of free throws in the closing seconds of the Muhlenberg women’s basketball team’s Centennial Conference Championship win at Johns Hopkins. But the game had been all but decided for several minutes, so she had no idea why her teammates were charging at her.</p>
<div id="attachment_868" style="width: 378px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/02/chilicelebration.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-868" class="size-full wp-image-868" title="chilicelebration" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/02/chilicelebration.jpg" alt="" width="368" height="360" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/02/chilicelebration.jpg 368w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/02/chilicelebration-300x293.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/02/chilicelebration-306x300.jpg 306w" sizes="(max-width: 368px) 100vw, 368px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-868" class="wp-caption-text">The Mules and Coach Ron Rohn celebrate with Chili</p></div>
<p>When they picked her up, the announcement came over the P.A. system: Those foul shots, the 339<sup>th</sup> and 340<sup>th</sup> of her career, pushed her all-time point total to 1,966, the most in conference women’s history.</p>
<p>“I was really confused,” Chili said. “I didn’t know I was that close, so I had no idea what everyone was doing.</p>
<p>“I’m just glad they didn’t drop me like they did last year,” she added with a laugh, referencing the celebration after her game-winning 3-pointer against Williams in the 2011 NCAA Tournament.</p>
<p>Her 28-point effort was just enough to surpass the previous mark of 1,965 set by Swarthmore’s Heather Kile from 1999-02. She is just seven points shy of the conference record for men or women (1,973) held by Dennis Stanton from 2001-04 and 34 away from 2,000.</p>
<p>It’s just the latest of countless milestones for Chili, who also holds the conference mark with 328 career threes (ninth in Division III history) and the school records for career field goals (649) and the top four single-season scoring and 3-point marks.</p>
<p>But for all of her accolades, including second-team Academic All-America honors this season and honorable mention All-America laurels last year, Chili said none of the <a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/02/chilirecord2.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-876" title="chilirecord" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/02/chilirecord2.jpg" alt="" width="267" height="461" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/02/chilirecord2.jpg 267w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/02/chilirecord2-173x300.jpg 173w" sizes="(max-width: 267px) 100vw, 267px" /></a>accomplishments ever came close to crossing her mind when she first stepped on campus three-and-a-half years ago.</p>
<p>Following an illustrious, yet somewhat frustrating, high school career in which she scored more than 2,000 points on a team that hovered around .500 most seasons, she was drawn to the Mules’ success.</p>
<p>She wanted to play for a winning program and had her sights set on team, rather than personal, goals.</p>
<p>“I never could have dreamed this when I was a freshman,” Chili said. “My goal was to just do whatever it took to help the team win. I’ve played with a lot of great players who have helped me during my career. This is not just about me; the record would not have been possible without so many great coaches and teammates.”</p>
<p>As she had hoped, all of her individual accomplishments have come hand-in-hand with team successes. Chili is part of a senior class that tied the school record with 92 career wins. The Mules have played in the CC title game in each of her four seasons, winning three, and advanced to the NCAA Tournament each year.</p>
<p>There have also been two trips to the “Sweet 16,” which she still rates as the two most memorable moments of her career. And she hopes there’s still a chance for one more run.</p>
<p>And that’s what has served as her motivation during her career. While spending countless hours in the gym taking thousands upon thousands of shots, Chili was not focused on numbers or records. All she could think about, she said, was winning, and more importantly, how much she can’t stand losing.</p>
<p>For as mild-mannered as she is away from basketball, Chili morphs into an ultra-competitor as soon as steps onto the court. And it’s that drive that has made her one of the greatest players in CC history, but more importantly, helped the Mules establish a tradition of excellence.</p>
<p>“It’s a great honor to break the record; there have been a lot of great players that have played in this conference,” she said. “But I’m even more proud of our team and how we came together to win the championship.</p>
<p>“I’m sure when I look back on my career the record will mean a lot more. But right now, I’m just worried about trying to keep on winning. I want to play at least a few more games.”</p>
