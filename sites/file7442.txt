								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Social media has impacted almost all aspects of our lives in one way or another. It changes the way people receive news, travel places, make purchases, communicate, the list goes on and on. Today I am going to focus on social medias impact on businesses. After reading pages 1-25 of Brand Buzz in the Echoverse by K. Hewett, W. Rand, R. Rust and H. Heerde, I have a much deeper knowledge on this topic. Businesses are now realizing that they must take advantage of all of their possible communication tools and a big one, especially in this generation is social media.  Through social media, much can be accomplished and in much faster, precise ways. Social media is a platform that allows a single individual or company to reach millions in seconds by blogging or tweeting  and whatnot. When businesses have news to share or prices to reveal, social media is the ideal place for them to post about it and have it reach millions of possible customers. Almost everyday as I go through my twitter feed,  I will find advertisements for the &#8220;hottest new cloths&#8221; or &#8220;the best deal around&#8221;. These companies are using twitter as  a place to advertise that was not available before. Social media is also important for businesses when it comes to damage control. Bad news travels fast and sometimes it can spell the end of a businesses success. One way that companies are able to contain bad news or in most cases cut their losses is to stay on top of it on social media. Company tweets have been proven to improve bad situations, the more tweets posted by them, results in less negative tweets by other people. Twitter can be so effective in this way as a result of the changing way people receive their news. Social media is a growing factor in the news industry and it has become increasingly clear that people are going through sites like Twitter to find news and information that they would have normally found elsewhere. Compared to the radio, televisions, newspaper and others, social media is faster, more personalized and more accessible. Not all social media sites are equivalent when referring to businesses needs. Twitter has been found to contain more of the information and news sharing as apposed to Facebook which is more personal information and communication. Social media has changed the way businesses operate in many ways, it can help companies with advertisement to crowd control and that will help any business succeed.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The motives found for posting on Instagram are surveillance/knowledge about others, documentation, and coolness. According to &#8220;Instagram: Motives for its use and relationship to narcissism and contextual age&#8221;, of the motives “Surveillance/Knowledge about others” was the most influential reason behind Instagram use&#8221; (Sheldon and Bryant). I myself use Instagram often for knowledge about others and have noticed that my peers also do. I catch myself scrolling aimlessly just to keep updated and see what&#8217;s up with the people I follow on my account. Or I can even keep up with strangers that are not private and I go to the explore page. I can see what they are doing/have done.</p>
<p>The knowledge about others also included the following and &#8220;liking&#8221; of people&#8217;s posts. Several facts about someone can be figured out through their Instagram. This information ranges from someones economic status, relationship status, the amount of friends they have, and along with that who their closest friends are, etc. My friends and I all post a lot on Instagram and a lot about us can be discovered due to what we post. This information is only viewed by our followers, but if someone is not private, anyone can follow them or just view their posts without following them. that means complete strangers form the other side of the world can see what they have been doing in their life.</p>
<p>The next motive was &#8220;Documentation&#8221;. The authors write, &#8220;The reasoning behind Documentation surfacing as a potential motive in this study is likely due to the characteristics of Instagram that set it apart from other social media forums. For instance, Instagram primarily focuses on images or pictures whereas Twitter is a more text-based forum&#8221; (Sheldon and Bryant). People like to document their lives through photos, which makes it more likely for them to post a photo to Instagram rather than composing a tweet. Another good point mentioned in this article is that &#8220;Instagram allows users to provide both a picture and text as there is an option to provide a caption underneath the image. In this way, Instagram acts as a kind of virtual photo album for many people&#8221; (Sheldon and Bryant).</p>
<p>Lastly, there is &#8220;Coolness&#8221;. When it comes to social media people usually want to be on one that is popular among their peers. There are also &#8220;cool&#8221; features on Instagram like filters, links to things that are trending, and ways to explore. Along with these cool features people like to use this social media because of self-promotion and to become more popular. Everyone wants to get a lot of &#8220;likes&#8221; on their photos to show that they are cool and popular.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While I sat and listened to Jim Groom talk for a total of an hour and 15 minutes, I learned more about the internet and social media sites than I have ever thought I could. So many interesting topics and facts were discussed that it really makes me want to dig deeper on my own to try to understand a little bit better about the web as a whole and how everything works. One very interesting topic we talked about was how the internet and social media sites view us, the user. Most people would answer this as we are humans, easy, but that is not exactly the case. Everything we do on the internet is tracked and stored, the things we posed are used and we are practically working for free. To sites like Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and Twitter, we are merely the product. People use these sites to see what we, as in each other, post, tweet and etc. These sites are using what we do and selling it to people. Come to twitter and see what all your friends are posting, re tweeting and be apart of it all, as you can see, we are what they are selling and we should realize that we are working for free. If you are not happy with being a product, how does being a point of data feel. That is right, many social media sites see us humans as points of data, they collect all the things you do and charting them to see what people are doing, using and what they want. They do not stop and ask you before they do this, they just figure as Jim Broom talked about, the free part of the sites is having no privacy. Once they chart your data they will move to another and keep tallying up their statistics to see what is good for the social media site as a whole. It is said to say, however you are no longer human, you are a product or a point of data.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are constantly being watched on the internet. There is no privacy, no matter how tight we think the security on our social media pages are. The notion of social media sites being ‘free,’ is a scam, because although they may not take our money, they take our privacy. These sites, such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Gmail all advertise the fact that users can sign up and use their services for no cost; that ‘cost’ meaning money. The real cost of using these free sites is that they have access to view everything we do while using their product. These services will track what we search, and use it as a way to advertise products to us, knowing that we will be interested in the advertisements because of our internet search history. For example, if I were to purchase clothes online, the items that I view online would appear as advertisements on my Facebook news feed; I do not think that is such a coincidence. Jim Groom helped dissect the messages that we see every day in media. He explained the concept of DOOM (Domain of One’s Own), and shared that although we may be in charge of our individual social media pages, there are other people who own our domain as well.</p>
<p>In George Orwell’s <em>1984</em>, the story focuses on the idea that ‘Big Brother’ is always watching and listening to every small detail of every person’s life. That idea was thought to be crazy, before Edward Snowden released thousands of documents revealing that the government was tracking every small detail of every person’s life, just as ‘Big Brother’ had done in <em>1984</em>. As scary of a thought it is to think that the government and sites such as Google and Facebook know almost everything about us, the truth is, we bring it upon ourselves. When we sign up for media sites, we tend to enter a lot of personal information. It is frightening, but all of our personal information is on the internet, whether we like it or not. We have essentially given ‘Big Brother’ every small detail about our lives just through social media. Pun intended, we are all DOOMed.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How much do we own of what we post online? The photos that I post online are mine, but they can be anyone&#8217;s. Someone can easily screenshot my photo and then they also &#8220;own&#8221; that photo. I have privacy settings so that only my followers that I approve can see my photos but some people are public which means anyone can see their posts. That makes it easier for others that they do not know to then &#8220;own&#8221; their photos. These photos are not tangible. I do not have them printed out I only have them online so if something happens to my accounts or my laptop, I no longer have those photos.</p>
<p>On social media, teenagers take how many likes they get on a photo very seriously. Now a day it is also a big deal how many comments one gets. The commenting on photos is for your friends, but also in a way for yourself to cement that relationship to others. Getting a lot of likes and comments on a photo usually shows that someone is good looking and popular. But that does not mean that someone that does not get as many likes is not popular and good looking. There are other factors that go into getting a lot of likes. For example someone with one thousand followers will get more likes than someone with five hundred followers because more people are exposed to their photo. A lot of thought is put in to posting a photo on Instagram (especially with girls). Then there is a lot less thought put into what photos are posted on Facebook because the likes and comments are not nearly as valued. It is more of an online photo album for themselves and their friends.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cyberbullying is the use of electronic communication to bully a person, typically by sending messages of an intimidating or threatening nature. According to Pew, &#8220;About one third (32%) of all teenagers who use the internet say they have been targets of a range of annoying and potentially menacing online activities &#8211; such as receiving threatening messages; having their private emails or text messages forwarded without consent; having an embarrassing picture posted without permission; or having rumors about them spread online&#8221;. This study was done in 2006; if this study was done today I believe that the percentage of people that have been bullied online would be higher. Social media has become more popular and there are more social medias out there making it more accessible for bullies to target people online.</p>
<p>To no surprise cyberbullying is more common among girls. Girls are pettier and get involved in drama much more than boys do. Girls can also be very passive to one another and take it online instead so they do not need to face the person. Other than being passive, girls get jealous very easily. So if they think a girl is so great and &#8220;perfect&#8221; they will want to find something wrong with her and try to put her down to make her feel bad. Society puts a lot of pressure on girls to be &#8220;perfect&#8221;, even though there is no such thing. Girls want to be the best; it is a constant competition with other girls. Instead of building each other up (as we should), it is often seen that girls try to tear one another down.</p>
<p>Also the article says that intense Internet users are bullied more. The situation is probably the more you use the Internet, the more one uses social media and is posting more. People judge everything, so if they do not like your post for some reason they may feel the need to let you know.</p>
<p>Lastly, I was very shocked to read that bullying happens more often offline. I feel like now a day most bullying happens online. Again, this article is from 2006 so it could be the other way around now. The screen gives people something to hide behind and most likely say things that they would not say in person.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our digital identity is the person we want people to think we are. We only share with the world the things we want them to know about us. We can be whoever we want digitally, because we control what people see. We have all different versions of ourselves. As Sherry Turkle states in <em>Sherry Turkle of MIT: How social media impacts to your identity (Part 2)</em>, &#8220;We have the version of our self we present to our friends and even our families in real life, then we have the version of ourselves we have in our private moments with ourselves, we have the version of our self online like on Facebook or Twitter, and we may have secret accounts where we have another version of our self that we prefer to hide from others&#8221;. We behave differently and express ourselves differently in various settings. I know that I behave in different settings. For example, the head of youth group from my church at home requested to follow my Instagram and I did not let him because it is not professional and I do not need him to see me in a different setting and see what I do outside of the church. My Instagram is for my peers and family to see my photos, I do not need a middle aged man that works at my church to see my photos.</p>
<p>In the other video, <em>Fake It- to control your digital identity: Pernille Tranberg at TEDxOxford, </em>it is actually recommended to use fake identities on social media like Facebook. This way your friends can know that it is actually you. It is like a screen name used for video games and there is a website that creates the fake name for you to make it easy. Creating this fake identity is all about &#8220;Controlling who knows what about you when&#8221; (Tranberg). It isn&#8217;t meant to create a whole other persona, it is to protect yourself from strangers and others that do not need to know everything about you because people (especially teens in my experience) tend to over share on social medias.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When asked to “describe yourself,” the response is usually your name, where you’re from, what organizations you are a part of, and maybe some of your most distinguishing qualities. However, an online identity is a lot more complicated. In her TED talk, Pernielle Tranberg confesses that she had a fake online identity for 5 years to avoid companies from knowing too much (Tranberg, 2013). She pushes her audience to not reveal lots of information online, although many people post everything about themselves on the Internet. Social media has pushed the boundary of what privacy is; the scariest part is that so many people are unaware of their online sense (or senses) of self. In her interview, Sherry Turkle mentions how she met a young man who claims that “Twitter has trained me that I have to be ironic and witty,…but I can’t get followers on Twitter unless I’m a certain kind of ironic and witty person” (Mainwaring, 2011). Personally I can understand the idea of a multiplicity of identities online: I post different photos to Instagram than I would Facebook. Specifically, my Instagram posts are more carefully edited, while I would post almost anything on Facebook. Sherry Turkle wants her audience to embrace the idea of living multiple online lives. Any technological evolution is essentially impossible to reverse, since all information online is saved and used by companies. So while Tranberg encourages us to hide oursleves, Turkle understands that the world is evolving and that us humans need to evolve along with the technology.</p>
