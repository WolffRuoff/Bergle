								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is a fine line between fair use and copyright infringement, especially when it comes to YouTube content. According to Rich Stim, fair use is defined as “any copying of copyrighted material done for a limited and ‘transformative’ purpose, such as to comment upon, criticize, or parody a copyrighted work. Such uses can be done without permission from the copyright owner” (Stim, 2013). With traditional media, discerning what is fair use and what is not may be easier, but the problem has been exacerbated with the introduction of digital media.  On YouTube, “many uploaders do not [address copyright issues] and simply recycle and share copyrighted media with seeming impunity,” while many claim fair use and are still sued regardless (Collins, 2014). The system that YouTube uses to catch copyrighted material is called Content ID, and some claim it is too sensitive. Collins gives many examples of users who used copyrighted material, but claimed fair use in the video’s description, which Content ID does not detect. There are also people who are unaware of fair use and how it could work to their benefit, myself included. For one of my college applications, I needed to submit a dance portfolio via YouTube. One of my background songs got flagged for copyright and I had to find an alternate way to send in my application. I could have claimed fair use, but it would have been extremely difficult to get the video back on YouTube because of how strict these copyright rules can be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I feel that as long as credit is given in the video description, there should be no reason to flag content for copyright. It can be argued that copyright holders putting restrictions on YouTube users will limit creation online. Many artists use others’ work as a starting point for theirs, whether that means making a remix or a parody of the original work. If YouTube’s Content ID continues to be this strict less people will continue to upload to YouTube, possibly leading to a change in the digital space. The types of videos uploaded to YouTube may change and hopefully our online culture is not altered as a result.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When one thinks of copyright law they automatically associate it with a positive. Copyright law was created with the intention of doing right by the public, encouraging self-expression and further promoting the artistic creativity of the public. However, when we begin to look deeper into the law as opposed to viewing it from the surface we begin to see a lot of gray-area evolve, diminishing much of the positive aspects of such law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Today, we are living in a digital world, with a large portion of our lives residing online. With this change one begins to wonder who is protecting our rights in this new world? Are copyright laws thorough enough to address the issues that arise in this new world, and are they efficient enough to take a real stand on the issue of infringement?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The concern associated with copyright laws have been a long time running, and this new world has only exasperated these problems. It appears copyright law has not been able to appropriately keep up with these changes due to the complex and costly legal procedures usually associated with such. This has only further restrained one’s creative expression. Essentially, the matter of copyright law and fair use is subjective. Everything is on a “case-by-case” basis, and as a small player going up against large established company you find yourself fighting an uphill battle that does not appear to be worth the time or money expended. In agreement with Professor Merges “creativity should not be stifled by litigation;” however, on the contrary the law does need to be adjusted to reflect what Mr. Efroni considers the “practical realities of modern life and technological advancements.” The law needs to be looked at objectively, without consideration for profit, modified appropriately, and then enforced in a nonpartisan manner. Copyright law is extremely important to preserving the public’s right to self-expression and continued ownership of individual ideas and ongoing steps need to be taken to maintain these rights.</span></p>
