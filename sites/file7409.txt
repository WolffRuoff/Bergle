								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How much do we own of what we post online? The photos that I post online are mine, but they can be anyone&#8217;s. Someone can easily screenshot my photo and then they also &#8220;own&#8221; that photo. I have privacy settings so that only my followers that I approve can see my photos but some people are public which means anyone can see their posts. That makes it easier for others that they do not know to then &#8220;own&#8221; their photos. These photos are not tangible. I do not have them printed out I only have them online so if something happens to my accounts or my laptop, I no longer have those photos.</p>
<p>On social media, teenagers take how many likes they get on a photo very seriously. Now a day it is also a big deal how many comments one gets. The commenting on photos is for your friends, but also in a way for yourself to cement that relationship to others. Getting a lot of likes and comments on a photo usually shows that someone is good looking and popular. But that does not mean that someone that does not get as many likes is not popular and good looking. There are other factors that go into getting a lot of likes. For example someone with one thousand followers will get more likes than someone with five hundred followers because more people are exposed to their photo. A lot of thought is put in to posting a photo on Instagram (especially with girls). Then there is a lot less thought put into what photos are posted on Facebook because the likes and comments are not nearly as valued. It is more of an online photo album for themselves and their friends.</p>
