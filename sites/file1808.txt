<p>For my word cloud I chose to focus on the internet safety topic we did in class and the guest speaker we had. This topic was very interesting to me and concerning at the same time. With all of the information that people can have on you, from the government to a local pizza restaurant, it is a major concern to our privacy.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Social media has impacted almost all aspects of our lives in one way or another. It changes the way people receive news, travel places, make purchases, communicate, the list goes on and on. Today I am going to focus on social medias impact on businesses. After reading pages 1-25 of Brand Buzz in the Echoverse by K. Hewett, W. Rand, R. Rust and H. Heerde, I have a much deeper knowledge on this topic. Businesses are now realizing that they must take advantage of all of their possible communication tools and a big one, especially in this generation is social media.  Through social media, much can be accomplished and in much faster, precise ways. Social media is a platform that allows a single individual or company to reach millions in seconds by blogging or tweeting  and whatnot. When businesses have news to share or prices to reveal, social media is the ideal place for them to post about it and have it reach millions of possible customers. Almost everyday as I go through my twitter feed,  I will find advertisements for the &#8220;hottest new cloths&#8221; or &#8220;the best deal around&#8221;. These companies are using twitter as  a place to advertise that was not available before. Social media is also important for businesses when it comes to damage control. Bad news travels fast and sometimes it can spell the end of a businesses success. One way that companies are able to contain bad news or in most cases cut their losses is to stay on top of it on social media. Company tweets have been proven to improve bad situations, the more tweets posted by them, results in less negative tweets by other people. Twitter can be so effective in this way as a result of the changing way people receive their news. Social media is a growing factor in the news industry and it has become increasingly clear that people are going through sites like Twitter to find news and information that they would have normally found elsewhere. Compared to the radio, televisions, newspaper and others, social media is faster, more personalized and more accessible. Not all social media sites are equivalent when referring to businesses needs. Twitter has been found to contain more of the information and news sharing as apposed to Facebook which is more personal information and communication. Social media has changed the way businesses operate in many ways, it can help companies with advertisement to crowd control and that will help any business succeed.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While I sat and listened to Jim Groom talk for a total of an hour and 15 minutes, I learned more about the internet and social media sites than I have ever thought I could. So many interesting topics and facts were discussed that it really makes me want to dig deeper on my own to try to understand a little bit better about the web as a whole and how everything works. One very interesting topic we talked about was how the internet and social media sites view us, the user. Most people would answer this as we are humans, easy, but that is not exactly the case. Everything we do on the internet is tracked and stored, the things we posed are used and we are practically working for free. To sites like Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and Twitter, we are merely the product. People use these sites to see what we, as in each other, post, tweet and etc. These sites are using what we do and selling it to people. Come to twitter and see what all your friends are posting, re tweeting and be apart of it all, as you can see, we are what they are selling and we should realize that we are working for free. If you are not happy with being a product, how does being a point of data feel. That is right, many social media sites see us humans as points of data, they collect all the things you do and charting them to see what people are doing, using and what they want. They do not stop and ask you before they do this, they just figure as Jim Broom talked about, the free part of the sites is having no privacy. Once they chart your data they will move to another and keep tallying up their statistics to see what is good for the social media site as a whole. It is said to say, however you are no longer human, you are a product or a point of data.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Social media today has a huge impact on almost all aspects of life. It can influence things like ones education, to ones ability to get a job. I&#8217;m going to focus on the influence social media has on politics. Whether you realize it or not, social media can greatly affect things in politics. We live in the age of technology and the world is more connected as ever, this means that almost anything and everything can be done through the internet. When it comes to politics, social media plays a big role in campaigns. The key point for politicians while campaigning is for them to try to get their message across to as many people as possible to try to earn their votes, technology allows a resource that helps candidates do just that. Things like Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and many other resources can reach millions of people around the world in a matter of seconds, allowing one to spread their message. The method of using social media to an advantage in political campaigns is prominent today in the ongoing 2016 presidential campaign between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. I currently follow Mr. Trump on Twitter and I see how he tries to earn votes every time he tweets. These tweets reach millions on millions of people, allowing him to talk indirectly to his voters at a very fast pace. Now there is a flip side to this, most of the people that are being reached through the internet are the younger, less active block of voters. Reaching out to millions of people is great but who is to say that all those people you are convincing to vote for you are actually going to go out and even vote. This might be the case today, however as explained by Sharon Housley, this younger generation is going to become the older generation and technology will then play an enormous role in our elections. Social media also plays a positive impact in elections through its ability to create an effective way of fundraising. In order for campaigns to run, they need money and a lot of that money is given as support through fundraisers. On a bit of a smaller scale, websites like GoFundMe.com exist today as a place specifically for helping people raise money. Online fundraising can be very effective and it can most certainty help in the fundraising for campaigns. Now these are all some positive impacts technology has on politics, there are many ways technology can be a negative impact for a politician in particular. The saying everything you put on the internet stays there forever, is very much true and well. Everything can be dug up from the depth of the internet and brought back to life, this is also been scene in the Trump vs Clinton election. A commercial, seen a lot not only on television but on Twitter and Youtube, was made by Hillary Clinton and shows an interview done many years back with Donald trump showing him saying he does not have much respect for women. This hurts his reputation towards women tremendously and will for sure put more female votes in the hands of Hillary Clinton. The social media is also a place that spreads news very fast around the world. An audio recording of Mr. Trump has been released that has him talking about women, saying that &#8220;sometimes you just have grab them by the p***y&#8221;. This is a disgusting remark towards women and because of the internet and its social media sites, everyone is aware of Mr. Trumps remarks. As you can see, the internet can be both a helpful hand or a dagger to the heart in terms of its impact on politics.</p>
