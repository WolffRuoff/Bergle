					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I know what you mean Ricky. I grew up the same way pretty much always watching games with my brother no matter the sport. I was not big into sports until my freshmen year of High School. I choose to watch games with him because it brought a special bond like you said. It is a shame because now most families do not watch TV together with Netflix and Hulu. However, TV did always bring a special bond to me and my family also. Also as i got older I started to learn more and more technology. I remember being exposed to video games at very young age because my brother was 7 years older than me. Like you as I got older and older I started to play video games less and less.&lt;/p&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;You prefer playing football, or interacting in person with others, compared to playing the game online or video games. How might that relate to others who prefer the online games over the actual games? Also memories and relationships built through watching together, playing together, and those relationships were stronger with the people and not the technology.&lt;/p&gt;
