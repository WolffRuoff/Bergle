								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Neurodiversity is a perspective that the human brain is a complex ecosystem made up of many different continuums of skills, on each of which all people have varying degrees of ability. Up to this point, neurological disabilities were often thought of within the disease perspective, focusing on the dysfunction of a person. Neurodiversity offers a contrasting view of disability, defining it by the difficulties a person has fitting into society, rather than regarding differences as deficits within a person. In other words, when thinking about disabilities, context is key; whether or not they have a disability, each person has their strengths and weaknesses, and although they may not have much to offer in some situations, they may thrive in others. For example, the DSM-V lists social withdrawal as a deficit of a person with autism spectrum disorder, which certainly does get in their way when confronted with tasks that necessitate social interaction. However, if someone with autism has a job that requires many hours of individual work, social withdrawal may give them a leg up over their “neurotypical” coworkers, who may struggle with the isolation.</p>
<p>This begs the question, how can we, as educators and caretakers apply the less-stigmatizing neurodiversity perspective to ensure the success of children with intellectual disabilities? The answer is to help them with a process which all of us engage in called “niche construction.” For example, I have always found math much more difficult than other subjects in school, and as a result I have chosen not to major in mathematics in college in an attempt to ensure my success and begin to create my niche. Similarly, we must help children with intellectual disabilities to find the situations in which they can be successful. Although it is still important to help develop the skills that a child with a disability struggles with, it is equally important to allow them to develop and even to focus on those which they excel at. By focusing on strengths as well as weaknesses, we can improve the confidence of children with this population, and help them to integrate into society within a niche that suits them.</p>
