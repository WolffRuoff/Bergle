								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This post, I&#8217;m not going to talk about some really cool thing I did this weekend followed by an artsy picture. (Even though I went to a Toga Party which was really fun) I am going to describe a struggle that I, along with other freshman in the first month, am dealing with&#8212; attacking a difficult writing prompt.</p>
<p>It has been preached to me innumerable times that being successful in college writing requires a heightened ability to analyze content and efficiently articulate a point. This is a skill, however, that I am starting to realize is much easier said than done. &#8220;Connecting the dots&#8221; between the author&#8217;s underlying primary theme, multiple published articles, and a primary source, is, I&#8217;m not going to lie, a little bit scary.</p>
<p>I recognize, though, that it is scary in a good way &#8211; if that&#8217;s possible &#8211; because the challenge forces me to think and struggle with the material, ultimately developing that part of my brain. No longer is it sufficient to write a &#8220;five paragraph essay&#8221; with quotes and analysis layered &#8220;like a hamburger.&#8221; College writing begs for so much more in content, style, and presentation.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not like I&#8217;m already an expert by any means in this fancy &#8220;style and presentation&#8221; but, there are people around me who have mastered such techniques. And times like this in which I am having difficulty, reminds me why I chose Muhlenberg in the first place. I have the resources around me to use at my disposal to help and cater to my academic needs.</p>
<p>Right now, I need help overcoming this writers block. So, I contacted my class writing assistant and scheduled a meeting, I texted an upperclassman for advice, and I asked my professor for time to debrief in the next few days &#8211; all steps that I don&#8217;t know would be available to me if I were somewhere other than Muhlenberg.</p>
<p>The ball is now in my theoretical court. Since I wrote this blog as a diversion to actually doing the assignment, I&#8217;m going to get started.. Wish me luck!</p>
<p>By the way&#8230; I lied about not posting an artsy picture- here you go.</p>
