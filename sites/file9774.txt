<p><strong>Women&#8217;s Soccer at Johns Hopkins (Friday, 5:00)</strong></p>
<p>Coming off their thrilling shootout win against McDaniel in the first round of the Centennial Conference playoffs, the Mules (7-10-2) will need another tremendous team effort against Johns Hopkins in the semifinals. The Blue Jays (16-1-1) are ranked fifth in Division III, have won seven of the last eight CC championships and are 8-0 at home this season. They won the regular-season meeting against Muhlenberg, 5-0.</p>
<p>This will be the fifth postseason meeting between the two teams, with Johns Hopkins holding a 2-1-1 advantage. The Mules beat Blue Jay teams ranked in the top 10 in three of the last five years.</p>

<p><strong>Volleyball vs. McDaniel at Franklin &amp; Marshall (Saturday, 3:30)</strong></p>
<p>Two teams that tied for last place in the CC three years ago meet in a semifinal match, with the winner headed to Sunday&#8217;s championship match. It&#8217;s the second postseason meeting between the two schools; the first came in the 1992 MAC playoffs.</p>

<p><strong>Football at Ursinus (Saturday, 1:00)</strong></p>
<p>These two teams are tied for second place in the Centennial Conference and have identical records of 6-2 overall and 5-2 in the league. Muhlenberg comes in on a roll, having won its last four games, all by at least 20 points. Ursinus was 5-0 before the bye week and has been hard to figure out since returning: The Bears lost 28-7 at home to Juniata and nearly won at Johns Hopkins.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg has won 12 of the last 13 meetings to extend its series lead to 45-24-7. The last two meetings came down to the last play, with the Mules blocking a field goal at the final horn for a 24-21 win two years ago and batting away a pass in overtime last season to preserve a 24-17 victory.</p>

			<p><em>Two Muhlenberg teams will be competing for the Centennial Conference championships, two others have already qualified to do so, and two more will try to play their way in. Plus, football&#8217;s Homecoming and the start of winter sports.</em></p>
<p><strong>Cross Country at McDaniel for Centennial Conference Championships (Saturday, 11:00 and 12:00)</strong></p>
<p>The Mules will face strong competition at the conference meet, including several nationally ranked teams in both the men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s races. Last year, the women finished fourth and the men fifth.</p>
<p>Complete preview: <a href="http://www.muhlenberg.edu/main/athletics/fall13/1031.html">http://www.muhlenberg.edu/main/athletics/fall13/1031.html</a></p>

<p><strong>Volleyball vs. Swarthmore (Saturday, 12:00); vs. Moravian (Saturday, 4:00)</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg (18-10, 7-2) hosts two important matches &#8211; for different reasons &#8211; on the final day of the regular season. The Mules have clinched a CC playoff berth and can land a bye to the semifinals (where they would face McDaniel) if they can beat Swarthmore (15-11, 3-6). A loss could drop Muhlenberg to the 4-5 match, which it would host on Wednesday.</p>
<p>In the second match, the Mules will be playing for school pride (and possibly its first 20-win season since 2001) against a 10-20 Greyhound squad that had lost nine in a row heading into a Friday night match. Moravian took a 3-2 lead in the Matte Award race with a women&#8217;s soccer win on Wednesday, and the volleyball team has a chance to even the standings up.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg trails the all-time series against both Swarthmore (17-16) and Moravian (40-9) and has lost five straight to both.</p>
<p>Live stats (both Muhlenberg matches): <a href="http://www.muhlenberg.edu/sports/vblive/topview.htm">http://www.muhlenberg.edu/sports/vblive/topview.htm</a></p>
<p><strong>Football vs. Dickinson (Saturday, 1:00)</strong></p>
<p>Although it&#8217;s Family Weekend at Muhlenberg, it&#8217;s homecoming weekend for the football team, which has not played a home game in almost a month. The Mules (5-2, 4-2) have won each of their last three games by at least 20 points and will look to continue their roll.</p>
<p>Dickinson (3-4, 3-3) has the third-best rushing attack in the CC and attempted only seven passes in last week&#8217;s 38-31 win against McDaniel. But the Devils&#8217; starting quarterback, who ranks second among CC QBs in rushing yards, was injured last week. Muhlenberg is second in the CC against the run, allowing only 114.4 yards per game.</p>
<p>The Mules lead the all-time series, 41-25-2, and have taken 12 of the last 14 meetings, including a 61-21 win last year and a 12-0 shutout in the snow two years ago.</p>

<p><strong>Women&#8217;s Soccer vs. Bryn Mawr (Saturday, 1:00)</strong></p>
<p>Despite losing four in a row, Muhlenberg (6-10-1, 4-5) can clinch a CC playoff berth for the second straight year by defeating Bryn Mawr in its regular-season finale. If the Mules win, they will travel to either McDaniel or Dickinson for a first-round game on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Owls (2-14, 0-9) are winless in their last 17 CC contests and have scored only four goals all season, but they recently snapped a 13-game losing streak with an overtime win against Moravian, a team Muhlenberg just lost to.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg has won 19 straight meetings against Bryn Mawr to take a 20-2 series lead. The Owls have been shut out in their last eight trips to Allentown, dating back to 1996.</p>

<p><strong>Field Hockey vs. Haverford (Saturday, 6:00)</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg (8-8, 6-3) is in the CC playoffs for the first time since 2007 and, unless nationally ranked Ursinus unexpectedly loses to last-place Swarthmore, will face Haverford in a first-round game on Wednesday. The winner of this contest will get to host the rematch.</p>
<p>The Fords (9-7, 5-4) have clinched their fifth straight playoff berth; they reached the CC championship game in 2010 and last year. A Mule defense that is second in the CC in fewest goals allowed in league games (11) faces a Haverford offense has scored 14 goals in its last three games.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg leads the all-time series, 15-11, but Haverford has won four of the last five meetings.</p>

<p><strong>Men&#8217;s Soccer at McDaniel (Saturday, 3:30)</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg (8-7-1, 3-4-1) needs a win and lots of help to make the CC playoffs. But in such a competitive league, almost every game is close and anything is possible.</p>
<p>First and foremost, the Mules must defeat last-place McDaniel (7-6-3, 1-5-2). The Green Terror started off the season with five straight wins, earned a regional ranking and was 6-1-3 a month ago but has lost five of its last six.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg leads the all-time series, 32-7-1, and has never lost to McDaniel: The Mules&#8217; last series loss came in 2001 when the school was still known as Western Maryland. In 11 meetings since, Muhlenberg is 10-0-1 with a 18-1 scoring margin.</p>

<p><strong>Wrestling at Monarch Invitational (Saturday, 9:00)</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg opens its 2013-14 season with its annual trip to King&#8217;s for a 12-team tournament.</p>

			<p><em>As the winter sports season begins to wind down, we take a closer look at Muhlenberg’s senior student-athletes. Over the next week or two, the MuhlBox will feature some of the highlights from the traditional senior question and answer profiles from each sport.</em></p>
<p><em>We start with wrestling, which wrapped up its season on Saturday at the Centennial Conference Championships, where seniors Kevin Homan and John Sternlicht each placed fourth in their final collegiate tournament.</em></p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft" title="Kevin Homan" src="http://muhlenberg.edu/images/main/athletics/men/wrestling/hs/wrest10/homanhs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" />Kevin Homan</strong></p>
<p><strong>How great did it feel winning two tournaments this season? What were the keys to your solid season?</strong></p>
<p>Winning two tournaments felt great. It&#8217;s nice to be having a great season since it&#8217;ll be my last with a great team to practice with everyday. Definitely having a new coaching staff and good people to practice with has made a big difference.</p>
<p><strong>What keeps you pushing through all the pain from training and having to make weight?</strong></p>
<p>The fact that this will be my last season of wrestling is my main motivation. I&#8217;ve been wrestling since third grade, and I&#8217;m going to miss the sport. If there&#8217;s one year to give it everything I&#8217;ve got, this is it.</p>
<p><strong>What’s the first thing you’re going to eat when the season’s over?</strong></p>
<p>Pizza and wings</p>
<p><strong>What’s the most memorable moment from your Mule career?</strong></p>
<p>Making the conference finals as a sophomore is one of my most memorable moments, but I&#8217;ve had several more that are pretty memorable.</p>
<p><strong>What made you decide to become a history major and political science minor?</strong></p>
<p>I was originally in the teaching program and planned on becoming a high school history teacher but decided to change my path later in college. Since I only had a few more classes to complete the history major, I kept with it and picked a political science minor my senior.</p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans?</strong></p>
<p>After graduating, I plan on going to the police academy and eventually become a cop. It&#8217;ll take a while, but it&#8217;s something that I look forward to.</p>
<p><strong>What kind of person is John Sternlicht?</strong></p>
<p>John is somewhat of a flamboyant person, I mean he has a tattoo of a rose on his ankle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft" title="John Sternlicht" src="http://muhlenberg.edu/images/main/athletics/men/wrestling/hs/wrest10/sternlichths.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" />John Sternlicht</strong></p>
<p><strong>How frustrating has it been dealing with injuries for a good portion of your career?</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s extremely frustrating. I&#8217;ve dealt with injuries my entire career, and it often seems like I&#8217;m stuck in an endless pattern of injury, recovery, rebuilding, training and right back to another injury.</p>
<p><strong>What’s the first thing you’re going to eat when the season’s over?</strong></p>
<p>I actually don&#8217;t cut any weight at all. I wrestled at 157 and 165 last year and was up to 184 this year. I&#8217;m actually more likely to eat healthier after the season so I can perfect my “beach bod” in time for the summer.</p>
<p><strong>You once owned the New Jersey record for career pins; how did that feel?</strong></p>
<p>It was pretty cool to hear my name announced in front of about 10,000 fans after breaking the New Jersey state record for career pins. It was broken only a few hours later, but it was certainly a rewarding way to finish out my high school career.</p>
<p><strong>What’s the most memorable moment from your Mule career?</strong></p>
<p>Due to injuries, I haven&#8217;t had much of an opportunity to make many good memories on the mat during my career as a Mule. I will likely never forget how much it hurts to rip both shoulders out.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your greatest off-the-mat accomplishment?</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve accomplished so many of my goals off the mat that it would be impossible to choose between beating Donkey Kong Country for Super Nintendo in 27 minutes, completing the Cluck-U 911 hot wing challenge, and memorizing all of the 33 words that use a &#8220;q&#8221; but not a &#8220;u&#8221; in the Scrabble dictionary. So I guess I&#8217;ll just say it was becoming the youngest black belt in Isshin-Ryu Karate history at age 11.</p>
<p><strong>How hard has it been balancing wrestling and school work?</strong></p>
<p>The toughest part about balancing wrestling with my school work has been finding time to do my work. With practice in the middle of the day, it doesn&#8217;t make much sense to start my work before practice, because by the time I get into the groove I need to leave. After practice I&#8217;m pretty tired and just want to relax. But I&#8217;ve survived by pulling plenty of key all-nighters and just powering through. There&#8217;s always time to rest later.</p>
<p><strong>What made you decide to major in political science?</strong></p>
<p>I came to school freshman year, like so many students here, expecting to follow the pre-med track. That lasted all of about a month. I didn&#8217;t really know what I wanted to study after that, but the 2008 election inspired me to pick up an American government course the following term, and the rest is history (or should I say, political science). I completed all of the requirements for the major three short terms later.</p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans?</strong></p>
<p>I wish I knew for sure, but I&#8217;m still exploring my options. The option I like best so far is becoming a multi-millionaire and spending most of my time on my luxury yacht. As soon as I figure out how to make that kind of money, I&#8217;ll be set. It&#8217;s only a matter of time after that.</p>
<p><strong>What’s Nick Pallotta like off the mat?</strong></p>
<p>There is only one Nick Pallotta. Everybody who knows this Italian stallion knows he&#8217;s the life of the party, but the ones that know him best know him as a loyal and generous friend with a heart of gold. Don&#8217;t let his intimidating physique fool you; he&#8217;s a big teddy bear on the inside. Just ask his girlfriend, Amanda.</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft" title="Nick Pallotta" src="http://muhlenberg.edu/images/main/athletics/men/wrestling/hs/wrest10/pallottahs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" />Nick Pallotta</strong></p>
<p><strong>How have you been able to rack up so many quick pins?</strong></p>
<p>I have been able to rack up so many pins over my career manly because I hit my bread and butter move in the beginning of the match.  It’s a great feeling to get a quick pin because I can save my energy for the next match.</p>
<p><strong>Is it true that all other wrestlers are jealous of heavyweights because they get to eat whatever they want?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, after having to cut to 197 my junior season, I can definitely say that everyone is jealous that I don’t have to worry about making weight anymore.</p>
<p><strong>What was it like taking ballet last year?</strong></p>
<p>Taking ballet was definitely an interesting experience. It was much more difficult than I expected and made me gain a lot respect for all the dance majors.</p>
<p><strong>What’s the most memorable moment from your Mule career?</strong></p>
<p>I would say my most memorable moment during my mule career came my freshman year when we wrestled Johns Hopkins. The match came down to me, and it was great winning the match for the team and tying for the league title.</p>
<p><strong>What made you decide to major in political science?</strong></p>
<p>I decided to major in political science because I plan on going to law school after graduation.</p>
<p><strong>What kind of teammate is Kevin Homan?</strong></p>
<p>Kevin is a great teammate that always brings a positive attitude into the wrestling room despite the many hardships that our team has gone through over the past four years. Kevin is by far the hardest worker I have ever met, and I think that his work ethic is the source of his success.</p>

This weekend, they get their final tuneups.</p>
<p><strong>Men’s Basketball at Ursinus (Saturday, 3:00)</strong></p>
<p>In the CC preseason poll, Franklin &amp; Marshall was picked to finish first, Muhlenberg second and Dickinson third. And even though Dickinson started out 2-4, and Muhlenberg was 4-6 just four weeks ago, that’s exactly the way things could wind up.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-104" title="Mule Marquee Matchup" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1-300x203.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="203" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1-300x203.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>If the Mules (16-8, 10-7) beat the Bears (9-15, 8-9 and out of playoff contention), and Dickinson loses to Franklin &amp; Marshall, Muhlenberg will earn the No. 2 seed and face Dickinson in a CC semifinal next Saturday. If Muhlenberg and Dickinson both win, they will play each other with the Red Devils as the No. 2 seed.</p>
<p>With a loss, the Mules slip to the No. 4 seed, and they would host the loser of the Johns Hopkins-Washington game on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The first pair of Muhlenberg teammates to each score 400 points in a season in 16 years, senior Spencer Liddic and freshman Malique Killing are approaching milestones. Liddic is 22 rebounds away from 1,000, and Killing needs 20 points to break the school freshman record of 419 set by Bob McClure in 1967-68.</p>
<p>Ursinus won the first meeting, 63-61, overcoming a 14-point deficit with 14 minutes to play. The Bears have won the last three regular-season meetings in Collegeville, two in overtime and the other by one point.</p>

<p><strong>Women’s Basketball at Ursinus (Saturday, 1:00)</strong></p>
<p>The Mules are locked into a semifinal playoff game against Franklin &amp; Marshall. They can earn the No. 2  seed with a win and the right combination of other results, but all that impacts is what color jersey they’ll wear in their first playoff game.</p>
<p>There are some team and individual milestones on the horizon. Muhlenberg (19-5, 14-5) will reach the 20-win plateau for the fifth straight year by beating Ursinus. In the College’s athletic history, the only team to post five consecutive 20-win seasons was volleyball (1991-95).</p>
<p>Senior Alexandra Chili, who on Wednesday broke the school record for field goals made by a basketball player (male or female), is within 57 points of the CC career record of 1,965. She hit game-winning last-second shots in two of the three games she’s played at Ursinus.</p>
<p>Ursinus (13-11, 12-7) has clinched a playoff berth but needs a win to secure a first-round home game. The Mules won the first meeting, 72-55, but the Bears are a different team at home, where they are 8-1.</p>

<p><strong>Track &amp; Field at Keogh Invitational (Friday, 5:00)</strong></p>
<p>The Mule teams will try to get a few more athletes qualified for the CC Championships at the site of last year’s conference meet.</p>
<p><strong>Wrestling at Scranton with Johns Hopkins (Saturday, noon)</strong></p>
<p>The wrestlers complete their pre-championship circuit of CC opponents. The Mules are 15-12 in contested matches against CC foes.</p>

			<p>As the end of the season draws closer, the contests grow bigger in importance. And that&#8217;s certainly the case this weekend, with only 15 days left in the regular season.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-104" title="Mule Marquee Matchup" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="237" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg 350w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1-300x203.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" /></a>Men&#8217;s Basketball vs. Franklin &amp; Marshall (Saturday, 4:00)</strong></p>
<p>Franklin &amp; Marshall is 19-1, ranked eighth in Division III and closing in on the top seed for the Centennial Conference playoffs. Muhlenberg is 13-7 and tied for fourth place in the CC, just a game ahead of two other teams with five games to go in the regular season.</p>
<p>While it&#8217;s obviously a big game for the Mules, what makes this the Marquee Matchup is the history of the series. Muhlenberg has five wins against nationally ranked F&amp;M teams at Memorial Hall since the early 1990s, including a 71-67 win last year when the Dips were ranked 19th. The Mules have won nine of the last 14 against F&amp;M at home, and only one of F&amp;M&#8217;s wins was by more than five points.</p>
<p>Then there&#8217;s the presence of two of the &#8220;marquee&#8221; players in the CC. On the league&#8217;s all-time lists, F&amp;M senior Georgio Milligan is second in assists and steals, seventh in scoring and 11th in blocked shots. Muhlenberg senior Spencer Liddic is second in rebounds and double-doubles, 10th in scoring and tied for 16th in blocked shots. He needs 12 rebounds and a double-double to tie the CC all-time marks.</p>

<p><strong>Women&#8217;s Basketball vs. Franklin &amp; Marshall (Saturday, 2:00)</strong></p>
<p>This is a key CC matchup between two teams that are tied for second place in the loss column, two games behind Johns Hopkins. Franklin &amp; Marshall is 14-6 overall, 11-4 in the CC, while Muhlenberg is 15-4, 10-4.</p>
<p>The Mules, who won the first meeting, 62-54, looked like their former selves in beating Swarthmore, 81-46, on Wednesday. The Diplomats are coming off two impressive wins of their own, by 13 points at home vs. Haverford and by 14 points at Washington.</p>
<p>The top three scorers in the CC will be on display in F&amp;M junior Alexa Barbush (17.2 ppg), Muhlenberg senior Alexandra Chili (16.5 ppg) and Muhlenberg junior Alita Zabrecky (15.4 ppg). The Diplomats haven&#8217;t won in Memorial Hall since 2000.</p>

<p>Muhlenberg will send a women&#8217;s distance medley relay to the Armory tonight for one of the most prestigious indoor meets. The Mule quartet is the only Division III team in its heat. The rest of the team will also compete against athletes from higher divisions at East Stroudsburg on Saturday.</p>

			<p>We had a preview of tonight’s indoor track and field meet in The MuhlBox <a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/?p=751">yesterday</a>. Here’s what to look for on Saturday.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-104" title="Mule Marquee Matchup" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="237" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg 350w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1-300x203.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" /></a>Women’s Basketball at Johns Hopkins, 3:00</strong></p>
<p>The top two teams in the Centennial Conference standings meet for the second time in 13 days. Johns Hopkins (16-2, 11-2) won the first meeting, 76-67.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg (14-3, 9-3) is returning to Baltimore for the first time since winning the CC title there last season. Although it is a trip many fans dread, the Mules have won five of their last seven games at Johns Hopkins (counting one against Gettysburg in last year’s CC playoffs).</p>
<p>Since the league’s inaugural season in 1993-94, these two teams have by far the best record in CC games, and they have combined for 10 titles. Johns Hopkins is 241-59 (.803), Muhlenberg is 233-75 (.756), and the next-best percentage is .648.</p>

<p><strong>Men’s Basketball at Johns Hopkins, 1:00</strong></p>
<p>After snapping a three-game skid with a home win against Haverford on Wednesday, the Mules will look to make it two in a row against the team that handed them the first of their five losses in a six-game span.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg led the first meeting, 38-28, at halftime, but was outscored 47-19 in the second half. Johns Hopkins was 4-1 in the CC after that game but has fallen on hard times since. The Blue Jays are in a three-way tie for third with a 6-5 league mark, one game ahead of Muhlenberg.</p>
<p>The Mules have won their last three games in Baltimore, and the last one they lost (in 2008) was in triple overtime.</p>
<p>Game MVPs will be named for both teams following the game as part of Wall-O’Mahony Alumni Basketball Weekend, named in honor of two former JHU basketball players who died in the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center.</p>

<p><strong>Wrestling at Ursinus with Stevens and Merchant Marine, 12:00</strong></p>
<p>No chance of getting snowed out this week. The Mules finally begin their Centennial Conference dual-meet schedule with a quad match at Ursinus.</p>
<p>Some tough competition awaits: Stevens is ranked 29<sup>th</sup> in Division III, Merchant Marine is the four-time defending CC champion, and Ursinus is undefeated in duals this season.</p>

			<p>It&#8217;s the first Saturday of the winter season in which all five Muhlenberg teams are scheduled to compete &#8230; and it&#8217;s supposed to snow. Here&#8217;s what to look for if everything goes on as scheduled:</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-104" title="Mule Marquee Matchup" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="237" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg 350w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1-300x203.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" /></a>Basketball doubleheader at Washington (Saturday, women at 2, men at 4)</strong></p>
<p>Chestertown will be the site for two pivotal games in the Centennial Conference standings.</p>
<p>The 14th-ranked Muhlenberg women (13-2, 8-2) will try to keep pace with Johns Hopkins (a half-game ahead in the CC) against a Washington team that is having an outstanding season. The Shorewomen (11-5, 6-5) have won nine of their last 10, with their only loss coming at Johns Hopkins.</p>
<p>Washington gave the Mules a tough battle when the teams met in Allentown in early December. Muhlenberg had a 15-point second-half lead slashed to five before holding on for a 71-63 victory.</p>
<p>The Mules lead the all-time series 32-4, but their only series loss in the last 16 years came in the 2006-07 season in Chestertown when they were nationally ranked (23rd).</p>
<p>In the men&#8217;s standings, it is Muhlenberg (10-5, 4-5) that is looking up at Washington (10-6, 6-3). The Shoremen won their last two games on the road against teams that handed the Mules their two biggest losses of the season (Franklin &amp; Marshall and Johns Hopkins).</p>
<p>Muhlenberg hasn&#8217;t had much success at the Cain Center, winning just four times in 19 trips since the start of CC play in 1994. Then again, Washington hadn&#8217;t won in Allentown since 1989 before pulling out a 96-93 victory in overtime in the first meeting this season.</p>

<p><strong>Indoor Track &amp; Field at Lehigh Multi &amp; Invite (Saturday, 11:00)</strong></p>
<p>After getting their feet wet at Kutztown last week, the Mules will start to get more of a feel of where they stand in their second meet of the season. The teams are improving the level of competition (at a Division I meet) and the quality of the facility (they will be allowed to wear spikes), which should make for faster times.</p>
<p>Several athletes who did not compete at Kutztown will make their season debuts, and the women will line up 4&#215;400 and 4&#215;800 relay teams.</p>
<p><strong>Wrestling at Gettysburg with Johns Hopkins (Saturday, 12:00)</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg kicks off its Centennial Conference dual-meet season with a tri-match at Gettysburg. Although the Mules do not have enough wrestlers to be successful in dual meets, the individual bouts are important for seeding at the CC Championships.</p>

			<p>It&#8217;s the last full weekend of athletic events in the year 2011.</p>
<p><strong>Basketball Doubleheader vs. Washington College (Saturday, women at 2, men at 4)</strong></p>
<p>Both basketball teams will be playing at home for the first time since winning the Scotty Wood Tournament two weeks ago. Since then, the women have remained undefeated with a pair of wins while climbing up to No. 13 in the national poll, and the men have gone 3-1 with a tournament championship at Gallaudet.</p>
<p>The Mule teams have a combined record of 11-1. The women have won their last two games by 15 points each, and the men have taken their last two by 40 and 23.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not good news for the Washington teams on what is traditionally a difficult trip for them anyway. Since the start of Centennial Conference play, neither the Shorewomen or the Shoremen have won at Memorial Hall. The Shorewomen (2-2 this year) are winless all-time in Allentown, and the Shoremen (2-3) haven&#8217;t won at Muhlenberg since the 1989 Scotty Wood Tournament.</p>

<p><strong>Wrestling at Messiah Petrofes Invitational (Friday, Saturday)</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg visits this pretigious tournament (which used to be hosted by Lebanon Valley) for the 29th time in the last 32 years.</p>

<p>The 30th Scotty Wood Tournament tips off the home basketball season. And after a pair of thrilling wins at Moravian at Tuesday night, anticipation is high, especially with the possibility of a rematch against Moravian in the men&#8217;s championship game. But Immaculata and SUNY Cobleskill will have something to say about that.</p>
