<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Stress Awareness Month</strong></span></p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Relay for Life</span></strong></p>
<p>In May 1985, Dr. Gordy Klatt walked and ran for 24 hours around a track in Tacoma, Washington, ultimately raising $27,000 to help the American Cancer Society fight the nation’s biggest health concern, cancer. A year later, 340 supporters joined the overnight event. Since those first steps, the Relay For Life movement has grown into a worldwide phenomenon, raising nearly $5 billion to fight cancer. Donate or join a Relay for Life team here at Muhlenberg!</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Beating Spring Allergies</strong></span></p>
<p>About 40 million people in the U.S. have some type of “indoor/outdoor” allergy. Research shows that there is a genetic component to allergies. They typically develop during your childhood, but in some people they develop later, after exposure to certain environmental factors such as diesel particulate. One way to beat spring allergies is to treat them early! Spring pollen starts much earlier than people think, so if you take seasonal allergy medications you should start taking them in mid- to late-February. Another way to beat spring allergies is to avoid areas with high pollen and mold, especially when you are exercising. For example, opt for tennis on cement courts instead of going golfing. Also, even though fresh air is good for you, if you have really bad allergies you might be better off exercising inside when the pollen count is high. For those of you that have glasses or contacts, choose glasses over contacts, or wear sunglasses to protect you eyes. Finally, simply washing your hands, rinsing your eyes, and showering can get rid of pollen and mold spores that you come into contact with when you are working outside.</p>

<p>Send Silence Packing is a nationally recognized traveling exhibition of 1,100 donated backpacks, representing the number of college students lost to suicide each year.  The program is designed to raise awareness about the incidence and impact of suicide, connect students to needed mental health resources, and inspire action for suicide prevention.  At each exhibit of  Send Silence Packing 1,100 backpacks are displayed in a high-traffic area of campus, giving a visual representation of the scope of the problem and the number of victims. Muhlenberg has been chosen to host Send Silence Packing this year!</p>

<p>With Thanksgiving and the holidays looming on the horizon, it is important to keep in mind your health, physically and mentally. The holidays can be a stressful time and sometimes we have to step back and pause for a moment to remember that this should be a happy time of year. It is also important to maintain a balanced diet despite all those sweets calling your name.</p>
<p>Staying Healthy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wash your hands often with soap and warm water for at least 30 seconds or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer</li>
<li>Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you sneeze or cough; if a tissue is not handy, use your elbow</li>
<li>Avoid close contact with sick people</li>
<li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth</li>
<li>Stay home if you are not feeling well</li>
<li>Clean and disinfect potentially contaminated surfaces</li>
<li>Get your flu vaccine</li>
</ul>
<p>Holiday Fun:</p>
<ul>
<li>Choose fresh, seasonal fruit instead of candy for your sugar fix</li>
<li>Limit your fat, salt, and sugar intake; balance is everything</li>
<li>Try a new, healthy dish at Thanksgiving dinner</li>
<li>Try to substitute unhealthy ingredients in your favorite dishes with healthier options</li>
<li>Add herbs and spices to dishes for flavor instead of salt</li>
<li>Stay active by dancing to your favorite holiday music selections</li>
<li>Go for a walk outdoors or play in the snow;  fresh air and sunshine are essential in the winter months</li>
<li>Instead of resorting to the snow blower, shovel your driveway</li>
<li>Remember to enjoy the holidays and celebrate friends and family</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanksgiving Meal Tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Leave the skins on when preparing mashed potatoes-they are a source of fiber and potassium</li>
<li>Use whole wheat bread instead of white bread for stuffing</li>
<li>Avoid mixing creamy soups with your vegetable dishes</li>
<li>Try a variety of steamed, green vegetables such as asparagus, brussel sprouts or green beans</li>
<li>Try a low sugar version of cranberry sauce or cut the amount of sugar in the recipe in half</li>
<li>Try a low fat gravy</li>
<li>A variety of foods is healthier than eating too much of one food</li>
<li>It’s all about portion control; avoid going back for seconds</li>
<li>Don’t go overboard on the desserts; go for a pie containing fruit or a low fat ice cream</li>
</ul>
