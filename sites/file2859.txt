<p>RBR-TVBR. (2011, April, 25). In-car streaming perceptions, misperceptions examined. <em>Radio Broadcasting Report.</em> Retrieved from http://www.rbr.com/radio/in-car-streaming-numbers-perceptions-misperceptions-examined.html</p>
<p>With the increasing technological growth and use of internet-streaming radio stations such as Pandora, iHeartRadio, and other cloud-based sites, the public still recognizes that the production and distribution of “over-the-air” terrestrial radio remains one of the most used media outlets while driving.  In a recent Radio Broadcasting Report article, it was made known through a survey of 18-44 year olds, that having streaming-internet radio in cars is not a threat at all to the AM/FM radio stations, or even Sirius/XM.  &#8220;The good news is most users of in-car streaming radio continue to use over-the-air radio extensively&#8221; (rbr.com).</p>
<p><span id="more-1171"></span></p>
<p>Using the Automobile Industry as one of their linking pins, internet streaming radio is trying hard to stream themselves over other industries.  Maybe for the satisfaction of becoming a vertically integrated industry, the internet might be a little over zealous when trying to take over multiple media outlets.  The majority of these blogs have focused on the fact that internet radio sites like Pandora, iHeartRadio and many others are becoming major exhibitors for not only just music, but the recording industry itself.  The popularity of streaming internet stations in the car mostly comes from the linking pin of the cellphone industry.  People are able to buy cables that will simply connect their smartphone to the radio.  They won&#8217;t need to buy a full dashboard radio system that will connect their internet radio to the car.  &#8220;It is thought that most of that listening still occurs at home or at work on computers connected to the internet because of the perceived difficulties related to connecting to the internet in the car&#8221; (rbr.com).  When surveys are taken to see how many people are listening to internet radio, we cannot assume that it is just for the car, all these other media outlets still need to be taken into account.</p>
<p>Within the article there are perceptions noted that describe how certain industry and power roles are concerned with these internet radio stations taking over.  The internet might be able to vertically integrate themselves as producers, distributors, and exhibitors due to the fact that our information age has taken rise <em>because</em> of the internet.  To understand the perceptions (or misperceptions) of the internet radio streaming in cars, it would be better to read the <a href="http://www.rbr.com/radio/in-car-streaming-numbers-perceptions-misperceptions-examined.html">article</a> in full.  But in short the four perceptions are: that streaming is not yet happening in the car, once streaming becomes widely available in cars terrestrial radio will be dead, people won&#8217;t pay for an in-dash solution, consumers will want more pre-sets with in-dash systems.</p>
<p>Although this might be a huge exhibitor power role in the future, in-dash internet radio systems need a lot of adjustment to satisfy the consumer.  Although the client power role of the advertisers might see this as a great deal of business for them, only having one automobile producer and distributor for an internet radio system (Ford and its SYNC system) limits the possibility of substantial profit and growth.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Graser, Marc. (2011, March 31). WB, Sony, U, and Fox cue premium VOD. <em>Variety</em>. Retrieved from <a href="http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118034714">http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118034714</a>.<a href="http://mediaindustries11.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/03/video-on-demand-image-photoshop.jpg"><br />

<p><a href="http://mediaindustries11.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/03/home_theter_04-535x354.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1018" src="http://mediaindustries11.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/03/home_theter_04-535x354-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a>In a controversial business venture that could significantly impact the film industry and its audiences, four major film studios have announced their involvement in the launch of Home Premiere, a premium video-on-demand service for feature films. Beginning next month, Warner Bros., Sony, Universal and 20th Century Fox will offer recently released theatrical films for a $30 fee over a two-to-three day viewing period, at the discretion of each particular studio. Several cable systems will offer the service, with DirecTV launching it initially to its 20 million customers. Warner Bros.&#8217; action thriller &#8220;Unknown&#8221; (2011) and Sony&#8217;s romantic comedy &#8220;Just Go With It&#8221; (2011) will be the first major releases offered via Home Premiere. While discussing the reasons this endeavor has come to fruition, studios have argued that offering these films for the $30 rate 60 days after theatrical release will <em>not</em> harm either box office returns or the financial stability of exhibitors, claiming that films make most of their money at the box office within the first three months. Further, these studios claim that the expense of a night out at the movies for families has harmed them financially between the cost of concessions, tickets, and possible babysitters, and this VOD service seeks to appease this by offering an opportunity to view relatively recent films at a cost that would be lower than an average trip to the theater.<span id="more-1016"></span></p>
<p>However, exhibitors and NATO (the National Association of Theater Owners) have expressed disappointment and anger over their fears of this premium VOD plan having a negative effect on theaters. In a statement, a NATO spokesman recently said, &#8220;They risk damaging theatrical revenues without actually delivering what  the home consumer seems to want, which is flexibility, portability and a  low price. These plans fundamentally alter the economic relationship  between exhibitors, filmmakers and producers, and the studios taking  part in this misguided venture.&#8221; In other words, a prominent concern of the exhibition viewpoint of the industry regards possible repercussions this new service could have on theatrical box office revenues.</p>
<p>Several theater chains, including Regal Entertainment, have threatened studios with the possibility of not releasing particular films if they are released on demand just six weeks after opening. Hypothetically, if Regal were to actually go through with this, it would have a devastating effect on nearly all theatrical grosses, as Regal is the largest theater chain in the U.S. When DirecTV initially proposed the VOD launch in February, they had mentioned the possibility of a short four-to-six week window between theatrical release and VOD release. This was when Regal threatened a boycott, and the four major studios had to intervene and talk DirecTV into lengthening the window to 60 days.</p>
<p>This is a striking example of power roles at work in the industry of motion pictures. In terms of the agreement to extend the window to 60 days from roughly 40, the exhibitors wielded their power over the distributors. Without the cooperation of Regal, the nation&#8217;s most prominent movie exhibitor chain, the studios would stand to lose millions of dollars in this risky endeavor. Although the exhibitors and NATO still seem unsure of Home Premiere&#8217;s possible financial implications, they are nonetheless on board with it, at least for now. It remains to be seen what the future holds for this new service, and whether it will be profitable overall or a financial bust. In the meantime, however, the fight between the different entities involved (specifically the exhibitors and distributors) has revealed a great deal of the number of compromises that go on behind the scenes in the motion picture industry.</p>
