			<p>Spencer Liddic has put up some really impressive numbers during his time with the Muhlenberg men’s basketball team. But in the Mules’ game against Swarthmore last night, he went where only two other players have ever gone in the history of the Centennial Conference.</p>
<p>Liddic tied the conference record with 21 rebounds in the Mules’ 79-56 win over the Garnet. It equaled the mark set in 1995 — fittingly, by a Swarthmore player — and tied in 1997.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/12/liddicreb.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-546" title="Spencer Liddic" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/12/liddicreb.jpg" alt="" width="229" height="526" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/12/liddicreb.jpg 229w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/12/liddicreb-130x300.jpg 130w" sizes="(max-width: 229px) 100vw, 229px" /></a>It was the best rebounding night by a Mule in more than three decades and bettered his previous career-high, also set against the Garnet, by two.</p>
<p>Liddic has led the conference in rebounding each of the past two years and currently leads by more than five per game this season. He has pulled down 44 offensive boards thus far, the next closest CC player has 18.</p>
<p>According to teammate Austin Curry, it is Liddic’s relentless effort that has always made him a great rebounder. But this season, Curry said, he has taken it to an even higher level.</p>
<p>“Spencer is such a great player; he works harder than anyone else every time we step on the floor,” Curry said. “He gives everything he has, and as weird as it sounds, tonight was just another typical effort from him.</p>
<p>“He’s such a great player, and I wouldn’t be surprised to see him break the record this year.”</p>
<p>With 818 career rebounds, Liddic currently ranks seventh on the conference’s all-time list and is just 21 boards away from the top five.</p>
<p>He is averaging 15.1 rebounds per game this season, and is within striking distance of the CC career record of 947.</p>
<p>But for a player whose name appears throughout the Mule record book, including the single-season scoring mark, it was just another day at the office.</p>
<p>Liddic said he doesn’t really pay any attention to the records. What fuels his play in the paint is the desire to win. He has never played for a CC championship and desperately wants to change that this season.</p>
<p>“It feels great to tie the record, but it’s really a tribute to my teammates,” Liddic said. “Swarthmore was doubling me all night, but the pressure wasn’t on me because everyone else performed to their abilities and played well.</p>
<p>“This is my last year, so I want to make it a special season. I don’t care how many rebounds I get, as long as we keep on winning.”</p>

			<p>The Muhlenberg men&#8217;s basketball team spent the three days after Thanksgiving in Washington, D.C. The weekend started with a tour of the U.S. Capitol and ended with the Mules winning the championship of the Gallaudet Holiday Tournament.</p>
<p>Along the way, the Mules learned a little bit about their country and their school, and a lot about themselves and each other. Here&#8217;s what some of them had to say about the trip:</p>
<p><strong>Matt O&#8217;Hara</strong></p>
<p>My favorite part of the tour through the Capitol Building was the video we watched. It took us through the history of America and how it has come together through many obstacles and difficulties to stand now united as one. The main line in the movie was “Out of many, we are one.” That night, at practice, we talked about how our team is battling through our own obstacles and difficulties and how we need to come together, from many, into one.</p>
<p>It was great being in a place steeped with so much history and walking out of that building, learning all types of facts and history, but also things that we could take and apply to our own team to make us become better. The trip was awesome and I believe will be one of the main reasons for what we hope to be a very successful year.</p>

When translated, it means, “Out of many, one,” and it is applied to the great diversities found within America, and how we are able to pull together to create one great country. This phrase soon became our intangible thought of the weekend as we, as a very diverse team with many unique individuals and pieces, focused on how to come together to play and win together.</p>
<p>We did come together to win the Gallaudet championship, however we have a long way to go before we can hang a banner up and win the Centennial Conference championship.</p>
<p><strong>Austin Curry</strong></p>
<p>I really enjoyed the trip as a whole. It was a nice way for our young team to bond and see sites which were, and still are, the center of our country&#8217;s history. By far, besides winning the championship, I enjoyed seeing the statue of [John Peter Gabriel] Muhlenberg in the Capitol Building. I didn&#8217;t realize his importance in our country’s history. I’m expecting our team picture with the Muhlenberg statue to be on the center of the school’s web page. <em>(here it is, below)</em></p>
<p>Also I plan to return to D.C. in order to learn more about the formation and history of our country. The trip planted and grew an interest in me that I never thought I would have.</p>

<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/11/MBBinDC3.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-539" title="men's basketball in Washington" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/11/MBBinDC3-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/11/MBBinDC3-300x225.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/11/MBBinDC3-399x300.jpg 399w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/11/MBBinDC3.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>It was really fun walking around Washington and taking a tour of the Capitol Building with my teammates. Being able to walk around where famous people in history worked is pretty cool when you think about it. It’s a great city and I think everyone should take a trip down there to look at everything it has to offer. As a team, I think we all took a lot away from the experience and we were able to relate some of it to us.</p>
<p><strong>Jesse Lerner</strong></p>
<p>The best part of the D.C. trip for me were definitely all of the team bonding experiences. Joining this team as a walkon freshman made it more difficult for me to just jump right into the mix of a group of guys who knew each other so well already. However, being with the team in D.C. for three days, whether we were touring monuments or playing basketball, really brought us all together and made us an even better team.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/11/MBBinDC5.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-537" title="men's basketball in Washington" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/11/MBBinDC5.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="355" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/11/MBBinDC5.jpg 400w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/11/MBBinDC5-300x266.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/11/MBBinDC5-338x300.jpg 338w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>AJ Dean</strong></p>
<p>The trip to Gallaudet was a much-needed event for the team. Spending time away from the burdens of campus life allowed us to dedicate all our time and energy towards coming closer to one another and developing into a cohesive unit. This showed on the court where we were able to defeat two quality opponents. I believe that as we look back on this team and season in the future, we will view our time in D.C. as the turning point for the Mules.</p>

			<p>It&#8217;s been said many times: The Scotty Wood Tournament is about so much more than basketball. And while the basketball was great &#8211; the Muhlenberg teams swept the championship games for the second year in a row &#8211; here are some of the other things that took place on the court, which contribute to Scotty Wood being a notable annual event for the entire Muhlenberg campus and the community at large.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/11/swt_madeira.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-514" title="Dave Madeira" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/11/swt_madeira.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="332" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/11/swt_madeira.jpg 350w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/11/swt_madeira-300x284.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/11/swt_madeira-316x300.jpg 316w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" /></a>Former men&#8217;s basketball coach Dave Madeira (pictured with Dean of Students Karen Green) received the Scotty Wood Tournament Community Service Award. It was the first time back at Muhlenberg for Madeira since he retired and moved to Charlotte to be closer to his grandchildren following the 2008-09 season. In 22 seasons as head coach, he won 311 games &#8211; more than any other coach in Muhlenberg athletic history.</p>
<p>At halftime of the Muhlenberg women&#8217;s game on Friday, five Mule student-athletes were presented with their plaques for earning Capital One Academic All-America recognition last year. The five Academic All-Americans were the most in a school year in College history. Pictured below, left to right, are Ashley Brewer &#8217;11, Spencer Liddic, Brittany DeAngelis, Michael Baer and the parents of Bobby Torphy &#8217;11, Bob and Marg Torphy.</p>

<p>Balls went back and forth down the court throughout the tournament, with the winning team scoring at least 90 points in four of the eight games. But there was also a ceremonial exchange of balls.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/11/swt_msgball.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-511" title="Madison Square Garden ball" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/11/swt_msgball-290x300.jpg" alt="" width="290" height="300" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/11/swt_msgball-290x300.jpg 290w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/11/swt_msgball.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 290px) 100vw, 290px" /></a>The Wood Family donated to Muhlenberg a ball used in a game between Muhlenberg and Long Island University played at Madison Square Garden in March 1949. Below, Jonathan Sheftel, grandson of Scotty Wood and nephew of Bob Wood, does the honors in a ceremonial jump ball between Leeann Lanza of Muhlenberg and Liz West of TCNJ prior to the women&#8217;s championship game. Lanza won the ceremonial toss, but West won the one that counted a few minutes later.</p>

It’s not a common occurrence.</p>
<p>But that when the Mules reached triple digits, it came in the Scotty Wood Tournament – that’s less rare.</p>
<p>In the 30 years since the start of the Scotty Wood Tournament, Muhlenberg has scored at least 100 points in 12 games. Remarkably, half of those were in the Scotty Wood Tournament:</p>
<ul>
<li>1988 Muhlenberg 104, Haverford 46</li>
<li>1992 Muhlenberg 103, Drew 87</li>
<li>1993 Muhlenberg 109, Eastern Mennonite 47</li>
<li>2003 Muhlenberg 115, Elms 68</li>
<li>2007 Muhlenberg 107, Philadelphia Biblical 37</li>
<li>2011 Muhlenberg 100, SUNY Cobleskill 73</li>
</ul>
<p>In mathematical terms, the Mules have reached the century mark six times in 59 Scotty Wood Tournament games – one every 10. In non-Scotty Wood contests during the same period, Muhlenberg scored 100 six times in 680 games – one every 113 games.</p>
<p>No men’s team has ever scored 100 points in a Scotty Wood championship game, but if the Mules become the first tonight, they will also reach triple digits in back-to-back games for the first time in 43 years.</p>
<p>With the women’s 94-60 win against Shenandoah, the Muhlenberg men’s and women’s teams set a record for combined points (194) on the opening day of the Scotty Wood Tournament. In 2003, the teams combined to score 219 points on the second day.</p>

			<p>Want to see the best in Division III basketball this winter? Come to a Muhlenberg doubleheader.</p>
<p>The D3hoops.com preseason All-America teams were released this week, and of the nearly 400 schools that sponsor men’s and women’s basketball at the Division III level, Muhlenberg was one of only two (Wheaton of Illinois was the other) to have a representative on both teams. Spencer Liddic of the men’s team was named to the second team, and women’s player Alexandra Chili was a third-team selection.</p>
<p>Here’s a quick look at how the two preseason All-Americans compare:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/chili.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-339" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/chili.jpg" alt="" width="138" height="296" /></a>Alexandra Chili</strong></li>
<li>Number: 12</li>
<li>Position: Guard</li>
<li>Hometown: Rockville, Md.</li>
<li>All-Centennial Conference first team: 2010 and 2011</li>
<li>CC Academic Honor Roll: 2010 and 2011</li>
<li>2010 Scotty Wood Tournament: MVP</li>
<li>Career points scored: 1,497</li>
<li>Rank on Muhlenberg all-time list: Third</li>
<li>Career average: 17.4 ppg</li>
<li>2010-11 average: 18.8 ppg</li>
<li>2010-11 CC scoring rank: First</li>
<li>2010-11 NCAA scoring rank: 27th</li>
<li>Career high: 33 vs. Moravian as a freshman</li>
<li>First career game: 6 points, 6 assists vs. St. Elizabeth</li>
<li>Not just a scorer fact I: Set school record for assists by a freshman</li>
<li>Not just a scorer fact II: Eighth on all-time blocked shots list (really)</li>
<li>Wow! record broken last year: Needed only three seasons to break CC career record for three-pointers</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/liddic.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-340" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/liddic.jpg" alt="" width="138" height="296" /></a>Spencer Liddic</strong></li>
<li>Number: 34</li>
<li>Position: Forward</li>
<li>Hometown: Clarks Summit, Pa.</li>
<li>All-Centennial Conference first team: 2010 and 2011</li>
<li>CC Academic Honor Roll: 2010 and 2011</li>
<li>2010 Scotty Wood Tournament: MVP</li>
<li>Career points scored: 1,221</li>
<li>Rank on Muhlenberg all-time list: 15th</li>
<li>Career average: 15.7 ppg</li>
<li>2010-11 average: 20.4 ppg</li>
<li>2010-11 CC scoring rank: First</li>
<li>2010-11 NCAA scoring rank: 30th</li>
<li>Career high: 35 vs. Washington College as a junior</li>
<li>First career game: 8 points, 9 rebounds vs. Hunter</li>
<li>Not just a scorer fact I: Led CC in rebounding last year</li>
<li>Not just a scorer fact II: Seventh on all-time blocked shots list</li>
<li>Wow! record broken last year: Broke 40-year-old school record for points in a season</li>
</ul>
<p>The two have a lot in common, from their academic and athletic successes at Muhlenberg to mutual respect for each other.</p>
<p>“Spencer Liddic will have always have a talent that I will never be able to possess; the dunk,” said Chili. “Often, I&#8217;ve asked Big Spence, ‘Will you teach me how to dunk? Teach me, teach me how to dunk,’ and even with his best efforts, the second-team preseason All-American has had little success. I recognize that the fault lies in my own athletic shortcomings and that maybe it&#8217;s time I try to pass something on to Spencer. I think the behind-the-back pass will fit into his repertoire perfectly.</p>
<p>“Boasting a D3hoops.com all-region first team and a unanimous All-Centennial Conference selection for the second year in a row, Spencer&#8217;s junior year sealed his fate as one of the most influential men&#8217;s basketball players of the Muhlenberg program. I know his senior year will only be better. This season, not only will Spencer stun the crowd with his unstoppable double-doubles, beautiful elbow jumpers and sweet post moves, he will continue to be a great senior leader. His hustle on the court never stops and he truly inspires all his teammates, and even the women&#8217;s team, to play better. I&#8217;ve been fortunate to share the spotlight the past few years with the stellar Spencer and I can&#8217;t wait to start our seasons up against Moravian on November 15! I know it will be a great year for all of us.”</p>
<p>&#8220;It has been such an amazing experience getting the opportunity to watch Alex Chili grow and mature over the past few years into the dominant player she is today,&#8221; said Liddic. &#8220;Her most obvious threat is her unbelievable shooting ability. She has had players attempt to faceguard her since freshman year, and nothing seems to stop her. Another one of Alex’s strengths is her ability to find her teammates. Over the past three years, she has impressed the crowd over and over again with her behind-the-back passes and alley-oops to various high-flying dunkers on her team.</p>
<p>&#8220;Players like Alex only come around once in a lifetime and it’s an honor to have the opportunity to watch her play since freshman year. I look forward to once again watching Alex dominate the court and can’t wait to see which Muhlenberg, Centennial and D3 record she will be breaking this year.&#8221;</p>

			<p><em>We asked several Mule athletes who hail from New York City to give their remembrances of 9-11.</em></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/vaughnhs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-111" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/vaughnhs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Isaiah Vaughn, Football (Bronx)</strong></p>
<p>Back in &#8217;01 I remember being in school on 9/11. I was in middle school, not sure what grade but the day started off as a typical day in school. Then all of a sudden I remember that there were no more classes, and all the classes were in their homeroom gathered around their teachers as the teachers tried to explain what was going on to us. I had heard that there had been a terrorist attack but I think I was too young to fully understand what it meant.</p>
<p>Looking out the window in my homeroom class, we were able to see the smoke from the Twin Towers being knocked down as everyone waited to be picked up early from school. My mother worked at my middle school, so it wasn&#8217;t long before we were on our way home. What I remember most was the overall quietness of the school. On a typical day the hallways are quite loud so this was confusing to me. There was a saddened mood going on around the school and again I think I was too young to understand why.</p>
<p>When I got home I remember seeing the video and images of the Towers being knocked down again and again since it was on every news channel. You could hear the people screaming in panic from the tragic incident. I feel that the impact of this event created an increased awareness of terrorism, not only in NYC but in America. Our safety as Americans had been challenged. All across the country, security and other efforts were stepped up to stop this from possibly happening again. But deaths and events that went down on 9/11 will never be forgotten. </p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/hargrovehs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-112" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/hargrovehs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Kevin Hargrove, Basketball (Queens)</strong></p>
<p>I was 10 when 9/11 occurred. My school was closed due to an infestation of fleas, so I was home sleeping when the first tower was hit. My brother woke me up and told me but I didn&#8217;t believe him, so I went back to sleep, and my brother again woke me again to tell me about the second tower. I finally got up to meet my mom and younger sister eating breakfast.</p>
<p>We didn&#8217;t have any family member that worked anywhere near there or was a fireman or policeman, so we weren&#8217;t directly affected. The only person I knew who was affected was my friend&#8217;s uncle who died. It was a terrible day for all and we&#8217;ll never forget it.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/davishs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-114" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/davishs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Darnell Davis, Football (East Harlem)</strong></p>
<div>What I remember is that I was in the fourth grade when it happened. All the parents of my classmates came to pick them up during the middle of school, and I had no idea what happened until I got home that day. It was all over the news for about a week. After 9/11 happened, though, you started seeing a lot of American flags on trains and on trucks and all other public service vehicles. You felt a sense of pride and togtherness while you walked the streets.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/newcombhs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-115" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/newcombhs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Kieran Newcomb, Cross Country (Brooklyn)</strong></div>
<div> </div>
<div>I actually did not live in New York City at the time. I was living in Chicago, but I do have friends who were in school right near the towers when they fell, and they had to be evacuated or had to stay in their school buildings and wait for the smoke to clear. I also have friends who had parents that died in the attacks. All of my friends remember the day vividly. They all say that it was a day where the city came together. That being said though, they all say that it was a day of horror and confusion.</div>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/malandruccolohs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-113" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/malandruccolohs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Frank Malandruccolo, Football (Brooklyn)</strong></p>
<p>I was in fifth grade when it happened. I don&#8217;t remember much but I do remember a giant state of confusion. I think it gave New Yorkers and Americans a greater sense of American pride. I remember seeing almost every house having an American flag.</p>
