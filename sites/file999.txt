Based on the Guide to the House and Senate Members and information in the Congressional Pictorial Directory, the app allows users to browse for Members of Congress by last name, state, chamber, or party. Additionally, users can search by first and last name.<\/p>\n<p>Of the new app, Public Printer Bill Boarman says, &#8220;GPO has experienced an incredible transformation in its 150 year history from handset type to handheld devices. We are very excited to release our first app for the public and provide a tool that will connect the public with Members of Congress. GPO looks forward to developing more apps in the future to provide the public with new options for accessing Government information.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0To access the app on your mobile device, go to<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: xx-small\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff;font-size: xx-small\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff;font-size: xx-small\"><a href=\"http:\/\/m.gpo.gov\/memberguide\">http:\/\/m.gpo.gov\/memberguide<\/a><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-size: xx-small\">\u00a0 or scan the QR code with your mobile device that is available at <\/span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff;font-size: xx-small\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff;font-size: xx-small\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.gpo.gov\/mobile\/\">http:\/\/www.gpo.gov\/mobile\/<\/a><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-size: xx-small\">\u00a0.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Supported Devices\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>* iPad or iPhone (iOS 4.3.3 or higher)<\/p>\n<p>* Android devices (Android 2.1 or higher)<\/p>\n<p>* Blackberry devices (Blackberry 6.0 or higher)<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\u00a0The U.S. Government Printing Office (GPO) has released its first mobile Web application (app), which provides the public with quick, easy access to information on Members of Congress.
