								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>All week we (wrestlers) just like anyone else, know Saturday is coming. For most, the day represents relaxation and entertainment. Saturday is when you get to take a break from all the stress and difficulties that weigh down the conscious during the week.</p>
<p>Not for us wrestlers. Not even close actually. Saturday for us is the day to step on a mat with another college wrestler and fight to achieve our goals. To describe a match any other way than a fight would be misguided as well. While we respect our opponent fully, he is trying to take away the victory that we work tirelessly to attain. No competitor in their right might would ever give up that claim of success without first surrendering blood, sweat, and tears.</p>
<p>I rise in the wee hours of the morning, 4:46am on this occasion, to begin the physical preparation to compete. The night has been largely restless and sleepless because my mind has been racing far to fast to drift off. My mouth is dry from thirst and my belly growls with aggression, but my visualization of winning distracts such discomforts.</p>
<p>I make my way to the wrestling room to check weight. I know that I have to be under 165 to even be eligible to take the mat, but I honestly do not know where I am at. That unknowingness is one of the most daunting and eery feelings. I step on the scale&#8230; The three dotted lines move in a wave length pattern, giving enough time to say a short prayer or allow an unwanted stream of consciousness to creep in.<br />
&#8230;165.4</p>
<p>Half a pound &#8220;over weight.&#8221; A feeling of disappointment and slight anger rush through my veins. 20 minutes of the bike and relentless spitting later, mind you, it has just broke 5am, and I am slightly &#8220;under weight&#8221; at 164.9.</p>
<p>Us seven freshman taking the mat today are ready to go. Yes, seven. While most teams have at least 30 guys, bigger wrestling rooms, and more coaches, we frankly don&#8217;t care. Because that is the beauty in wrestling, it is just you and the other guy out there. I know how hard I worked, and I doubt the opponent soon to be in front of me did as well in equal caliber. Therefore, I have nothing to worry about.</p>
<p>The bus ride to Ursinus College, is the calm before the storm. Few words are said as some of us stare out the window in thought and others take naps. This is the time to gather a wandering psyche and check the readiness of the mind.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what is going to happen out there, but I do know that I am ready. Even if I don&#8217;t fully believe it, I have an obligation to convince myself it is true.</p>
<p>We arrive. In what seems like no time, the multitude of teams populate the mat. Division 1 powerhouses such as Naval Academy, American University, Franklin and Marshall, and Columbia, among others, are present.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bout 53, Jake Gordon, Muhlenberg report to mat 3&#8221;</p>
<p>This is my time, I got this- I repeat in my head. As I look across to see my opponent, I notice that I am wrestling a division 1 kid from Frankin and Marshal.</p>
<p>The action begins and is relentless. He gets the first takedown, I&#8217;m down 2-0. Then I escaped and get my own takedown, I&#8217;m up 3-2. In a flurry of action lasting over 10 minutes, I came out on top. I won! My first win in the books, and against a D1 guy!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m elated, this feels surreal. What an experience. This makes every moment of brutal practice, lifting, conditioning, and cardio, worth it. This is why I do it.</p>
<p>I have a long road ahead to climb, but getting over this hump has meant the world.</p>
<p>Until next time,<br />
Jake</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>During most of the preseason, from August until last week, a sense of unknowing permeated the wrestling team. Most fundamentally, the other 7 freshman and I do not yet know what the rigors of a collegiate season will entail. Wrestling, notoriously, has one of the most grueling seasons in all of sports, which is only intensified at a higher level.</p>
<p>Understanding this, I showed up for my first practice of the season eager to begin the sport I love in an unfamiliar setting.</p>
<p>For two hours and change, the team did hundreds of reps in our &#8220;go to&#8221; shots and attacks. We did drills to emphasize good habits, all of which were exhausting, and did live wrestling in the latter part of practice. To conclude, the team did conditioning competitions that tested pull-ups, push-ups, rope climbs, sprints, bear crawls, jump squats and many more.</p>
<p>It was a highly productive first day of what is a long season to come. I began the day weighing 171.6 and finished up around 166.8. Don&#8217;t worry, I re-hydrated, but undoubtedly the difference between high school and college is 180 degrees. Many wrestling updates to follow.</p>
