								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>People today have grown up putting their everyday lives on social media. Everything that they have done and want people to know have gone up on some sort of social media whether it was a Facebook post, a tweet, a Snapchat story, or an Instagram photo, it was almost as they have to share their successes and experiences with their peers. But it is crucial to remember that once you upload something onto the internet it is never really gone.</p>
<p>This is where cyberstalking can come into place, cyberstalking is when an individual or group use the internet to stalk or harass an individual. Most cyberstalking is intended as an act of revenge or blackmail towards an individual or group who want something and intend to get it at all costs. With peoples lives on the internet it is very easy for hackers or even people without any hacking skills to retrieve data about someone that may be used to blackmail or harass someone with. With bad cases of cyber stalking generally the stalking moves from online to real life. The Wikipedia mentioned, “Even police and prosecutors find themselves at risk, as gang members ad other organized criminals find out where they live—often to intimidate them into dropping a case” (Cyberstalking, 2015). Gangs find a way whether or not it is through the internet or in person to locate their target and track them down in order to harass or even threaten the individual to back off. “[A] final report states that approximately 1.2 million victims had stalkers who used technology to find them” (“Cyberstalking, 2015). This is why it is important to be careful online because when people start to become reckless and don’t take certain precautions when posting something online they are an easy target for people to take advantage of. However not all cyberstalking is used to the extreme like these gangs, there is cyber trolling. It is important to distinguish the difference because trolling is generally harmless where as stalking is more persistent and causes problems for the victim.</p>
<p>As teenagers most would end up cyber trolling, it is very common for you to end up on someone’s Facebook page and then then see someone really pretty or attractive and then go to their page and so on so forth. Soon enough you might find yourself on your friends best friends, dads cousins friends daughters profile without even realizing how many people you have gone through. It’s easy to get caught up in the moment of innocent stalking but it is important to realize that attackers are able to do this but with a higher purpose in mind.</p>
<p>Over all it is important that you monitor what you put online because attackers will find a way to cyber stalk you and collect information that is just meant for friends and families to see, only for people you trust.</p>
