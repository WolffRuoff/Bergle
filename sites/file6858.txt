								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In today’s typical job interview, employers spend less time testing candidates on specific technical knowledge or practiced tasks like typing, math knowledge, and industry related procedures than before. What’s their new focus? Soft skills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Soft skills are less about memorization, more about interpersonal interaction like critical thinking, team-building, and communication. Having a degree already demonstrates a level of competence with the hard skills of a given industry, but modern companies are quickly realizing that’s only one part of what makes the ideal employee. Equally important is the overall takeaway from classes, and development of these soft skills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So how can you prepare for your job hunt and make sure you’re developing the right skillset to help you succeed in your chosen career path? There are a few key focus areas employers look for across the board, that benefit employees at all levels, in any position.</span></p>
<p><b>Powerful Communication</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In nearly every situation, whether it’s at work or in a social encounter, strong and clear communication skills are important. Clearly defining intent and purpose with language in writing or vocally can prevent miscommunications and confusion, and employers consider that a key, universal skill. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Professor David Scobey, an American studies and history professor at the University of Michigan, said in an </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2018/04/18/600855667/what-adult-learners-really-need-hint-its-not-just-job-skills"><span style="font-weight: 400">interview with NPR</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, “employers complain they can&#8217;t find workers with communications, problem-solving and other soft skills.” With these skills in high demand and low supply, those that demonstrate solid communication can find themselves becoming a valuable asset in any group. If everyone is communicating clearly, mistakes are less likely to happen, and workflows can move more quickly and efficiently. </span></p>
<p><b>Effective Teaming</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Communication is a major aspect of working as a part of a team, either as a leader or a member. Part of being a member of a team is listening to others and recognizing the abilities of everyone involved. Leah Weiss writes in “</span><a href="https://bized.aacsb.edu/articles/2019/january/the-case-for-soft-skills"><span style="font-weight: 400">The Case For Soft Skills</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">” that in “a study of more than 10,000 HR participants, companies are actively seeking to assemble adaptable and ‘team-centric’ workplace teams in order to meet future needs.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Companies are thinking of the long-term when it comes to hires. With the ever changing landscape of technology and the market, hiring for specific technical skills is less important than someone who fits with the company socially. A team that can work together effectively and create a kind of synergy can collectively elevate the environment of a business.</span></p>
<p><b>Problem Solving</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is impossible to plan or train for every eventuality, so employers are looking for candidates that can adapt and find solutions to situations as they come up. Critical thinking is crucial to a developing workplace. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nicole Fallon, </span><a href="https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/7532-critical-thinking-in-business.html"><span style="font-weight: 400">in her review</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> of Jen Lawrence’s “</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Engage-Fox-Business-Critically-Motivating/dp/1626341230?&amp;tag=businessnewsdaily-20"><span style="font-weight: 400">Engage the Fox: A Business Fable About Thinking Critically and Motivating Your Team</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">,” said that, “critical thinking helps employees gather all of the information required to analyze a situation, generate optimal solutions to a problem and get feedback from all the people involved in the situation.” Using this honed and developed skill of critical thinking, workplaces become more efficient, and generally continue to improve over time. </span></p>
<p><b>Emotional Intelligence</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When working in a career, or any workplace for that matter, connecting with others is almost always a necessity. Communication is definitely a part of that, but the ability to identify with and earn the trust and respect of others can make teamwork that much easier. Dr. Deborah Benson, the owner of L4L Leadership, </span><a href="https://www.director.co.uk/developingyour-leadership-skills-18125-2/"><span style="font-weight: 400">said in an interview with Director Magazine</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> that, “If people don’t trust you they won’t wish to follow you. If, for example, you do not have the emotional intelligence to understand why a member of staff is resisting instructions and behaving poorly you will struggle to bring them on board.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Essentially, if coworkers do not identify with the leader in the room, it’ll be more difficult to effectively work together. Exercising these interpersonal skills, building an emotional intelligence, and working to establish stronger connections go a long way when establishing a strong workplace community. </span></p>
<p><b>What Hiring Managers Want</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">More and more, hiring managers are looking to soft skills to help determine who is the best for an open position. They are seeking out those who can consistently connect with others in the workplace  and make emotionally intelligent decisions and judgement calls. Critical thinking can ensure that regardless of what situations may arise in the workplace, employees will be able to address whatever may come up. A strong team-based work environment ensures that every member of the business feels supported, boosts productivity, and secures employees for the long-term. Effective communication can help with streamlining processes and improves workplace efficiency. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In this ever changing jobs market, technical proficiency is always important, but these soft skills are becoming increasingly crucial to advancing in the workplace. Strengthening these skills must be a priority when looking ahead for future members of the workforce.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Unfortunately, too many people often find themselves unable to find a job in a career they wanted to pursue or find themselves pondering if they’re truly passionate about what they received their degree in. These are frustrating dilemmas to face. Luckily, there are options available for students wishing to change their career path or gain additional skills to better aid them for the career they want.</p>
<p>While the job hunt may feel suffocating, there are many careers paths that have seen significant growth over the course of the last decade which are continuing to thrive in today’s economy. If you’re looking for a career change, the following paths may be worth the investment.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/pictures/efkk45fmhd/the-jobs-with-the-brightest-future-2/#7612b7e940b1">Forbes Magazine</a>, the following careers are likely to experience strong growth by 2020, compared to their employment totals in 2010: The amount of <strong>registered nurses</strong> is expected to grow by 711,900 positions by 2020.</p>
<p><strong>Office clerk</strong> jobs are projected to by nearly 489,500 jobs, increasing the need for financial and accounting education.</p>
<p>The need for <strong>postsecondary teachers</strong> is expected to balloon by 305,700 positions by 2020, which requires detailed education in all subject areas.</p>

<p>Careers in computer science and information technology are growing rapidly, as the bureau expects opportunities as <strong>software developers</strong> and <strong>computer applications developers</strong> to increase by to go up 31 percent by 2026.</p>
<p>Also expected to increase is the need for <strong>mathematicians</strong>, which the bureau projects to increase by 30 percent in the ten-year time span. On average, the median salary for mathematicians was $105,810 in 2016. A mathematics degree is a suitable education path to pursue if interested in being a mathematician.</p>
<p>The BLS also <a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/business-and-financial/accountants-and-auditors.htm">expects</a> there to be 139,900 new jobs for <strong>accountants</strong> and <strong>auditors </strong>by 2026, which can be pursued with degrees in accounting, finance or related fields.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to a report by the National Commission on Teaching and America’s Future, the United States will lose approximately 2 million teachers in the next ten years to retirement. On top of that staggering number, over one-third of new teachers will leave the classroom within five years for other reasons. That number is even lower when it comes to urban school districts, where one in five will leave after only one year. This opens the door for fresh teachers with a modern outlook, and an&nbsp;active, student-centered pedagogy to enter the school system.</p>

<p>Teaching is no longer the short work day, week or year most people perceive it to be. Effective teachers today log countless hours to not only grade students’ work, but to create multiple&nbsp;activity-based lesson plans to meet the needs of children with different skill levels, learning styles, backgrounds, interests, and motivations.</p>
<p>Great teachers&nbsp;are continuously reevaluating their effectiveness and looking for ways to improve the classroom learning experience for their students, and to push their students to meet the high expectations that have been set. Effectively engaging students to be interested in their own learning, and motivated to learn, takes patience, resiliency, creativity and passion.</p>
<p>Teaching can be a demanding and taxing profession, but it is also one of the most energizing, stimulating, and rewarding jobs you will ever find. It is a profession in which you will learn and do something new every day.</p>
<p>I explored several options throughout the Lehigh Valley and when I met with Dr. Priscilla Howard, Director of Teaching Certification at&nbsp;the Wescoe School, I immediately knew this was the school for me.</p>
<p>For over a century,&nbsp;the Wescoe School&nbsp;has been educating teachers through an outstanding and prominent Teacher Certification Program. Since I entered this program, I have become aware of how highly regarded&nbsp;Muhlenberg&nbsp;is for its academic excellence, and that it is seen as one of the top certifying institutions by the Pennsylvania Department of Education.</p>
<p>This reputable program focuses on two aspects of becoming an effective teacher:&nbsp; content knowledge and classroom experience. Students must possess or work towards a bachelor’s degree in a given major while gaining real world, hands on experience at schools throughout the Lehigh Valley. From the very onset, students are in the field gaining valuable practice and involvement in working classrooms. A broad range of settings and grade levels are offered so students are able to accumulate a vast appreciation&nbsp;and familiarity of the classroom, often helping to clarify personal goals and aspirations.</p>

</div>
<p>Small class sizes, evening classes, and personalized attention from incredible teachers have provided me with the confidence and understanding I need to succeed. I recognize&nbsp;the Wescoe School&nbsp;is the school that will best prepare me for the challenges that lie ahead, and I know I will be a better teacher because of it.</p>
