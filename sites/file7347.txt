<p>            The proliferation of new technology has brought to the national forefront a new form of bullying. Unlike traditional bullying, cyberbullying is a more insidious, prevalent and difficult to trace form of abuse and the number of cyberbullying incidents seem to be growing in epidemic proportions. With the burgeoning advancements in technology, people now have the ability to instantaneously communicate with others through various technological mediums&#8211;internet, text messaging, social networks, and video games. Consequently, this provides multiple forums for disseminating information and an outlet for hurling anonymous insults and harassing comments. Is there not a way to combat cyberbullying? So far, the answer seems to be no.  No one seems to be shielded from its reach.</p>
<p>Brittan Heller, the Anti-Defamation League’s first director of technology and society discusses her own personal experience, as well as, others experiences with cyberbullying in a recent article in the New York Times titled “What It’s Like to fight Online Hate” (2016). Heller, a Jewish American woman, was flooded with sexist anti-Semitic comments on her Twitter account just moments after the A.D.L announced her hire in early September. She understood that cyberbullying was prevalent in our environment today, but even she was amazed and troubled with the speed and maliciousness in which these attacks were made. Everywhere she turned she was confronted with images of swastikas taunting her about her Jewish heritage and death threats all because she was appointed to this incredibly prestigious position.</p>
<p>The mental and emotionally consequences suffered by countless numbers of cyberbullying victims are resulting long lasting effects. In today’s age technology allows a tormentor to go where bullies where afraid to go in the past. A crisis exists and it needs to be stopped.  If nothing is done soon, increasingly more and more people will be directly affected by this everyday creating a culture where you are forced to conceal your true feelings for fear of public scrutiny, ridicule and humiliation.</p>
