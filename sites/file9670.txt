In scrupulous compliance with publisher wishes, Trexler Library has hired a student employee whose sole duty is to monitor reading of the print copy of the New York Times available at the library&#8217;s reference desk. Once the 20-article limit has been reached in a given month (the designated student will keep a careful monthly tally), the student will grab the paper from the (unsuspecting? blissfully unaware? sneaky?) non-home-delivery reader&#8217;s clutches and prevent all further contact with the paper for the remainder of the month&#8211;come hell or high water. At the beginning of the new month, all non-home-delivery readers start with a blank slate, and can again beginning reading the beloved NYT to their 20-article-limit heart&#8217;s content. The library urges careful selection of reading material by all its non-home-delivery patrons so as not to waste one&#8217;s valuable 20-article allotment.*<\/p>\n<p>Happy April Fools!<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><em><strong>Online Access to the New York Times<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>In all seriousness&#8230; the New York Times at this moment does not offer institutional subscriptions to the web edition of the NYT.

For example, the query [ iraq site:nytimes.com ] will return pages about Iraq but only from nytimes.com. The simpler queries [ iraq nytimes.com ] or [ iraq New York Times ] will usually be just as good, though they might return results from other sites that mention the New York Times. You can also specify a whole class of sites, for example [ iraq site:.gov ] will return results only from a .gov domain and [ iraq site:.iq ] will return results only from Iraqi sites.&#8221; See this and more search tips from\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.google.com\/support\/websearch\/bin\/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=136861\">Google<\/a>.
