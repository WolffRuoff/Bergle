								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>Bet you thought I forgot about you all! I promise this has been the first second I have had free since classes began at the end of August, but now I&#8217;ve got a domino&#8217;s pizza (chicken, bacon, and ranch if anyone was curious), a warm blanket, and some Spotify to help me reminisce about the good old days (&#8230;.last month) when we closed SDP.</p>
<p><a href="http://sedehidiversityproject.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2017/09/047.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-419 " src="http://sedehidiversityproject.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2017/09/047-e1505698798479-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="427" height="320" srcset="http://sedehidiversityproject.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2017/09/047-e1505698798479-300x225.jpg 300w, http://sedehidiversityproject.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2017/09/047-e1505698798479-768x576.jpg 768w, http://sedehidiversityproject.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2017/09/047-e1505698798479-1024x768.jpg 1024w, http://sedehidiversityproject.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2017/09/047-e1505698798479-624x468.jpg 624w" sizes="(max-width: 427px) 100vw, 427px" /></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;m not going to give you an in depth summary of the last week of the process mainly because I don&#8217;t remember every single thing that happened this late in the game; that entire week was one huge blur. It seemed like we ate, slept, and breathed SDP even more than usual, finalizing the technical aspects of the show and still making additional edits to the script throughout the week leading up to the weekend shows. Our first performance was for the post-show discussion facilitators on Tuesday and they absolutely loved it! We got some great feedback from this audience which was extremely helpful when going into the athletes&#8217; shows on Wednesday. We then had Thursday and Friday to work out additional kinks and soon enough it was already Saturday! Saturday and Sunday went by just as fast as everyone warned it would. Even though we did 3 shows each day, it still seemed like I blinked up in the tech booth and suddenly everyone was gone and we had one performance left: the Sunday night community show.</p>
<p>Now, I was told by multiple people involved in last year&#8217;s production that the Sunday evening community show is a complete game changer, and that it&#8217;s one of the best parts of being in SDP. This performance is open to the public, but is typically filled with current Muhlenberg students or recent alumni. Therefore, this show is usually the one filled with the most loving, supportive, and responsive audience out of all of them, almost overwhelmingly so. In fact, when I arrived at the theater that night at the ensemble call time, the box office lobby was already filled to the brim with excited audience members waiting to be let in. Thankfully, I had the help of my trusty number one, Bree Booth, some of my other friends, and my boyfriend to worry about crowd control, seat availability, ticket distribution, and other stress-inducing tasks so I could focus on making sure everyone was entering the space safely and felt happy and excited for the show among all the chaos. After what seemed like forever, everyone finally had a seat, there was a contagiously exciting buzz louder than the music, and we were able to start the show.</p>
<p>Bree walked out for her pre-show speech to deafening screams of encouragement from the audience which caused both her and I to get emotional. But this was just the beginning.</p>
<p>The ensemble really brought their all for this last show. I could see (even from all the way up in my light booth seat!) that they were truly relishing in it, enjoying every line, every moment, and every audience reaction, as this was the last time they would ever get to share these stories and touch these people through this show. It was one of the most special experiences I could ever have imagined having sitting and watching these wonderful people say these words for the last time.</p>
<p><a href="http://sedehidiversityproject.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2017/09/002.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-421 " src="http://sedehidiversityproject.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2017/09/002-e1505698879419-300x169.jpg" alt="" width="412" height="232" srcset="http://sedehidiversityproject.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2017/09/002-e1505698879419-300x169.jpg 300w, http://sedehidiversityproject.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2017/09/002-e1505698879419-1024x577.jpg 1024w, http://sedehidiversityproject.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2017/09/002-e1505698879419-624x352.jpg 624w, http://sedehidiversityproject.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2017/09/002-e1505698879419-768x433.jpg 768w, http://sedehidiversityproject.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2017/09/002-e1505698879419.jpg 1136w" sizes="(max-width: 412px) 100vw, 412px" /></a></p>
<p>Once we reached the part at the end of the show where the ensemble relays advice to the freshmen audience members, I fully lost it. I began quietly sobbing up on the catwalk out of overwhelming pride for the magic we created together. I was sad that it was ending right before my eyes, of course, but I was also so happy for the ensemble members who worked so hard and did so well.  I was grateful for this opportunity, for these people, for this knowledge I was walking away with. I was filled with so, so much love. The show came to an end and when I hit the last light cue, the audience once again erupted. The ensemble received a well-deserved standing ovation, and made me cry even harder when they gestured up to me during their final bows. I will never, ever experience something like this in my life again, and I can&#8217;t thank those other 8 project creators enough.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to forget about all the work that went into this project in the following weeks, because the morning after our final show was the day that classes began. And as we all know, once classes begin the year seems to go by in an instant. We&#8217;re all suddenly sitting in our seats on the lawn for graduation accepting our diplomas or cheering on our friends and questioning how we got here so fast. But something I&#8217;ve been trying to remind myself over these past couple weeks is that SDP 2017 is something that DID happen. It was real, however magical and fictional it may actually have felt like. It didn&#8217;t fix the world by any means, but it did change it. It began conversations, explanations, friendships, communities, understanding, acceptance. It gave a voice to so many unheard members of our Muhlenberg family. It gave ME a new family to call my own, and all of those things deserve to be remembered and cherished for years to come.</p>

<p>This is the last blog post I&#8217;ll be writing as the Sedehi Diversity Project manager, so to my readers, I say thank you! Thanks for coming on this journey with us and supporting us along the way. To Troy, I say thank you. You are one of the most brilliant, magnificent people I have ever had the pleasure of working with and I hope to do so again in the near future. And finally, to my SDP family I say, thank you. You will never know how much you did for me over this summer. You have my whole heart. Thank you, thank you, thank you.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s it, folks! I wish next year&#8217;s ensemble the BEST of luck. You are going to have the time of your lives through all the hard work, I promise. Document every moment whether that be pictures, videos, blog posts, or snapshots in your memory because you&#8217;re not going to want to miss a thing. All my love to you, future creators. I&#8217;m already jealous.</p>
<p>I leave you with the little footage I managed to take during the last week of the process. I was really trying to take it all in once I realized it was slowly slipping away, so I didn&#8217;t pick up my camera as much as I wanted to. Still some fun memories captured though, so make sure to check it out.</p>
<p>Thanks again to everyone. Here&#8217;s to &#8220;A Seat At the Table.&#8221;</p>
<p>xo</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello, all!</p>
<p>I write this to you having just completed a long, tiresome, stressful day of tech rehearsals, cue to cues, and show runs. But, even though I&#8217;m exhausted, anxious for the shows to come this week, and sad that it will soon all be over, I am also exhilarated by the incredible progress we made today, proud of all of us for the hard work we&#8217;ve been putting into this project we love so much, and excited to share it with some fresh eyes and ears at tomorrow&#8217;s open dress rehearsal.</p>
<p>We are approaching week 5 which is going to be many more tech rehearsals and then performances for the post-show facilitators, campus safety, ORS, RAs and SAs, student athletes, the administration, family and friends, and most importantly, the class of 2021. While there is so much in store, we also had a jam packed week 4, which started with a lovely evening out at the home of none other than our faculty adviser, Troy.</p>
<p>To release the stress of week 3 and revitalize for week 4, Troy invited us to his home to have dinner (which was absolutely phenomenal, if anyone was wondering), talk with some other faculty members, go swimming in his backyard pool, and share in each other&#8217;s company. We had the best time! Highlights include water gun fights and whirlpools while swimming, cookie cake made by Troy&#8217;s husband, raspberries with Wonder Woman themed toothpicks for easy snacking, spotting a skunk in the backyard, and laughing for hours on end. We love ya, Troy! Thank you so much for having us.</p>

<p>The week to follow was a lot and I mean a LOT of blocking. The thing I&#8217;m learning about SDP is that when you think you have a final script, you don&#8217;t (we&#8217;re still making script edits the week of performances). When you think you have the entire show blocked, you don&#8217;t. When you think you&#8217;ve solved all the problems, you absolutely have not. Moral of the story: SDP never sleeps, is never finished, and will, honestly, never be perfect. But we sure are trying our best to effectively share these stories with the world and I can whole hardheartedly say that I am so proud of the production we&#8217;ve created.</p>

<p>Troy helped us a lot this week by attending rehearsals and giving his feedback, helping us cut down the script, and giving us encouragement and inspiration. By the end of the week, we had finally reached a 19 page script that ran 34 minutes long and we were over the moon! This was one of the best moments of the week, tacked onto the list of other great moments such as the cast bonding night we had on Tuesday, yet another late night trip to Applebee&#8217;s, getting to move into our permanent fall housing (through much blood, sweat, and tears&#8230;.literally), and many intense games of zip zap zop. I find more things to love about these people every single day, and I am constantly grateful for this project for bringing us together.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s actually happening!! We technically open tomorrow with our open dress and then by Wednesday, we&#8217;re in business! I can&#8217;t believe we&#8217;re already here (but more importantly, I can&#8217;t believe classes and AUDITIONS start in a week!!!! But that&#8217;s for another time&#8230;). Make sure to check out our week 4 vlog below, read the ensemble members&#8217; reflective blog posts, and come back next week to see how our final week on the project went. That&#8217;s all for now, thanks for reading and I&#8217;ll see you soon! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi all!</p>
<p>Mik again. Here&#8217;s your weekly update (only a few days late&#8230;) on the 2017 SDP process!</p>
<p>Week Three: August 5th-August 11th, 2017</p>
<p>So, for anyone that doesn&#8217;t know, our rehearsal schedule this summer has typically been rehearsal Friday-Sunday from 6PM-10(ish)PM with Saturdays off. This has been great for our ensemble friends that have day jobs, and our other friends (((me))) who like to sleep the day away. But is has been especially good for day trips to the city, having friends from home visit, or shopping afternoons in Allentown! We love the work we&#8217;re doing and the project we&#8217;re creating, but it is nice to have that break every week (and most times, we spend it hanging out together anyway!).</p>
<p>So after our day of revitalization from an intense two weeks of work, we dove into step five of the process: SNIPPING! For anyone that has Melina on Snapchat, you may have seen videos of some crazy eyed ensemble members turning their hands into scissors and saying &#8220;snip snip!!&#8221; over and over again. I promise, this does actually mean something more than we&#8217;ve lost our minds. As soon as we had our first draft of the script, we began editing and cutting it down more and more every day, &#8220;snipping&#8221; quotes that were out of place, irrelevant, or not as strong as some other quotes. So, we&#8217;ve become easily amused by the idea of snipping away at this script that never seems to shorten, so much so that we renamed Drew, &#8220;Drewseph Snipperhands.&#8221; Clever, we know.</p>
<p>Now, you&#8217;d think that after spending this week snipping and cutting and editing and shortening that we&#8217;d have a final, 35 minute script ready to go, right? Umm&#8230;.not quite.</p>
<p>While we do definitely have a shorter than 53 page script, it doesn&#8217;t quite read 35 minutes long yet which is all the time we have for this production. Additionally, after constantly speaking to our fearless faculty adviser Troy, we discovered that we were lacking certain perspectives and voices crucial to the story we&#8217;re telling. So, we decided to add some administration interviews during week three, which was great in terms of adding balance to the script, but not so great in terms of making the script shorter. Now we had all this extra wonderful content that we wanted to add, which meant we had to take some original stuff out. And ALSO, during all of this, Bree and I began blocking the more solidified sections of the script in the black box (see vlog!). So, week three was busy to say the least. We were snipping, editing, cutting, rearranging, interviewing, transcribing, blocking, assigning lines, and trying to stay awake through it all! Big shout out to those who work all day then come to 4 or 5 hour rehearsals at night while keeping a positive attitude!</p>

<p>As week 3 came to a close though, we had more fun memories to add to our collection. Some highlights include a Rita&#8217;s trip during Sunday&#8217;s rehearsal break, ordering Chinese for dinner in the MIDDLE of Monday&#8217;s rehearsal, another dinner provided by Robin Riley-Casey on Tuesday evening, a post-rehearsal WaWa trip on Wednesday, and of course, a rousing game of &#8220;Zip, Zap, Zop&#8221; as a warm up for Friday&#8217;s rehearsal.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s getting more and more real, my friends! We&#8217;ve got a shorter, more solidified script, lots of blocking done, and exciting plans for the next two weeks! Hope to see you again for next week&#8217;s post, but for now, thanks for reading and make sure to watch the week 3 vlog linked below! Also, make sure you keep checking the blogs as the other ensemble members will be sharing their reflective experiences with you all very very soon! That&#8217;s all for now, so as Asherde would say, &#8220;Chip chip cheerio!&#8221; <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello Blog Readers!</p>
<p>Welcome to the 2017 Sedehi Diversity Project blog! My name is Mikaela Esposito and I am this year&#8217;s project manager which basically means that I am here to welcome you on this journey with us, and update you on all of the exciting, tiring, life-changing things we are getting up to over here on campus. We have actually been back at Muhlenberg and hard at work for a little over two weeks now, so here&#8217;s a quick update of everything we have accomplished, discovered, experienced, stressed about, etc. over the past two weeks:</p>
<p>Week One: July 21st-July 28th, 2017</p>
<p>Now, I can&#8217;t speak for all the ensemble members here, but I know that I was extremely anxious to move in on July 21st for the rest of the summer (mainly because we would have to cook for ourselves in our Village suites and as the ensemble very well knows, I can barely make a good bowl of cereal!) because I knew how special and important this project is to not only all of us, but Muhlenberg College as well. We had and have pretty big shoes to fill as the project has always been phenomenal and groundbreaking in the past, so I was overwhelmingly nervous to start working on this year&#8217;s production. Additionally, most of us in the ensemble were acquaintances or just friendly with each other, hardly any of us best friends, and now we would be living together and working every night on something so controversial and opinionated and personal! Needless to say, I was scared. Excited, but scared. However, as move in day began and we helped each other move all of our stuff into the dorm buildings (through a lot of sweat, I might add) I could tell that this summer was going to be great. There&#8217;s something about carrying boxes and bags and hampers and furniture in together that bonds a group of people, you know?</p>
<p>We decided that we were going to start rehearsal the night after we moved in so that we could dedicate that first night to being with each other and bonding as an ensemble, as the work we had ahead was going to require us being very comfortable and open with each other. So, of course, we ordered Chinese takeout and stayed up until the late hours of the morning chatting in the downstairs suite about Muhlenberg, our experiences, and how we were feeling about starting this project. I soon found out I wasn&#8217;t the only one to have some nerves, but that collectively, we were all so pumped to be here and working on something that means so much to all of us.</p>
<p>The next day we began our rehearsal process. Throughout the summer we had been doing our interviews with the students who had volunteered (as project manager let me tell you, organizing interviews with Muhlenberg students who have crazy busy schedules was a FEAT and on more than one occasion I thought this project was going to kill me&#8230;but I&#8217;m not dramatic!) and Bree B., being the amazing director that she is, required us to have our transcriptions of the interviews finished before our first rehearsal so we could get right to work. The first step of the process was interviews so&#8230;check. Next step? Transcribing the interviews&#8230;check. Step three: picking quotes from the transcriptions as an ensemble; quotes we think are interesting, important, and relevant for the story we are trying to tell with this project. This part of the process was time consuming, repetitive, and definitely got a bit silly at times, particularly with how late our rehearsals went. As Bree O. would say, &#8220;Welcome to SDP After Dark.&#8221;</p>
<div id="attachment_362" style="width: 179px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://sedehidiversityproject.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2017/08/146.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-362" class="size-medium wp-image-362" src="http://sedehidiversityproject.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2017/08/146-169x300.jpg" alt="" width="169" height="300" srcset="http://sedehidiversityproject.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2017/08/146-169x300.jpg 169w, http://sedehidiversityproject.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2017/08/146-576x1024.jpg 576w, http://sedehidiversityproject.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2017/08/146-624x1110.jpg 624w, http://sedehidiversityproject.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2017/08/146.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 169px) 100vw, 169px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-362" class="wp-caption-text">After one of our first rehearsals, hanging out in the upstairs suite together!</p></div>
<p>Throughout this week, our time mostly consisted of going through our transcriptions and finding quotes, doing some last minute interviews, transcribing them, and then starting step four of the process: categorizing the quotes. Basically in order for the script to have a structure, we needed to categorize the quotes based on what they were talking about so we could organize the script by these different topics. This is the step before the actual script building process, which hold onto your hats, is coming in week two.</p>
<p>Even though we spent a lot of time working, we also spent a LOT of time having fun which for us means EATING. One thing I&#8217;ve learned about this ensemble (besides the fact that everyone is hilarious, incredibly bright, and kind, loving people) is that we all really appreciate some good food. Highlights include celebrating Bree O.&#8217;s 21st birthday with some ice cream cake, late night chocolate chip cookie baking in the upstairs suite, family dinner in the multi cultural center, and late night trips to Applebee&#8217;s for half priced appetizers!</p>

<p>Week Two: July 29th-August 4th, 2017</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still in denial that it&#8217;s August and we&#8217;re already 9 days in. Classes start in 3 weeks and I haven&#8217;t even thought about buying textbooks, waking up for morning classes, or managing my dining dollars yet. Time flies when you&#8217;re creating a production, am I right ladies?</p>
<p>Week two began with our very first work call with Paul Theisen in the blackbox theater which was super fun! We got to help the Wild cast take down their set and began discussing ideas towards what we were going to do with our own production. Everyone was incredibly kind and helpful to us, especially because some of us were very out of our element (I was asked to use a drill and I think the terrified look on my face was Drew&#8217;s very clear cue to take over for me). We had two more work calls after that setting up the lights and the risers, which were broken up quite nicely with impromptu McDonald&#8217;s lunches and Domino&#8217;s dinners bought for us generously by the one and only Robin Riley-Casey. The way to our hearts, friends, is definitely through food. Just putting that out there.</p>
<p>Our productive streak was absolutely not disrupted by our fun meals together, though. We went head first into step four of the process, categorizing and listening to Bree B.&#8217;s &#8220;ambiance music&#8221; as we did so. Step five followed quickly after with printing out the category sheets and cutting out each individual quote. The purpose of this is to move the quotes around within their own category to create a sort of conversation among them, so that when we combine the categories to make a script, it&#8217;s as if there are many conversations within one giant conversation about Muhlenberg. After many late nights, paper cuts, and sweat/tear stained script pieces we finally had an order, structure, and&#8230;.script! After we had it all typed up, it came to a whopping 53 pages and took over an hour to read. We&#8217;ve since done lots and lots and LOTS of editing, &#8220;snipping&#8221; away for hours, but all that fun stuff will be revealed in week three&#8217;s post <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<div id="attachment_368" style="width: 179px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://sedehidiversityproject.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2017/08/193.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-368" class="size-medium wp-image-368" src="http://sedehidiversityproject.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2017/08/193-169x300.jpg" alt="" width="169" height="300" srcset="http://sedehidiversityproject.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2017/08/193-169x300.jpg 169w, http://sedehidiversityproject.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2017/08/193-576x1024.jpg 576w, http://sedehidiversityproject.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2017/08/193-624x1110.jpg 624w, http://sedehidiversityproject.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2017/08/193.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 169px) 100vw, 169px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-368" class="wp-caption-text">Hidden beneath all the notebook paper and category folders was our rough draft of the script!

<p>Thanks for reading this BEAST of a post, everyone! Not only will you have an update waiting for you here from me each week, but the ensemble members and our director Bree B. will be visiting here as well and sharing their experiences with you! For now, I leave you with our first SDP Video Blog with footage from the first two weeks. It&#8217;s getting there, my friends. What a special time in life we&#8217;re experiencing together and what a wonderful project we get to share! Talk to you soon!</p>
