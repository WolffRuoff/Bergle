								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Halperin, S. (9 February 2011). Aerosmith sales up 250% since Steven Tyler became “American Idol” judge. Billboard. Retrieved from <a href="http://www.billboard.com/#/news/aerosmith-sales-up-250-since-steven-tyler-1005027192.story">http://www.billboard.com/#/news/aerosmith-sales-up-250-since-steven-tyler-1005027192.story</a></p>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://www.realtvcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/american-idol-new-judges-2010.jpg" alt="" width="220" height="166" />Call it the <em>American Idol</em> Effect: Sales of Aerosmith’s music have shot up 250% since front man Steven Tyler signed on as a judge for the show. All of the band’s previous albums saw triple-digit increases after the Jan. 19 premiere of the show, reversing a pattern of decline in sales of the band&#8217;s music.</p>
<p><span id="more-774"></span></p>
<p>The judges are certainly not the only ones in the sound recording industry to benefit from the show. In fact, the show is the culmination of every synergistic collaboration between the television and sound recording industries <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1wIXIFfrXI">since the Beatles played Ed Sullivan</a>. The label that lands the newly-crowned superstar can eliminate the heated board meeting where executives argue about which new artist to promote. The risk that this audience-tested artist will fail is next to nil, minimizing the label’s risk for that year. Meanwhile, Fox cashes in on the desperation of a thousand wannabe superstars—and America’s willingness to watch them. And three judges get an instant plug for their music careers. How many Generation Y kids knew about Paula Abdul before <em>American Idol</em> cast her as a foil to Simon Cowell (a former music industry executive)? Now Steven Tyler and his label are hoping for their turn to leech off the show’s success. So far, it appears to be working.</p>
<p>It’s hardly surprising that <em>American Idol</em> chose someone like Tyler for its new judge panel. He’s interesting—frizzy hair, weird clothes, raspy heavy-smoker voice—but also very mainstream and popular across demographics. He’s a celebrity with a track record of selling product both with and without Aerosmith, having made very successful appearances as a commentator on the MTV-VH1 feature shows. And crucially, he’s surprisingly nice. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA8nvJfvdTk">According to the Associated Press</a>, Fox apparently wants a “kinder” American Idol after Cowell’s departure, and hopes to focus on the human interest stories the network has decided its audience craves. Tyler—more Abdul than Cowell—fits into this target personality.</p>
<p>Tyler derives his own benefits from the relationship. His status as a creator skyrockets in two industries. The celebrity judges are key to the show’s success, and the show’s producers know it. Tyler and his fellow judges therefore have a definite say in how the show looks and sounds. It’s also likely that, <a href="http://www.realitytvworld.com/news/simon-cowell-confirms-world-got-talent-global-reality-project-11113.php">like Cowell</a>, Tyler will use the show as a springboard to land other television projects. Meanwhile, the show is one giant promotion for Aerosmith’s upcoming album, as Tyler receives the full fawning attention of the television industry’s facilitators in the entertainment news industry, TV guide, and many others. As a CD on a rack, they wouldn’t give him a second glance, but he becomes interesting by virtue of being on TV. All of <em>American Idol’s</em> reviews come right back to benefit the band and garner them new fans.</p>
<p>And, as always, a whole team of people are probably cashing paychecks for yet again serving as the linking pin between Tyler and TV. It seems everyone’s making money. Tyler and the band certainly hope the cash flow will continue coming their way after they release their new album.</p>
