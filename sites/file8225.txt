					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Great summary of the article. I do agree how Hanski tried to avoid trite words in his article and I do believe you captured that really well. These common words do not really get the point across as well as bigger and less common words. It can mean all the difference by just changing a couple words to make the article come alive. I do also believe how Hanski&#039;s word choice actually makes the reader want to read and enjoy reading too. Very good analysis of the article!&lt;/p&gt;
