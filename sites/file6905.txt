								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">More children are being diagnosed with mental health issues than ever before. The rates in which children are being diagnosed with bipolar spectrum disorder alone has risen exponentially in the past 20 years. What could be the cause? There are likely a multitude of factors to explain the increase. Some of these factors being improved recognition, better insurance coverage for major mental illnesses, decreased stigma, assignment when a diagnosis is ambiguous and a wider utilization of the medical model of Bipolar Spectrum Disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5th ed.Text Revision (Danner et al, 2009). Adults with the disorder have recurrent and cyclical mood episodes which varies from person to person. But in children the symptoms may initially look like depression or just typical behavior problems. Because over ⅓-½ of children that have the disorder have some psychotic symptoms it is often misdiagnosed as schizophrenia initially. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I</span><span style="font-weight: 400">n order to help students diagnosed with the disorder to reach their full potential there must be increased awareness among educators and community advocates. Training and education about behaviors that may show up in the classroom can reduce  stigma and negative interactions between pupil and teacher. It will increase empathy and may also help foster better parent/teacher relationships as well. All very important factors that will contribute to the academic and socio-emotional success of a child diagnosed with bipolar spectrum disorder. These children deserve no less.</span></p>
