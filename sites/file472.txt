The team consists of several\u00a0 individuals from each library department. However we created a design subcommittee (4 people, one from each department) so that design conversations were inclusive but the work could progress forward.<\/li><li>The web applications team participated in an initial brainstorm about \u201cwhat we wanted to accomplish with the new site.\u201d<\/li><li>By considering the needs of different types of patrons \u201cthe subcommittee came up with a couple of ideas for layouts, and engaged in a couple of rounds of feedback and editing.\u201d\u00a0 Layouts were shared with the full web team and then each department.<\/li><li>A design was chosen and each member of the library staff helped to organize and review content.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s a big site, and we\u2019ve come up with the plans of a maintenance schedule so that all the content is reviewed annually.\u201d<\/li><li>We completed one round of assessment with students.\u00a0 The assessment process (a series of tasks to be completed by the student) was reviewed by the Institutional Review B.\u00a0 Changes were made to the website if students consistently had trouble locating particular information.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What were the main changes to the site?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brittany and Nicholas described the changes they made to navigation, which was their first priority.&nbsp; They determined that about seven menu items is ideal for successful navigation in order to \u201cget patrons to where an item might be.\u201d&nbsp; They hope that if a patron can intuit where a piece of information would be based on headings then they would find it successfully. They altered site navigation design so that it resembled the design of other library platforms, including OCLC discovery and EBSCOhost databases, making navigation familiar and easier to use.&nbsp; Similarly, consistent use of color scheme helped to tie all library interfaces together.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How did you stay organized?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They used agendas, taking minutes during meetings, and spreadsheets of tasks that they checked off as they were completed.&nbsp; The hardest part? \u201cRemembering what decisions were made and why,\u201d Brittany said, \u201c\u2026we did struggle with that a bit.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The final result \u2013 and the future<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The website is visually appealing and ready for another round of user experience assessment, which will be completed later this year.&nbsp; You can take a closer look at the navigation and content by exploring&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http:\/\/trexler.muhlenberg.edu\/\" target=\"_blank\">trexler.muhlenberg.edu<\/a>.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img data-attachment-id=\"2630\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/trexlerworks.muhlenberg.edu\/trexler_blog\/news\/library-website-redesign-an-interview\/attachment\/new-website\/#main\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/trexlerworks.muhlenberg.edu\/trexler_blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/new-website.png?fit=1443%2C850\" data-orig-size=\"1443,850\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"new-website\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/trexlerworks.muhlenberg.edu\/trexler_blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/new-website.png?fit=300%2C177\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/trexlerworks.muhlenberg.edu\/trexler_blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/new-website.png?fit=829%2C488\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1443\" height=\"850\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/trexlerworks.muhlenberg.edu\/trexler_blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/new-website.png?fit=829%2C488&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2630\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/trexlerworks.muhlenberg.edu\/trexler_blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/new-website.png?w=1443 1443w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/trexlerworks.muhlenberg.edu\/trexler_blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/new-website.png?resize=300%2C177 300w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/trexlerworks.muhlenberg.edu\/trexler_blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/new-website.png?resize=768%2C452 768w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/trexlerworks.muhlenberg.edu\/trexler_blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/new-website.png?resize=1024%2C603 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 829px) 100vw, 829px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Brittany is currently thinking seriously about accessibility \u2013 and implementing the accessibility changes that she\u2019s already worked hard to design.&nbsp; She recommended consulting&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.w3.org\/WAI\/\">W3<\/a>&nbsp;for accessibility guidelines and noted that she does want to test the final result with a screen reader.&nbsp; She has worked hard to make sure that users of all abilities can navigate the site successfully with techniques such as shortcuts to skip navigation so that the entire menu isn\u2019t read before the user can move on to the main page content.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Advice for Others&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I asked them for advice they might give to others seeking to redesign their library website, Brittany and Nicholas emphasized flexibility and communication.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t get tied down to one idea\u201d \u2013 Nick<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cGet anyone who wants to come up with an idea to do it\u2013 but it is really hard to get people to come up with ideas.\u201d \u2013Brittany<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWhatever plan you set for the redesign process, chances are you\u2019ll have to modify it\/make it longer and there is nothing wrong about that.\u201d \u2013 Brittany<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cCreativity is a challenge\u201d \u2013 Nick<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And finally\u2026<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cHave a set date to go live.&nbsp; Otherwise projects tend to drag on endlessly. \u201c \u2013Brittany<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>By Jess Denke, Outreach &amp; Assessment Librarian; Social Sciences Subject SpecialistThis article was initially posted on Librarian Design Share, a blog dedicated to inspiring library creatives.
