								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>SoundCloud has become an underground music source for people around the world. It was established in Sweden by Swedish music artists as a collaborative tool. However, SoundCloud eventually developed into a mechanism of self promotion and distribution catered towards bands and vocalists. One of the main attributes that makes SoundCloud attractive to so many people is that it’s completely free to use the website. Money is a significant problem among music artists. The lack of fiscal stress enables people to explore and pursue their music careers freely and from an international platform. In addition to the cost effective nature of SoundCloud, its initial release in 2011 was simultaneous with the popularity of tablets and mobile browsing. Wikipedia states that in 2012, “the new SoundCloud version was released to the general public…The enhanced platform offered new features such as: redesigned profiles; more sharing options; real-time notifications…” (Wikipedia, 2015), etc. These enhanced visualizations and connectivity between SoundCloud’s users made the website and app initially less appealing to the public, but statistically gained higher ratings than ever before.</p>
<p>One of the most significant contributions to SoundCloud as a global company was the partnership with Twitter in 2013. Many people had doubts about the credibility of SoundCloud when, “talks with major music labels about licensing…did not amount to anything substantial”, for the, “negotiation process was initiated in an attempt to avoid the problems faced by Google” (Wikipedia, 2015) about copyrighted material. However, with Twitter’s newfound stake in the company, SoundCloud started to appear to the social media community as a company to be taken seriously. Through ads, royalty agreements, and participation between various music labels, artists, and specifically Warner Music, SoundCloud has been able to handle the conflict of copyright and has officially dominated the music scene throughout the world.</p>
<p>As a young vocalist, SoundCloud makes pursuing a career in music more easily attainable. It allows artists to have complete control over their work and easily spread it around the world. Its combined use of sharing throughout various social media sites, such as Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr, and Google Plus, makes self promotion and self-acclaimed fame possible and imaginable. It’s the American Dream want to start a business from scratch and make a fortune from it. This social media tool makes it possible for artists to do just that, and to do it themselves about something they’re passionate about.</p>
