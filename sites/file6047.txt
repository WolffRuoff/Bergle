			<p>The first few months of college can be difficult for incoming freshmen. They have to adjust to life without their parents; classes are more challenging; and of course there’s the dread of no longer having someone to do the laundry.</p>
<p>As if that’s not enough, the freshmen on the Muhlenberg field hockey and volleyball teams have also added “helping turn a team around” to their already long list of new responsibilities.</p>
<p>Both teams struggled through down seasons last fall but have shown great improvement this year. Field hockey has already won more games than all of last season, while volleyball has surpassed its Centennial Conference win total from a year ago with half of the conference season still to play.<a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/thies2.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-254" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/thies2.jpg" alt="" width="340" height="353" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/thies2.jpg 340w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/thies2-288x300.jpg 288w" sizes="(max-width: 340px) 100vw, 340px" /></a></p>
<p>And a big reason for both resurgences has been the play of freshmen.</p>
<p>For field hockey, freshmen have accounted for 10 of 16 goals, led by Kayleigh Thies <em>(right)</em> who is first on the team with seven goals and 17 points. She is also the top scoring freshman in the conference. Three other freshmen, Heather Porrini (two goals), Christine Germaske (one goal, one assist) and Allison Califano (one assist)  have also scored this fall, and keeper Sierra Lenker made six saves to get the win in her first career start against Widener.</p>
<p>But more than just stats, the newcomers have helped change the mentality of the team, according to junior Kristen Dornenburg.</p>
<p>The difference was evident from the first day of practice, she said, adding the 14-member freshman class brought a strong sense of aggressiveness that has pushed older players for their starting spots. The result has been a team that plays with more fire both during practice and in games.</p>
<p>“You could tell we were a lot more competitive going against each other when preseason started,” Dornenburg said. “We’re all fighting for positions every day in practice, and if we’re not competitive, we’re not going to play. So I think that’s what you see the freshmen have brought. Everyone has to fight for their position, and that’s raised our level as a team.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/hynson2.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-255" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/hynson2.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="497" /></a>For volleyball, five rookies see regular time. Alyssa Schell leads the team with 170 digs, while Nikki Dickson is tied for the lead with 21 aces and is second with 172 assists. Holly Hynson <em>(left)</em> ranks third on the squad with 96 kills, and Julia Elkin (80 digs, nine aces) and Lindsey Gambocurta (50 kills, nine aces) have also been solid contributors.</p>
<p>The youthful influx has also given some of the veteran players a chance to play their normal positions, which didn’t always happen last fall when the Mules were hampered by injuries and forced to move players around in order to field a full lineup.</p>
<p>“Instead of trying to have everyone play somewhere just so we can have six people on the court, there’s people specialized in every spot playing their natural positions,” senior Brooke McQueen said. “Now that we have people with the talent at the right spots the court, we’re a lot more comfortable and playing a lot better. That has been one of the big differences this year.”</p>
<p>The freshmen have also been welcomed additions outside of games and practices, as well. Volleyball senior Jackie Price said the team has the feel of a family, with the three seniors taking the freshmen under their wings.</p>
<p>But at the same time, the newcomers have brought a sense of fun to the team, which includes plenty of singing, dancing and joking on the way to and from games, and at dinner after practice.</p>
<p>And the way this season has gone, there may be even more wins for both teams to sing and dance about before the year is done.</p>
<p>“They’re just as goofy and crazy as the rest of us,” Price said with a laugh. “We’re welcoming them with open arms, and they’ve seriously made a great impact on our team this year.</p>
<p>“We’re working so well together; everyone knows their role. They have been a great addition to the team, and I am just so proud of them all.”</p>

<p>Something that hadn&#8217;t happened since the very first game the Muhlenberg women&#8217;s soccer team played.</p>
<p>Mule goalie Michele Toher made 10 saves &#8211; including two spectacular diving stops late in regulation and early in overtime &#8211; against the regionally ranked Royals. It was the most saves by a Muhlenberg goalie in a scoreless tie since 1991, when Jen Samble made 29 against Swarthmore in the program&#8217;s first game as a varsity sport.</p>
<p>(Incidentally, Samble was on campus last weekend as a member of the 1991 softball team that got inducted into the Muhlenberg College Athletics Hall of Fame.)</p>
<p>There have been only nine scoreless ties in the program&#8217;s 21-year history. Here are the save totals from each of those games:</p>
<ul>
<li>1991 vs. Swarthmore &#8211; 29 (Jen Samble)</li>
<li>1995 vs. Beaver &#8211; 6 (Jackie Vanderstreet)</li>
<li>2003 vs. Moravian &#8211; 4 (Kayla Boisvert)</li>
<li>2004 vs. Moravian &#8211; 5 (Stacey Spector)</li>
<li>2005 vs. Scranton &#8211; 7 (Kayla Boisvert)</li>
<li>2008 vs. Moravian &#8211; 2 (Kate Morrissey)</li>
<li>2008 vs. Gettysburg &#8211; 4 (Michele Toher)</li>
<li>2010 vs. St. Joseph&#8217;s &#8211; 2 (Michele Toher)</li>
<li>2011 vs. Scranton &#8211; 10 (Michele Toher)</li>
</ul>
<p>Scoreless ties generally fall into two categories: closely played games with low shot totals or games in which one team has a huge advantage in shots but just can&#8217;t put one in. Most of the Mules&#8217; 0-0 draws have been of the first variety.</p>
<p>Toher&#8217;s 10 saves also were the most by a Muhlenberg goalie in a shutout effort since Stacey Spector made 11 against Dickinson in 2004. Those are the only two cases of a Mule keeper reaching double digits in saves in a shutout since 2000.</p>
<p>Although Toher didn&#8217;t match Samble&#8217;s save total, she did pass her on the program&#8217;s career list with her 17th shutout. Toher ranks third all-time.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s something.</p>

			<p><em>The Student-Athlete Advisory Committee (SAAC) was adopted by the NCAA in 1989, formed primarily to review and offer student-athlete input on NCAA activities and proposed legislation that affect student-athlete welfare. NCAA legislation mandates that all member institutions have SAACs on their respective campuses. Last weekend, junior Kate Clawson (basketball) and senior Nick Busillo (baseball) represented Muhlenberg at the Centennial Conference SAAC Leadership Retreat. Here&#8217;s what they wrote about their experience:</em></p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/clawsonhs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-241" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/clawsonhs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>(KC) The SAAC retreat was held at the Wyndham Hotel in Harrisburg, Pa., and was attended by 20 student-athletes, about two from each school. On Friday, when we arrived we met Keith Waldman, from OPA, who does team building with teams all over the nation. First, he led us through some team building activities to better get to know each other. All the athletes were very welcoming, as was Renee Fraker, the director of championships in our conference who put the retreat together.</p>
<p>(NB) There were two baseball players from Ursinus at the conference. It was funny because of course my natural instinct was to not like these kids, but they were both nice kids. Jokes and predictions were made, and that made things interesting, but all in all they were great kids and it was a great experience.</p>
<p>(KC) I really enjoyed the team building activities because each of them taught us things we <a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/saac_clawson.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-245" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/saac_clawson.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="306" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/saac_clawson.jpg 400w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/saac_clawson-300x229.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/saac_clawson-392x300.jpg 392w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></a>could apply to accomplishing team goals, staying positive, learning from our mistakes and becoming better leaders. This was definitely one of my favorite parts of the trip. We also brought along our resumes for the professional development portion of the weekend where we talked about the importance of networking and interview tips, which were very beneficial for everyone.</p>
<p>On Saturday we talked about issues that athletes face on campus and problem solving for each of the issues. Everyone shared their ideas, which were very helpful, and it was cool to see what each school had to say.</p>
<p><em></em><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/busillohs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-242" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/busillohs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>(NB) One common issue that I noticed was the balancing of sports and academics. Although presently we are not fans of the workload, we all recognized that in the long run this will all be beneficial for us. We all recognized that we are students first and that it comes with being a student-athlete.</p>
<p>(KC) Next we went over the proposals for new NCAA legislation. This was really important because it gave us as student-athletes a say in what regulations were being passed. We got to offer our opinions and knew that they were actually going to matter.</p>
<p>At the end of a long day on Saturday we met with members from the Special Olympics, had a pizza party and played bocce with them. We definitely had a thing or two to learn about bocce as we saw that the Special Olympics athletes weren&#8217;t taking it easy on us. I think we all got beat that day, but it was still really fun to hang out with them and learn from them. I think it taught us how determined the athletes of Special Olympics are, and it was <a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/saac_busillo.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-246" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/saac_busillo.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="301" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/saac_busillo.jpg 450w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/saac_busillo-300x200.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/saac_busillo-448x300.jpg 448w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a>pretty inspirational to hear some of their stories, one woman who got to go to China for the Olympics and had been a member since the 1970s.</p>
<p>Overall, I had a great weekend, met really influential people, and learned a lot that I can take back to the SAAC group as well as to Muhlenberg athletics as a whole.</p>
<p>(NB) During discussions I learned of all the fundraising activities that other schools are doing. I know Muhlenberg does their part in fundraising, but these schools had some great ideas that would not be bad thing for Muhlenberg to take a look into.</p>

			<p><em>Muhlenberg&#8217;s athletes of the week for contests between September 26 and October 2</em></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/thieshs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-236" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/thieshs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Female Athlete of the Week &#8211; Kayleigh Thies, Field Hockey</strong></p>
<div>Thies contributed to six of seven goals, with three goals and three assists, as Muhlenberg won back-to-back games against Widener and Dickinson. She had two goals and an assist vs. Widener and a goal and two assists vs. Dickinson. Thies has been involved in eight of the Mules&#8217; 12 goals this season, and her 13 points are tied for the second-most by a &#8216;Berg freshman in the last 20 years.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/fiorillohs.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-237" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/fiorillohs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Male Athlete of the Week &#8211; Mike Fiorillo, Football</strong></div>
<div> </div>
<div>Fiorillo, also named Centennial Conference defensive player of the week, made a team-high nine tackles, one for loss, and recorded the first two interceptions of his career in a 30-14 win against Susquehanna. He picked off a pass on the Crusaders’ first play from scrimmage and halted a fourth-quarter drive into Muhlenberg territory with his second pick. Fiorillo led a defense that held Susquehanna to 14 points and 222 yards, well below their averages of 29.0 and 380.5 coming into the game.</div>

			<p>Is it October already? Indeed it is, and the Mules teams begin the second half of their 2011 seasons on a weekend filled with home events.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-104" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="237" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg 350w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1-300x203.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" /></a>Volleyball vs. Dickinson (Saturday, 11:00)</strong></p>
<p>The Mules dig playing at home. In their last four matches at Memorial Hall, they defeated Albright and McDaniel and were very competitive with strong Moravian and Haverford teams. Now they’ll try to even their Centennial Conference record against 2-10 Dickinson.</p>
<p>The Mules also dig pediatric cancer research. Muhlenberg volleyball and the Centennial Conference are working together this year to raise money for Tanner&#8217;s Touch, a non-profit organization out of Westminster, Md., that raises awareness and funds to support pediatric cancer research. The Mules (who also play Mount St. Mary at 3:00) will collect pledges and donations for every dig they record in the match against Dickinson.</p>

<p><strong>Field Hockey vs. Dickinson (Friday, 7:00)</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg will try to make it two wins in a row and capture its first Centennial Conference win of the season. Dickinson is also 0-3 in the CC.</p>

<p>The Mules compete in one of the largest meets in the nation as they continue to prepare for the Centennial championship meet.</p>

<p><strong>Football vs. Susquehanna (Saturday, 1:00)</strong></p>
<p>Susquehanna (3-1) makes its first trip to Allentown since 1992 having won its three games by a combined six points, all on the final play of the game. The loss was at Johns Hopkins, 56-7. The 2-2 Mules, looking to bounce back from a 27-17 loss at Hopkins last week, will try to take advantage of a Crusader defense that has allowed 450.0 yards and 39.8 points per game.</p>

<p><strong>Women’s Soccer vs. Dickinson (Saturday, 4:00)</strong></p>
<p>Dickinson won the CC regular-season title and advanced to the “Sweet 16” of the NCAA Tournament last year but is just 1-2 in the CC to start this season. Muhlenberg (1-1-1) is looking to bounce back from an 0-2 weekend in Maryland.</p>
<p><strong>Men’s Soccer vs. Haverford (Saturday, 7:00)</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg (5-2, 1-2) is happy to be home after tough road trips to Johns Hopkins and Swarthmore, both of which resulted in one-goal losses. Haverford is 0-3 in the CC, with all three losses by a single goal, and also lost just 1-0 to top-ranked Messiah.</p>

			<p><em>Last Friday, 45 Muhlenberg College students presented at the Science Summer Research Poster Session, a culmination of their summer work. Each on-campus summer science research student was awarded an 8-10 week stipend supported by either internal College grants, some external funding or generous alumni.</em></p>
<p><em>Among those presenting were five athletes.  We asked them about their research projects and life as a student-athlete.</em></p>
<p><strong>Michael Baer, Track &amp; Field</strong> (A Possible Role for nhr-239 in Sensory Response)</p>
<p><em><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/baer.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-220" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/baer.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="287" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/baer.jpg 500w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/baer-300x172.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a>Describe your research project.</em> I study feeding behavior in the nematode C. elegans. Specifically, I am working on uncovering the function of a poorly studied gene, nhr-239, because when we delete this gene the nematodes show a different feeding pattern. Right now we think that this change has to do with oxygen sensation.</p>
<p><em>Why did you choose this topic? </em>I originally joined Dr. Wightman&#8217;s lab because genetics is a field of study that I find very interesting and may continue to study in the future. I enjoy my topic because of all the unknowns present. Our lab is the first to work on the function of nhr-239.</p>
<p><em>What did it mean to you to be named an Academic All-American last year? </em>Being named an Academic All-American last year was a great honor, especially since athletics and academics are the largest parts of my life at Muhlenberg. I&#8217;ve always viewed myself as a student-athlete, which made this award such an honor for me.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki Cronin and Nate Crossette, Cross Country/Track &amp; Field</strong> (Calibrations for High Energy Physics)</p>
<p><em><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/crossette.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-221" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/crossette.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="310" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/crossette.jpg 490w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/crossette-300x189.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/crossette-474x300.jpg 474w" sizes="(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px" /></a>Describe your research project.</em> (NIcki) We were studying the properties of the quark gluon plasma, which was created from the collisions of gold nuclei. This interests us because it recreates the conditions microseconds after the big bang and we are interested studying these properties of the early universe. Specifically, we worked with a detector called the Muon Piston Calorimeter and calibrating its response to the photons it detected from the pi zero decays.</p>
<p>(Nate) The Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), a particle collider in Long Island, is powerful enough to create a quark gluon plasma, the hottest known matter in the universe, when it smashes gold nuclei together at great enough speeds. Detectors surrounding the collision make measurements by detecting particles that were created when the plasma cools and expands. My contribution to the research collaboration at RHIC was to help calibrate the Muon Piston Calorimeter, a subsystem of a detector, using computer simulations and collision data.</p>
<p><em>Why did you choose this topic?</em> (Nate) I chose this research because when asked what I want to do with physics, I don’t have an answer. I want to find an answer to that question. My favorite part of this experience was learning how to write computer code that models physical phenomena.</p>
<p><em>What did you enjoy most about it? </em>(Nicki) This was an area of physics that I had never explored before and I truly learned a lot in the process about nuclear and particle physics as well as computer programming. It was an amazing and unique experience to not only be able to work with other students from Muhlenberg, but with physicists from around the world who have been doing research like this for years.</p>
<p><em>Do you take more pride in your athletic achievements or your academic achievements?</em> (Nicki) Personally, I take more pride in my academic achievements. Athletics is a good addition in my life, I love running with my team and it helps keep me balanced, but ultimately, it is my academics that is going to take me where I want to be in life. For me, academics is the number one priority.</p>
<p><em>Is it more challenging to understand physics or run an 8K in the mud?</em> (Nate) Understanding physics and running an 8k through the mud are both fun, yet challenging in opposite ways. Running is simple, so it’s very easy to overcomplicate. During a race, the challenge is to focus on telling your body to relax and run faster, even when you are very tired. Physics is really complicated, so the challenge is thinking of scenarios that demonstrate physics principles in a way that makes it easy to understand while not oversimplifying. I don’t think I could pick which one is harder. I enjoy both.</p>
<p><strong>Melissa Ugelow, Cross Country/Track &amp; Field</strong> (Tailoring Porous Silicon for Analyte Response)</p>
<p><em><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/ugelow.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-222" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/ugelow.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="321" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/ugelow.jpg 500w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/ugelow-300x192.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/ugelow-467x300.jpg 467w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a>Describe your research project.</em> My research this summer focused on assessing and characterizing porous silicon and its sensing properties. The ultimate goal of the project is to be able to tailor the surface of porous silicon for analyte response.  </p>
<p><em>What did you enjoy most about it?</em> What I enjoyed the most about this topic was that it was so new to me.  I was able to learn so many new analytical techniques and use new instruments.  </p>
<div><em>How do you balance being a year-round athlete with being a chemistry major?</em> Sometimes it is hard to balance being a chemistry major with sports all year round but I have been very lucky that all of my professors have been very understanding and helpful. All the chemistry professors leave their office doors open and want you to ask them questions if you need help. Sometimes it is difficult to balance the workload with the practice and meet schedule, but I think that if I did not run, I would not be as focused and motivated as I am now.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>Erica Wenzel, Volleyball/Softball</strong> (POGIL Patterns: Indentifying &amp; Documenting Effective Elements &amp; Practices)</div>
<div> </div>
<div><em><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/wenzel.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-223" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/wenzel.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="330" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/wenzel.jpg 500w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/wenzel-300x198.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/wenzel-454x300.jpg 454w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a>Describe your research project. </em>Over the summer, I worked with Dr. Kussmaul on researching patterns in POGIL (process oriented guided inquiry learning) activities. I analyzed the questions of the activities to determine what types of questions followed each other and then created another set of patterns, which would be used in future research.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><em>What did you enjoy most about it?</em> I am extremely grateful to get this experience. The part I liked the most was learning about POGIL and how to implement it in the classroom.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><em>What are some of the qualities you learn as an athlete that help you as a student? </em>Two important qualities I learned through athletics are time management and responsibility. As an athlete, you need to manage homework, studying, practices and games. It&#8217;s not always easy, but its important to stay on top of school as well as sports. Being on a team is a big responsibility. You have to look out for your teammates, make sure everything is ready for practice/games, and you need to take responsibility for your schoolwork if you are missing class due to a game as well.  Both of these qualities will be extremely helpful after college.</div>

			<p>One of the most popular movies in the United States has a Muhlenberg connection.</p>
<p><em>Moneyball</em>, starring Brad Pitt, is the story of Billy Beane&#8217;s doings as general manager of <a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/215px-Moneyball_Poster.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-212" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/215px-Moneyball_Poster.jpg" alt="" width="215" height="319" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/215px-Moneyball_Poster.jpg 215w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/215px-Moneyball_Poster-202x300.jpg 202w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /></a>the Oakland A&#8217;s in 2002. It opened last weekend to critical acclaim and finished at No. 2 at the box office, behind only <em>The Lion King 3D</em>.</p>
<p>Former Mule baseball coach Bob Macaluso has a small part in the movie hitting fungoes to Scott Hatteberg (played by Chris Pratt).</p>
<p>&#8220;A friend of mine was hired by Sony Pictures to gather former players and coaches to try out for parts in the movie in the summer of 2010,&#8221; Macaluso wrote in an e-mail. &#8220;Most of the movie was shot in Oakland; my scene was at Long Beach. They selected a scene of me hitting ground balls to Hatteberg and got a couple of closeup shots of me on the big screen.&#8221; </p>
<p>Macaluso, billed as &#8220;Coach Bob&#8221; in the movie credits, coached Muhlenberg from 1999 to <a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/macaluso4.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-213" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/macaluso4-156x300.jpg" alt="" width="156" height="300" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/macaluso4-156x300.jpg 156w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/macaluso4.jpg 248w" sizes="(max-width: 156px) 100vw, 156px" /></a>2006 and ranks second on the program&#8217;s all-time wins list with a record of 136-146-3. He led the Mules to the Centennial Conference finals in 2002 and 2003.</p>
<p>When he&#8217;s not working on his movie career, Macaluso is in his fifth year as an assistant coach at Cal-Irvine. He coaches first base for the Anteaters, who have been to the NCAA Regionals each of the last four years.</p>
<p>So how has Macaluso&#8217;s big screen debut been received? &#8220;I have received positive reviews of my Academy Award performance!&#8221; he wrote.</p>
