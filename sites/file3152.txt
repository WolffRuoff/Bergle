								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So Greek life at Muhlenberg is definitely present, but doesn&#8217;t dominate the social scene by any means.  My sophomore year a lot of my friends decided to join Greek Life and they have absolutely loved it, but at the time it wasn&#8217;t the right thing for me.  Now, usually there is only Fall rush and pledging so most students join in the Fall of their sophomore year.  However, this year one of the sororities was doing Spring rush and I decided to do it!</p>
<p>I am currently pledging Delta Zeta and am absolutely LOVING it.  I am in a rather small pledge class with only five of us, but the girls are all so unbelievably sweet and I am really enjoying myself.  One thing that really attracted me to DZ is the fact that most of, if not all, of the girls do so many other things on campus besides Delta Zeta.  This was perfect for me because it means that I can keep my life here and continue to be involved in lots of different things AND do Greek Life.</p>
<p>About 20% of Muhlenberg&#8217;s campus is involved with Greek Life and there are a ton of organizations to be a part of.  I actually was technically a part of Greek Life before this semester because I am a brother of Alpha Phi Omega which is the co-ed community service fraternity on campus.  There is also Kappa Kappa Psi which is our music fraternity on campus, and Theta Nu Xi which is the multi-cultural sorority.  This is all in addition to the four social sororities and three fraternities that we have on campus.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m really glad that I have to opportunity to be a part of something that I had written off as a possibility because I didn&#8217;t know what I wanted as  sophomore.  I love being a part of another group on campus and meeting all types of different people.</p>
<p>Until next time,</p>
<p>Ciao</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello Hello Hello!!!!</p>
<p>I know, I know, I have been majorly slacking when it comes to the posting of blogs BUT have no fear, I&#8217;m back, and with so much to tell!!</p>
<p>So since we last talked I have officially started my second semester of my Junior year back on Berg&#8217;s campus.  It has been so nice to see everyone and get back into my routine of work and classes.  That being said, it&#8217;s also been a little overwhelming.</p>
<p>Right away I was back in the thick of it with rehearsals for <em>Street Scene</em> starting the Sunday before classes, taking four classes on the first Monday, and joining a sorority on campus the following week.  I would say I have bitten off a little more than I can chew, but so far I&#8217;m surviving.  The nice thing is, yes, I am busy, but I absolutely LOVE everything that I am doing!</p>
<p>I know I talked about my anxiety regarding coming back to Berg, and yes I still am adjusting but so far it&#8217;s been ok.  I love the classes I am taking and it&#8217;s been really nice to see all of my friends and catch up.  I think I still need some time to digest that yes, I went abroad and it was amazing, and now I am back, but I think everything will work out.</p>
<p>I promise, promise, promise, to keep up with blogs from now on!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Until next time,</p>
<p>Ciao</p>
