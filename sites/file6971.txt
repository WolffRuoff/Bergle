								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>An overview of child maltreatment:</strong> This week in class we discussed child maltreatment, including abuse and neglect. The Center for Disease Control (CDC) defines child abuse and neglect as “any act or series of acts of commission or omission by a parent or other caregiver (e.g., clergy, coach, teacher) that results in harm, potential for harm, or threat of harm to a child.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Acts of Commission (Abuse):</strong> The CDC defines acts of abuse as “words or overt actions that cause harm, potential harm, or threat of harm. Acts of commission are deliberate and intentional.” It is important to note the wording of this definition. In regard to <em>intention</em>: intention only applies to the actions of the caregiver, and not the consequences of the actions. For example: a parent hits a child as a form of punishment (the action of hitting is <em>intentional</em> and not accidental), but the hitting is not intended to cause the child to have a black eye.</p>
<p><strong>Types of Abuse: </strong></p>
<p>Physical Abuse– e.g., hitting, punching</p>
<p>Sexual Abuse– e.g., inappropriate touching, groping, non-consensual sexual actions</p>
<p>Psychological Abuse– e.g., abuse that can cause emotional harm, such as verbal threats</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Acts of Omission (Neglect):</strong> The CDC defines child neglect as the “failure to provide needs or to protect from harm or potential harm.” Similar to acts of commission, actual harm to the child may not be the intended consequence.</p>
<p><strong>Types of Neglect: </strong></p>
<p><strong>Failure to Provide:</strong></p>
<p>Physical Neglect – e.g., not giving the child enough food, appropriate clothing</p>
<p>Emotional Neglect – e.g., not providing the child with adequate love, attention, and affection</p>
<p>Medical/ Dental Neglect – e.g., failure to bring the child to the doctor when sick, not bringing the child in for regular shots or check-ups</p>
<p>Educational Neglect – e.g., not providing necessary tools to complete school work such as pencils, preventing child from attending school</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Failure to Supervise:</strong></p>
<p>Inadequate Supervision – e.g., leaving a child alone in a hot car, leaving a child alone for too long</p>
<p>Exposure to Violent Environments – e.g., child is privy to domestic violence, organized crime</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In 2016, there were 676,000 victims of child abuse and neglected that were <em>reported </em>to Child Protective Services (CPS)</li>
<li>80% of the perpetrators of the abuse were parents</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How you can help:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Mandated Reporters: individuals, by law, that must report any <em>suspicion</em> of child abuse/neglect to CPS. A mandated reporter is any individual that provides care to a child. Mandated Reporter Laws vary from state to state (see link below).</li>
<li>Even if you are not a mandated reporter, it is important to report any suspicion of potential child abuse/neglect. Remember, when you report something, you are not responsible for investigating the case, therefore, the responsibility leaves your hands once you make a report.</li>
<li>Call <strong>911</strong> if you believe the child is in immediate danger.</li>
<li>For non-emergency situations, call the Child Abuse Hotline, ChildLine at: <strong>1-800-932-0313</strong></li>
</ul>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Child maltreatment can be defined as the intentional or reckless doing of any physical, emotional, or mental harm to a child. Examples of child maltreatment include, but are not limited to: bodily injury, serious physical neglect of a child, fabricating or the intentionally exaggerating of a medical symptom or disease, sexual abuse or exploitation of a child, etc. In Pennsylvania, the Child Protective Services Law was passed to protect children from abuse, allow the opportunity for healthy growth and development, as well as preserve and stabilize the family. The abuse is considered recent if it happened within a two-year range of when the report is made to ChildLine, however, there is no time limit for sexual abuse, serious mental injury, serious physical neglect and deaths. A few examples of people who can be considered perpetrators of child abuse are: a parent, a person who is 14 years of age or older that is responsible for the welfare of the child, a relative in same home as the child (or not) who is 18 years old or older. Mandatory reporters do not have to determine if a person is or isn’t meeting the criteria of a perpetrator to make a report. You are considered a mandatory reported (and required to report suspected child abuse) if you are: licensed or certified in any health-related field, a medical examiner, an employee of a health care facility who is engaged with the child, a school employee, or the employee of a child-care service who has direct contact with the child, just to name a few. Mandatory reporters must make a report if they have reasonable cause to suspect that a child is/had experienced child abuse and if they: are directly responsible for the care or training of the child (or work for an agency that does this), or a person makes a disclosure to the reporter. Abuse can also be reported to ChildLine or a county youth agency if there are concerns for the general safety and wellbeing of the child such as inadequate clothing, housing or supervision. Reports of suspected child abuse can be submitted to ChildLine’s website (<a href="http://www.compass.state.pa.us/cwis)">www.compass.state.pa.us/cwis)</a>or by calling 1-800-932-0313.
