For example, some of the longest standing fair use best practices, ones that have had considerable impact on music studies, are those compiled by the Music Library Association (MLA). The MLA best practices for several years now have allowed music faculty across the country to digitize and stream full-length music works in the classroom or in secure course management systems.<\/p>\n<p>The beauty of fair use best practices is that they are compiled by representatives from many academic institutions, and as such, publishers are generally reluctant to challenge such practices.<\/p>\n<p>The latest best practices to appear have been authored by the Association of Research Libraries in conjunction with the Center for Social Media and Washington College of Law&#8217;s Program on Information Justice and Intellectual Property. The\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.arl.org\/bm~doc\/code-of-best-practices-fair-use.pdf\">Code of Best Practices in Fair Use for Academic and Research Libraries<\/a>\u00a0(January 2012) articulates several practices that the authors feel are essential to the operation of libraries in higher education today. Areas addressed are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>teaching and learning with access to library materials via digital technologies<\/li>\n<li>using selections from collection materials to publicize a library&#8217;s activities, or to create physical and virtual exhibitions<\/li>\n<li>digitizing to preserve at-risk items<\/li>\n<li>creating digital collections of archival and special collections materials<\/li>\n<li>reproducing material for use by disabled students, faculty, staff, and other appropriate users<\/li>\n<li>maintaining the integrity of works deposited in institutional repositories<\/li>\n<li>creating databases to facilitate non-consumptive research uses<\/li>\n<li>collecting material posted on the world wide web and making it available<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Refer to the full\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.arl.org\/bm~doc\/code-of-best-practices-fair-use.pdf\">report<\/a>\u00a0to identify precisely what practices are promoted.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>Infomaniac Tip<\/strong><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><em><strong>Is Facebook Using You?<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p>In a recent New York Times opinion piece titled &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/02\/05\/opinion\/sunday\/facebook-is-using-you.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all\">Facebook is Using You<\/a>,&#8221; author Lori Andrews argues that Facebook is using it&#8217;s vast data mine of personal information to make profits. It&#8217;s hard to argue with Andrews&#8217; claim. Instead of an inventory of automobiles or packaged goods, Facebook has in its possession your daily activities, your behaviors, your preferences&#8211;everything you&#8217;re willing to share with your Facebook friends. Preparing to go public as a company, Facebook it touting it&#8217;s billion-dollar capacity to sell this mega-library of personal information to the highest bidder. As Andrews puts it, &#8220;The magnitude of online information Facebook has available about each of us for targeted marketing is stunning. In Europe, laws give people the right to know what data companies have about them, but that is not the case in the United States.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Feel used?<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>Calendar<\/strong><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>2\/22<\/strong>\u00a0&#8211;\u00a0Spring Trivia Night.
