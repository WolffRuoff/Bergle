					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Melissa, I think it&#039;s interesting to think about this as a new way of life. Grey mentions how we are going through a technology revolution, but it differs from any revolution humans have experienced in the past. So maybe don&#039;t think of it as a negative thing, but as a new way to communicate. (Playing devil&#039;s advocate, this is not my opinion.)&lt;/p&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I also find myself, and feel that other people check their phones immediately when they wake up in the morning. Which, can sometimes put me off schedule because I get carried away with it. I agree that many fail to notice the negatives that come along with being so reliant and involved with technology.&lt;/p&gt;
