					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;This was one of my favorite 30 for 30s ever. It was amazing to see the climb those guys made to the top of NBA. It was also very interesting to see and hear about all their different upbringings and backgrounds that helped shape them. I know people did not like them when they were playing. However, this video changed how a lot of people felt about them and wanted to love them.&lt;/p&gt;
