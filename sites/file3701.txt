					<description><![CDATA[It is interesting how much the Internet has transformed almost all media industries in the past decade or so. More and more businesses seem to realize that their success is tied to whether their product is available via the Internet. As we become more computer/tech-savvy (and lazy?) products that are not tied to the Internet in one way or another seem to be at a great disadvantage. Redbox is already extremely convenient but apparently not so much compared to Netflix. These services will likely reduce online movie piracy with their cheap prices and easy access at least.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Excellent article here, Group 3 - Again, just a little analysis is needed to really transform a good blog post into an excellent post.  What seems to be at stake here is both the distribution AND exhibition of video rentals.  Redbox seems to have solved the Blockbuster problem - that is, a rental environment with high overhead costs so that you need to pass along those extra costs to consumers in the way of rental fees (Blockbuster is currently attempting to emerge from bankruptcy).  Here is another low-overhead method to distribute material to consumers over the Internet.  If you focus on this case for your group presentation or perhaps individual papers, you might want to look at a slew of new competitors for Netflix (including the movie studios themselves) in home DVD distribution and exhibition.]]></description>
