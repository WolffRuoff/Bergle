								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In ‘It&#8217;s Complicated: The Social Lives of Networked Teens’, Danah Boyd the author, clarifies answers to the generational question of why do teens act the way they do online? Digital natives, being mostly teenagers these days, use social media as a way of creating and expressing their identity. But what does is lost in translation is who these teens believe are viewing their online persona.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One thing teens think of less often than not when posting to social media is the context collapse that they are faced with. This refers to the effects of social media and the infinite audience that is possible online as opposed to the limited groups a person normally interacts with. Sometimes it is easy to forget that just because we think we have control over who is viewing our content we actually don’t. This can bring about severe misinterpretations because our perceived audience is not always what we believe it to be. Teens these days are getting lost in the realm of imagined audiences rather than actual audiences. Every Time teens log onto social media they are faced with the notion of having an invisible audience. They know who they want their content to reach but simultaneously have no control over it. Consequences of these misinterpretations are especially exaggerated when it comes to things such as the college application. Possible applicants are usually warned to clean up their social media footprint in hopes of leaving no possibility of an unintended interpretation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When we are faced with an invisible audience we refer in our head to who we wish to appeal to but that invisible audience that exists can mean anything from teachers to childhood friends that are actually viewing our content. Some teens recognize that with applications such as Facebook and its increasing ability to connect people with one another, even with privacy settings, content reaches people much further than just those who they have accepted as friends or decide to follow, only increasing the invisible audience. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So next time you decide update the persona you hold online, whether that be with pictures or a status, think about who is actually seeing who you are online and decide if what you are putting online is worth the consequence of not always knowing who will be viewing it. </span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With AirBNB&#8217;s expansive networking of users, ease of usage, and appeal of modern day traveling, it is easier now than ever to truly find a home away from home. For those that are unfamiliar with the estimated $20 billion valued company, Airbnb offers easy renting for guests that are looking for anything from single rooms and apartments to castles and tree houses. The company&#8217;s booming and unique platform of connecting hosts and travelers without owning any room itself has driven it so such success.</span></p>
<p>With the company&#8217;s unique advertising of having guests stay in real homes of others they try to optimize safety and transparency. Technology today makes us feel like we can market ourselves to appear a certain way but still hold onto a sense of security and privacy. Airbnb requires that all guests provide a valid ID as well as all hosts with videotaping equipment explicitly say so in their listing. Precautions such as these make it so guests and users alike can display a fake persona or invade a guest&#8217;s privacy. Hosts may also use the apps new messaging feature to converse with interested guests to determine if they want to accept the person&#8217;s offer. With features like this technology provides ways for people to communicate while forcing them to be transparent.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">All though certain rules such as these are put into place there are also defaults in the system. Reports of vandalism of houses with extreme damages have occurred as well as people&#8217;s rooms being put up for rent without their knowledge. Despite the Airbnb&#8217;s ability to cut out any middleman in the process of booking between host and guest there are still gaps and miscommunication that come when using technology to communicate. Just because the network has made it easier to access one another doesn’t mean we always are who we say we are behind a screen. Airbnb has the ability to make it possible to not even have to face the person that is renting your space. The chatting and messenger feature can also be harmful in that people get tricked into knowing the person behind the screen when in fact that is not the case.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Social media as we know it has become so widely accessible and weaved into every aspect of our lives that tit has given our generation a name of digital natives. From Twitter to Instagram and all social media platforms in-between, technology today has the ability to satisfy our need for human connection. Whether it be by seeing updated photos of events or phrases of our night being limited to a tweet, it is hard to  escape knowing peoples whereabouts. One of the many dangers of this though is the increasing  amount of platforms to bully and hurt people on. Numerous social media apps gain fame and net worth through their fan bases but their initial  start up point is in investors willing to put money towards their ideas. Yik Yak was able to be valued at almost $300 million because of its investors believed in the app&#8217;s ability to  create &#8220;hyper local forums [providing] a sense of community  and a place to be our genuine selves&#8221;. The consequences though are threats and demeaning comments that are becoming increasingly more prevalent even as the apps owners try to control exactly what is allowed on the platform. Author William D. Cohan of  the article &#8220;In the Rise of Yik Yak App, Profits and Ethics Collide&#8221;, he brings up the question if the initial investors should be held responsible for these actions. Whether of not theses investors foresaw the possible down sides of this app or not comes into question and we must consider if introducing new technology in general should be monitored more closely in order to provide a safe environment for the use of these tools. In the new age of digital natives it is arguable that no generation has had more access to being connected to one another than any before. Social media platforms have the ability to connect people from within one and half miles of each other, such as in Yik Yak, to across the globe with apps like Instagram or Twitter.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In Mike Hanski’s “Want to Be a Better Writer? Read More”, there is no simpler equation of how achieve greatness in the realm of writing. At first glance, the title seems almost too straight forward to be believable, but in fact it is as simple a solution as it seems. Writing goes hand in hand with reading and can most simply be explained by Steven Wright’s statement that “somehow the reading gear in your head turns the writing gear”. Even though it is hard to believe that Hanski could have given away the secret ingredient to better reading in the just the title of an article it is in fact true, but you must be asking yourself where are the facts to back up this seemingly black and white solution. Not only has reading been proven to better prepare kids for school, widen vocabulary, and help students remember grammar rules, but it has the power to help us better understand ourselves. Hanski urges readers to not only go through the motions of reading but to dive into subject matter that is stimulating that way it is more likely that stimulating writing will follow. It is easy to fall back on the saying that practice makes perfect but it is made clear that “only reading can help you achieve greatness”. By reading of not only what interests us at the moment but also what might be utterly unfamiliar we are able to gain insight into who we are as a person. Our interests broaden with reading and the mold of what makes us who we are emergers. Reading is the ingredient to being able to translate this onto paper. The ever so simple equation is balanced in the end and can even make us wonder if reading alone can not only lead us to being better writers but better people.</span></p>
