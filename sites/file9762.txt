			<p>Instead of our usual athletes of the week, this Monday we bring you plays of the week for contests between November 28 and December 4.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/12/zabreckyhs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-563" title="Alita Zabrecky" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/12/zabreckyhs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Female Play of the Week &#8211; Alita Zabrecky&#8217;s crazy shot</strong></p>
<p>Zabrecky got two points for the basket but many more for creativity on this shot late in the first half of Saturday&#8217;s game against Washington. With the Mules leading 28-22 and about 2:40 to play in the half, Zabrecky chased down a long rebound of a missed three-pointer and dribbled the length of the court. Anticipating contact when she got into the lane, she flung the ball up with her right (non-shooting) hand, and it went off the glass and in. She got the foul call as well, but missed the free throw.</p>
<p>The basket gave Muhlenberg its biggest lead (30-22) to that point. The Mules led by as many as 15 in the second half and went on to win, 71-63. Zabrecky finished with a game-high 18 points.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/12/zabrecky_layup.wmv">Click here to watch video of the shot.</a> Note the Washington coach putting her hands on her head in disbelief.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/12/curryhs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-560" title="Austin Curry" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/12/curryhs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Male Play of the Week &#8211; Austin Curry&#8217;s game-tying three</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-family: mceinline;">It was desperation time for Muhlenberg against Washington on Saturday &#8211; trailing by three with time ticking down. After the Mules&#8217; initial attempt at a game-tying shot missed, AJ Dean snagged the rebound and found Curry, who was on the wing, cutting to the corner. Although a Shoreman player got a hand in his face, Curry drained the shot, tying the score at 79. </span></p>
<p>Curry made another last-gasp three in overtime for the last of his 14 points, but Washington won, 96-93.</p>

			<p>It&#8217;s the last full weekend of athletic events in the year 2011.</p>
<p><strong>Basketball Doubleheader vs. Washington College (Saturday, women at 2, men at 4)</strong></p>
<p>Both basketball teams will be playing at home for the first time since winning the Scotty Wood Tournament two weeks ago. Since then, the women have remained undefeated with a pair of wins while climbing up to No. 13 in the national poll, and the men have gone 3-1 with a tournament championship at Gallaudet.</p>
<p>The Mule teams have a combined record of 11-1. The women have won their last two games by 15 points each, and the men have taken their last two by 40 and 23.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not good news for the Washington teams on what is traditionally a difficult trip for them anyway. Since the start of Centennial Conference play, neither the Shorewomen or the Shoremen have won at Memorial Hall. The Shorewomen (2-2 this year) are winless all-time in Allentown, and the Shoremen (2-3) haven&#8217;t won at Muhlenberg since the 1989 Scotty Wood Tournament.</p>

			<p>It&#8217;s been said many times: The Scotty Wood Tournament is about so much more than basketball. And while the basketball was great &#8211; the Muhlenberg teams swept the championship games for the second year in a row &#8211; here are some of the other things that took place on the court, which contribute to Scotty Wood being a notable annual event for the entire Muhlenberg campus and the community at large.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/11/swt_madeira.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-514" title="Dave Madeira" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/11/swt_madeira.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="332" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/11/swt_madeira.jpg 350w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/11/swt_madeira-300x284.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/11/swt_madeira-316x300.jpg 316w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" /></a>Former men&#8217;s basketball coach Dave Madeira (pictured with Dean of Students Karen Green) received the Scotty Wood Tournament Community Service Award. It was the first time back at Muhlenberg for Madeira since he retired and moved to Charlotte to be closer to his grandchildren following the 2008-09 season. In 22 seasons as head coach, he won 311 games &#8211; more than any other coach in Muhlenberg athletic history.</p>
<p>At halftime of the Muhlenberg women&#8217;s game on Friday, five Mule student-athletes were presented with their plaques for earning Capital One Academic All-America recognition last year. The five Academic All-Americans were the most in a school year in College history. Pictured below, left to right, are Ashley Brewer &#8217;11, Spencer Liddic, Brittany DeAngelis, Michael Baer and the parents of Bobby Torphy &#8217;11, Bob and Marg Torphy.</p>

<p>Balls went back and forth down the court throughout the tournament, with the winning team scoring at least 90 points in four of the eight games. But there was also a ceremonial exchange of balls.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/11/swt_msgball.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-511" title="Madison Square Garden ball" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/11/swt_msgball-290x300.jpg" alt="" width="290" height="300" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/11/swt_msgball-290x300.jpg 290w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/11/swt_msgball.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 290px) 100vw, 290px" /></a>The Wood Family donated to Muhlenberg a ball used in a game between Muhlenberg and Long Island University played at Madison Square Garden in March 1949. Below, Jonathan Sheftel, grandson of Scotty Wood and nephew of Bob Wood, does the honors in a ceremonial jump ball between Leeann Lanza of Muhlenberg and Liz West of TCNJ prior to the women&#8217;s championship game. Lanza won the ceremonial toss, but West won the one that counted a few minutes later.</p>

It’s not a common occurrence.</p>
<p>But that when the Mules reached triple digits, it came in the Scotty Wood Tournament – that’s less rare.</p>
<p>In the 30 years since the start of the Scotty Wood Tournament, Muhlenberg has scored at least 100 points in 12 games. Remarkably, half of those were in the Scotty Wood Tournament:</p>
<ul>
<li>1988 Muhlenberg 104, Haverford 46</li>
<li>1992 Muhlenberg 103, Drew 87</li>
<li>1993 Muhlenberg 109, Eastern Mennonite 47</li>
<li>2003 Muhlenberg 115, Elms 68</li>
<li>2007 Muhlenberg 107, Philadelphia Biblical 37</li>
<li>2011 Muhlenberg 100, SUNY Cobleskill 73</li>
</ul>
<p>In mathematical terms, the Mules have reached the century mark six times in 59 Scotty Wood Tournament games – one every 10. In non-Scotty Wood contests during the same period, Muhlenberg scored 100 six times in 680 games – one every 113 games.</p>
<p>No men’s team has ever scored 100 points in a Scotty Wood championship game, but if the Mules become the first tonight, they will also reach triple digits in back-to-back games for the first time in 43 years.</p>
<p>With the women’s 94-60 win against Shenandoah, the Muhlenberg men’s and women’s teams set a record for combined points (194) on the opening day of the Scotty Wood Tournament. In 2003, the teams combined to score 219 points on the second day.</p>

			<p>Want to see the best in Division III basketball this winter? Come to a Muhlenberg doubleheader.</p>
<p>The D3hoops.com preseason All-America teams were released this week, and of the nearly 400 schools that sponsor men’s and women’s basketball at the Division III level, Muhlenberg was one of only two (Wheaton of Illinois was the other) to have a representative on both teams. Spencer Liddic of the men’s team was named to the second team, and women’s player Alexandra Chili was a third-team selection.</p>
<p>Here’s a quick look at how the two preseason All-Americans compare:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/chili.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-339" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/chili.jpg" alt="" width="138" height="296" /></a>Alexandra Chili</strong></li>

</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/liddic.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-340" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/liddic.jpg" alt="" width="138" height="296" /></a>Spencer Liddic</strong></li>
<li>Number: 34</li>
<li>Position: Forward</li>
<li>Hometown: Clarks Summit, Pa.</li>
<li>All-Centennial Conference first team: 2010 and 2011</li>

</ul>
<p>The two have a lot in common, from their academic and athletic successes at Muhlenberg to mutual respect for each other.</p>
<p>“Spencer Liddic will have always have a talent that I will never be able to possess; the dunk,” said Chili. “Often, I&#8217;ve asked Big Spence, ‘Will you teach me how to dunk? Teach me, teach me how to dunk,’ and even with his best efforts, the second-team preseason All-American has had little success. I recognize that the fault lies in my own athletic shortcomings and that maybe it&#8217;s time I try to pass something on to Spencer. I think the behind-the-back pass will fit into his repertoire perfectly.</p>
<p>“Boasting a D3hoops.com all-region first team and a unanimous All-Centennial Conference selection for the second year in a row, Spencer&#8217;s junior year sealed his fate as one of the most influential men&#8217;s basketball players of the Muhlenberg program. I know his senior year will only be better. This season, not only will Spencer stun the crowd with his unstoppable double-doubles, beautiful elbow jumpers and sweet post moves, he will continue to be a great senior leader. His hustle on the court never stops and he truly inspires all his teammates, and even the women&#8217;s team, to play better. I&#8217;ve been fortunate to share the spotlight the past few years with the stellar Spencer and I can&#8217;t wait to start our seasons up against Moravian on November 15! I know it will be a great year for all of us.”</p>
<p>&#8220;It has been such an amazing experience getting the opportunity to watch Alex Chili grow and mature over the past few years into the dominant player she is today,&#8221; said Liddic. &#8220;Her most obvious threat is her unbelievable shooting ability. She has had players attempt to faceguard her since freshman year, and nothing seems to stop her. Another one of Alex’s strengths is her ability to find her teammates. Over the past three years, she has impressed the crowd over and over again with her behind-the-back passes and alley-oops to various high-flying dunkers on her team.</p>
<p>&#8220;Players like Alex only come around once in a lifetime and it’s an honor to have the opportunity to watch her play since freshman year. I look forward to once again watching Alex dominate the court and can’t wait to see which Muhlenberg, Centennial and D3 record she will be breaking this year.&#8221;</p>

			<p><em>The Student-Athlete Advisory Committee (SAAC) was adopted by the NCAA in 1989, formed primarily to review and offer student-athlete input on NCAA activities and proposed legislation that affect student-athlete welfare. NCAA legislation mandates that all member institutions have SAACs on their respective campuses. Last weekend, junior Kate Clawson (basketball) and senior Nick Busillo (baseball) represented Muhlenberg at the Centennial Conference SAAC Leadership Retreat. Here&#8217;s what they wrote about their experience:</em></p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/clawsonhs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-241" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/clawsonhs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>(KC) The SAAC retreat was held at the Wyndham Hotel in Harrisburg, Pa., and was attended by 20 student-athletes, about two from each school. On Friday, when we arrived we met Keith Waldman, from OPA, who does team building with teams all over the nation. First, he led us through some team building activities to better get to know each other. All the athletes were very welcoming, as was Renee Fraker, the director of championships in our conference who put the retreat together.</p>
<p>(NB) There were two baseball players from Ursinus at the conference. It was funny because of course my natural instinct was to not like these kids, but they were both nice kids. Jokes and predictions were made, and that made things interesting, but all in all they were great kids and it was a great experience.</p>
<p>(KC) I really enjoyed the team building activities because each of them taught us things we <a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/saac_clawson.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-245" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/saac_clawson.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="306" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/saac_clawson.jpg 400w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/saac_clawson-300x229.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/saac_clawson-392x300.jpg 392w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></a>could apply to accomplishing team goals, staying positive, learning from our mistakes and becoming better leaders. This was definitely one of my favorite parts of the trip. We also brought along our resumes for the professional development portion of the weekend where we talked about the importance of networking and interview tips, which were very beneficial for everyone.</p>
<p>On Saturday we talked about issues that athletes face on campus and problem solving for each of the issues. Everyone shared their ideas, which were very helpful, and it was cool to see what each school had to say.</p>
<p><em></em><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/busillohs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-242" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/busillohs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>(NB) One common issue that I noticed was the balancing of sports and academics. Although presently we are not fans of the workload, we all recognized that in the long run this will all be beneficial for us. We all recognized that we are students first and that it comes with being a student-athlete.</p>
<p>(KC) Next we went over the proposals for new NCAA legislation. This was really important because it gave us as student-athletes a say in what regulations were being passed. We got to offer our opinions and knew that they were actually going to matter.</p>
<p>At the end of a long day on Saturday we met with members from the Special Olympics, had a pizza party and played bocce with them. We definitely had a thing or two to learn about bocce as we saw that the Special Olympics athletes weren&#8217;t taking it easy on us. I think we all got beat that day, but it was still really fun to hang out with them and learn from them. I think it taught us how determined the athletes of Special Olympics are, and it was <a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/saac_busillo.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-246" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/saac_busillo.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="301" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/saac_busillo.jpg 450w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/saac_busillo-300x200.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/saac_busillo-448x300.jpg 448w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a>pretty inspirational to hear some of their stories, one woman who got to go to China for the Olympics and had been a member since the 1970s.</p>
<p>Overall, I had a great weekend, met really influential people, and learned a lot that I can take back to the SAAC group as well as to Muhlenberg athletics as a whole.</p>
<p>(NB) During discussions I learned of all the fundraising activities that other schools are doing. I know Muhlenberg does their part in fundraising, but these schools had some great ideas that would not be bad thing for Muhlenberg to take a look into.</p>

			<p><em><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/rohnhs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-79" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/rohnhs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Muhlenberg women&#8217;s basketball coach Ron Rohn reviews the upcoming movie The Mighty Macs. <a title="The Mighty Macs" href="http://www.themightymacs.com/">Click here </a>for more information on the movie and to watch the trailer.</em></p>
<p>Recently, I was invited to a special pre-screening of the upcoming Hollywood movie <em>The Mighty Macs</em>, based on the story of the women’s basketball team at tiny Immaculata College in southeastern Pennsylvania (about 40 miles from Muhlenberg). The film is scheduled to be released nationally in theatres on October 21.  </p>
<p>Immaculata, coached by Cathy Rush (inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 2008), won the first ever college national championship for women in 1972 and also won the title in 1973 and 1974. These were the pre-NCAA days for women’s sports, when the AIAW (Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women) ran women’s basketball – quite simply because the “old boys” of the NCAA had no interest in “girl’s sports.” It was common for small schools to be successful, since the bigger state schools were not spending much money on women’s teams, despite Title IX becoming law in 1972. </p>
<p>Even so the story of the Mighty Macs of Immaculata College (a women’s college of 400 commuters) was an attention grabber even back then. The nuns who ran the college would attend games banging on empty buckets with wooden spoons, making a racket that drove opponents crazy – and of course photos of this would make the nightly news and were seen in newspapers across the nation. </p>
<p>Knowing the basic story and characters, I was interested to see how the subject would be presented from a Hollywood production – how historically accurate it would be, and how bad would the basketball scenes look (action scenes from popular sports movies often<a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/TheMightyMacs_Poster_sm.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-80" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/TheMightyMacs_Poster_sm.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="296" /></a> look laughably amateurish). </p>
<p>So let me first off say that the basketball scenes, which are many, are done very, very well. Producers of the movie, of which former 76ers owner Pat Croce was a driving force, made the intelligent decision to hire former high school and college players to play opposing teams in the movie. Even the main characters are actresses with college and high school playing experience. This gives the passing, dribbling, shooting and player movement a very natural and genuine look. In a few cases maybe too good, considering how far the skills of women’s players have come in the past 40 years. </p>
<p>The movie opens with Cathy Rush driving to Immaculata to interview for the head coaching job there. I got to know Cathy by attending her summer basketball camps in the ’80s and ’90s, and I was amazed by how much Carla Gugino (the love interest in <em>Night at the Museum</em> among her many credits) looked like Cathy Rush. As the movie developed I smiled seeing how well Gugino had captured Rush’s character – a caring woman with spunk, aggressiveness and a firm belief that women should never have to take a back seat to a man, even in the world of sports. Never shy to be sure. </p>
<p>She coached “players,” not “girls.” Teamwork, winning, a driving desire to be the best should be the goals regardless of whether you were male or female. Remember that these were not widely accepted traits for women in 1972 – in fact they were often thought to be “un-ladylike” as were sports in general.</p>
<p>In this area the movie hits a home run (or I guess a three-point shot, which also did not exist in 1972). Historical accuracy in terms of wool tunics as uniforms, small basement <a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/image1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-81" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/image1.jpg" alt="" width="210" height="208" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/image1.jpg 210w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/image1-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 210px) 100vw, 210px" /></a>gyms with the wall being out of bounds, and the attitudes of people towards females in athletics is also spot on. The film would be worth seeing for any female athlete, just for the lesson in how far things have come since then.</p>
<p>But the time-tested themes of belief in one’s self and others, the collective strength of individuals coming together to become a true team, and the underdog winning the day all make the film uplifting as well. </p>
<p>There are cute cameos by many of the “real-life” people the movie is based on. Cathy Rush herself plays a bank teller. My favorite is a scene in which the real members of the 1972 team play nuns, sitting together at mass. In this scene, Rush passes a note down the pew of nuns to a tall girl who plays the role of the college-aged Theresa Shank Grentz – future All-American and star of the team. Playing the nun who finally hands the note to the girl is the real-life Grentz. </p>
<p>Accomplished actress Ellyn Burstyn is the perfect Mother Superior, and will bring flashbacks to childhood – if like me you ever attended Catholic school.</p>
<p>Of course this is a Hollywood movie, not a documentary, so it is not 100 percent exactly how it happened – in some cases for dramatic effect, others for comedic purposes (there were many loud laughs at the screening I attended).  In the movie a young nun becomes Cathy Rush’s assistant coach, something that never happened. Later Rush dresses like a nun herself when the college can’t afford enough tickets for the team to fly to the national tournament (nuns could fly free on United Airlines in those days, so the movie says). Again, pure fiction. In real life the school could only afford nine tickets, so Rush and eight players flew to nationals, while three players and assistant coaches stayed home.</p>
<p>The other area where Hollywood wins out over history is in what is known as “time compression” – merging events together, or over a shorter period of time, to make the story more dramatic or economical in length.</p>
<p>In <em>The Mighty Macs</em> coach Rush arrives in the fall of 1972, just after the gym has burned down – and after losing games early, she slowly brings the team around to where they win the national championship by season’s end. In real life Rush took over at Immaculata in <a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/image2.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-82" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/image2.jpg" alt="" width="210" height="208" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/image2.jpg 210w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/image2-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 210px) 100vw, 210px" /></a>1970 (two years after the gym burned down in 1968) and built a pretty good team by 1972. </p>
<p>Some things that seem as if they must have been invented for the movie actually happened that way. The team did actually lose by 32 points in the regional playoffs to West Chester University, and did indeed come back one week later to defeat the same team to win the national championship. </p>
<p>After the screening, Cathy Rush was on hand to answer questions about the film. She said that a scene where many of the female students and all of the nuns at the college stay up late to greet the team as they arrive home after an especially dispiriting loss was so true to the actual event that she and Hall of Fame sports writer Mel Greenberg were crying as they watched it being filmed.</p>
<p>Somewhere along their improbable run to the championship, Rush remembers the team’s point guard saying to her – “they should be a make a movie about this.” Now they have, and it’s one worth seeing.</p>
