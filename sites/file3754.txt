								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Trust, G. (5 April 2011). ‘Glee’ cast, Matthew Morrison score first radio hit, thanks to original songs. <em>Billboard</em>. Retrieved from <a href="http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/industry/tv-film/glee-cast-matthew-morrison-score-first-1005113042.story">http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/industry/tv-film/glee-cast-matthew-morrison-score-first-1005113042.story</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://blogs.villagevoice.com/dailymusto/Glee-Cast-glee-9252428-600-429.jpg" alt="" width="241" height="173" />What’s the difference between <em>American Idol</em> and <em>Glee</em>? After all, both are television shows that promote the music industry. One difference is that, until now, Fox&#8217;s <em>Glee</em> wasn’t in the business of producing new artists. While some of the <em>Glee</em> cast’s covers have taken the Internet by storm and run quickly up the Billboard Top 100—<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds38BOOtGIQ"><em>Don’t Stop Believin’</em> may be the most famous</a>—they’re still just different versions of already-famous songs. All of that changed, however, with the recent release of the first song produced specifically for the show, called “Loser Like Me,” which has a critical advantage over all the covers: It’s getting radio airplay, premiering at #37 on the Nielson Adult Top 40.</p>
<p><span id="more-1082"></span></p>
<p>This, of course, is huge. The radio and sound recording industries have been connected at the hip since their mutual beginnings during the turn of last century. Radio is a critical facilitator for the music industry, introducing targeted demographics of consumers to new music; radio, in turn, relies on other media to supply fresh material for its listeners. Producers, for their part, are all too willing to do that. The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/26/business/26music.html?_r=1">desperation with which producers jockey for radio airtime</a> speaks to radio’s enduring importance to the music industry in the age of 200-channel television and iTunes. Increasingly these producers include the owners and creators of television shows like <em>Glee</em> who are hoping to run their content through another window.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The producers of <em>Glee</em>, like the labels that sign the <em>American Idol</em> winners, can opt out of this desperation because their artists are practically guaranteed airplay. <em>Glee</em>’s enormous popularity on television means that the cast’s music, which premieres on the show, is practically “pre-sold.” Radio program directors take huge risks when they add new music to their playlists, and they’re always looking for ways to reduce that risk. What better way to do that than to play music that’s already popular on other media, like television?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indeed, the <em>Glee</em> cast’s transition from mere facilitators pimping other artists’ music every week to producers releasing new material has been nearly seamless, with program directors scrambling to play the new music. The music fits perfectly with what the modern pop radio industry wants: It’s upbeat, unchallenging, and <a href="http://www.billboard.com/news/glee-returns-with-huge-ratings-win-1004115894.story#/news/glee-returns-with-huge-ratings-win-1004115894.story">already popular with that crucial 18-34-year old audience</a> (<em>Glee</em> consistently ranks #1 among that audience, teenagers in general, and teenage girls in particular, the equivalent of a royal flush for Fox). Interviews with program directors across the country confirm that sentiment, with one program director in Indiana lauding the new song’s ability to “resonate with kids and parents” and admitting that the new song’s origins in <em>Glee</em> give it a “leg up” in gaining airplay on her station.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <em>Glee</em> cast will soon promote their new music by going out on tour, with 22 scheduled appearances set to begin on June 22nd in Minneapolis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The success of <em>Glee</em>’s new music speaks to the power of a popular program to travel across media. With a variety of television shows either playing others’ music or facilitating the production of new music, the synergy between the two industries has never been stronger. Media industries like radio, sound recording, and television help each other reduce risk by mutually sharing popular content, which translates into stronger revenues for the large conglomerates that own most media companies today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whether that translates into more choice for consumers, however, is questionable. Public advocates continue to argue that the sharing of content across media, especially unchallenging content like the <em>Glee</em> music that appeals to the lowest common denominator, drowns out artists and voices with alternative views that may challenge the media conglomerates. Until popular music stops making money, however, the conglomerates are likely to continue to encourage this type of cross-promotion of content into the future.</p>

<p>Albiniak.P (2011 March 14) Selling the Glee: Twentieth Television turns its attention to pitching its hit to stations for 2013 <em>Broadcasting and Cable </em>retrived from:<a href="http://0-web.ebscohost.com.library.muhlenberg.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=01ff61a1-db46-49b8-b3ca-e777fb23c69a%40sessionmgr10&amp;vid=7&amp;hid=15">http://0-web.ebscohost.com.library.muhlenberg.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=01ff61a1-db46-49b8-b3ca-e777fb23c69a%40sessionmgr10&amp;vid=7&amp;hid=15</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whether it’s on magazine covers or red carpet shows, the stars of Glee seem to be everywhere.  But Twentieth Television, which produces Glee, has plans to make the show even more ubiquitous.  Glee’s original episodes air on the Fox network, which makes sense as both Twentieth Television and Fox are owned by News Corps—both producer and distributor are owned by the same media conglomerate.   However, last summer, Twentieth Television sold syndication rights of Glee to Oxygen, a network owned by NBC Universal, which falls under the Comcast umbrella.  Here we see one television distributor making a deal with another one—a deal that has proved beneficial for NBC Universal’s Oxygen, which earned a record 4.4 million viewers during a weekend of Glee re-runs (a “Gleekend”).<span id="more-1032"></span></p>
<p>But Twentieth Television’s plans for Glee don&#8217;t stop there.   Twentieth’s mission is to get the rest of the country on board the “Glee train.” The television producer is seeking to sell syndication rights to television stations, both Fox affiliates and independent stations,across the country. This represents an attempt to go directly to exhibitors,many of whom have hours that need to be filled with content.  Glee re-runs could be a very viable option for these stations: the show’s audience is predominately female, and, crucially, predominately affluent.  This is the kind of audience that advertisers, or clients, are willing spend a lot of money on, as this demographic has a lot of buying power. Plus, Glee has proven to be a ratings smash, with both new episodes and re-runs earning large audiences, so acquiring the rights to air Glee could be financially smart for the exhibitors that are given the opportunity to grab a slice of the Glee pie.</p>
<p>As if that wasn’t enough, there is a spin-off reality show in the works. This summer, Oxygen will air The Glee Project, a reality show in which contestants will compete for a spot on Glee.  This program is yet another example of Glee’s already-abundant examples of linking pin activities, including CDs and music downloads featuring the songs head on the show.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Morabito, Andrea. (2011, Feb. 7). <em>Broadcasting &amp; Cable. </em>Retrieved from <a href="http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/463581-Super_Bowl_XLV_is_Most_Watched_TV_Program_Ever.php" target="_blank">http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/463581-Super_Bowl_XLV_is_Most_Watched_TV_Program_Ever.php</a>.</p>
<p>Super Bowl XLV last Sunday February 6, was the most watched television show in U.S. history. The game averaged 111 million total views. This beat last year’s Super Bowl’s record of 106.5 million spectators. The Super Bowl always rakes in extreme high numbers of viewers and for the past four years has set a viewership records.</p>
<p>            After the Super Bowl, an episode of <em>Glee</em> aired from 10:30 to 11:45 p.m. 26.8 million people watched increasing its total viewers 17% from its weekly average.<em> Glee’s</em> numbers were bigger than the episode of <em>The Office</em> that followed 2009’s Super Bowl. However, last year’s post Super Bowl’s episode of <em>Undercover Boss</em> drew bigger numbers than both <em>Glee </em>and The <em>Office.<span id="more-769"></span></em></p>
<p>            We suspect that the broad audience of a reality television show would lure in more viewers than a musically based high school sitcom. This makes us think about the idea of public interest and why Fox chose such a special interest show that does not seem to fit the same audience as the Super Bowl. An event like the Super Bowl can unite all different ages and demographics showing the positive possibilities for television. When Fox chooses to show a program like <em>Glee</em>, we feel the network has other motives in mind besides the public interest. Were they trying to attract a broader audience to increase network’s long term viewership? Was Fox trying to piggy back off of the popularity of the Super Bowl to increase <em>Glee’s</em> fan base? While <em>Glee</em> has proved its success, we feel that a show like <em>Undercover Boss</em> which has a wider appeal may have been a better fit for the Super Bowl’s audience’s actual desires and interests. This brings us back to the power relationship between the network heads and the audience. Networks don’t necessarily have to give audiences what may be best but instead they focus on what may be most lucrative, ultimately choosing their rising star, <em>Glee</em>. While traditional all-American football fans may not always mix with musical theater lovers, with Fox has anything to say about it, they will.</p>
