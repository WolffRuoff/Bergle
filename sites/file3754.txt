								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am currently sitting in my room at home in Maryland trying to figure out how to fit all the feelings I am currently having about just graduating from Muhlenberg into one blog post that is not twenty pages long, and let me tell you, it is not easy. The feeling is almost indescribable.</p>
<div id="attachment_2284" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/05/IMG_0881.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2284" class="size-medium wp-image-2284" src="http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/05/IMG_0881-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/05/IMG_0881-300x300.jpg 300w, http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/05/IMG_0881-150x150.jpg 150w, http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/05/IMG_0881-1024x1024.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2284" class="wp-caption-text">Senior Brunch <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="üôÇ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p></div>
<p>Muhlenberg was an amazing place for me to grow, learn and mature over the last four years. I was given opportunities that I do not think I would have gotten many other places. The faculty, staff and peers I met on campus were instrumental in helping me become the person that I am today and I do not know where I would be without the amazingly supportive community that I had at Muhlenberg. There are even alumni out there who I may never meet who gave in some way to the school or helped create a program that I participated in. ¬†So from the bottom of my heart, I want to say thank you.</p>
<div id="attachment_2285" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/05/IMG_0899.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2285" class="size-medium wp-image-2285" src="http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/05/IMG_0899-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/05/IMG_0899-300x300.jpg 300w, http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/05/IMG_0899-150x150.jpg 150w, http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/05/IMG_0899-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/05/IMG_0899.jpg 1936w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2285" class="wp-caption-text">Baccalaureate ceremony the night before graduation</p></div>
<p>I will miss many things about Muhlenberg, and while I am really sad to leave this part of my life, I am excited to take Muhlenberg with me into the ‚Äúreal world‚Äù. I am physically leaving Muhlenberg, but it really will always be with me. I have memories and stories for hours about the amazing moments that took place at college. Those moments that shaped me as a person today. Those moments that tested me and challenged me. Those moments that surprised me and shocked me. Those moments that excited and wowed me. Those moments will stay with me forever and will influence the rest of my life. I cannot wait to see what lies in store for me next and who from Muhlenberg I may get the pleasure to share it with.</p>

<p>As an official Muhlenberg alumna, I just want to say thank you to everyone again for helping me through this college journey especially my family and friends. It has been an unforgettable ride and I am so happy that I got to share it with so many wonderful people.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are many things that I am going to miss about Muhlenberg, but as it gets closer and closer to graduation, I realize that I am really going to miss the theatre and dance community here at Muhlenberg.</p>
<p>Being a part of the theatre and dance community at Muhlenberg is like being a part of a huge, crazy family. I will start with the dance community first. Coming into college, I always enjoyed dancing, but I was really focused on theatre. The one passion in dancing that I have is tap dancing. I never thought I would be able to pursue it because I was so heavily involved in other activities, but that could not have been farther from the truth at &#8216;Berg. I was able to participate in classes, a couple performances and do the community tap ensemble. I am so grateful to have had the opportunity to follow my passion of tap dancing without having to sacrifice any other interest in the process. On Tuesday, a couple of the other tap dancing seniors and I had tea time with Shelley. It was a lot of fun but really bittersweet. Tap was a bigger part of my life than I ever expected it to be at college but I would not have had it any other way. The dance community is strong at Muhlenberg. They let you in with open arms and you build¬† strong ties that will stay with you for a very long time.</p>
<div id="attachment_2272" style="width: 235px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/05/IMG_0828.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2272" class="size-medium wp-image-2272" src="http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/05/IMG_0828-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/05/IMG_0828-225x300.jpg 225w, http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/05/IMG_0828-768x1024.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2272" class="wp-caption-text">Tea Time Tuesday with Tap Teacher Shelley <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="üôÇ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p></div>
<p>And now the theatre community. I do not really know where to start. The faculty and staff in the theatre department have been the most amazing support system for me throughout my four years at college. I never imagined I would be able to have such incredible opportunities at college. On Tuesday, there was a dinner with the faculty and staff of the Theatre and Dance departments, and it was really nice to have final conversations with the people who had such an impact on my life. It really made me reflect on just how special the theatre is at Muhlenberg. So this is just my moment to say thank you, thank you, thank you, to every faculty and staff member in the department who has supported me in my journey in the theatre. I am so grateful to have met and learned from all of you and what I have learned will stay with me for the rest of my life. I truly want to thank you for that.</p>
<div id="attachment_2276" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/05/IMG_0834.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2276" class="size-medium wp-image-2276" src="http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/05/IMG_0834-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/05/IMG_0834-300x225.jpg 300w, http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/05/IMG_0834-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2276" class="wp-caption-text">Some of the faculty and staff at the Theatre and Dance dinner</p></div>
<p>Now a message to all my peers in theatre and dance: you all have been my rock throughout my time at Muhlenberg. I do not know what I would do without everyone who I have collaborated with, performed alongside or worked on shows with in any capacity. You are all so special to me, and I only hope that we can continue to create out in the real world. There is such a comfort working with such talented, smart and honest people like you all are. For the underclassmen: I wish you the best in your artistic pursuits at Muhlenberg. For the class of 2013: Keep on doing what you love and this is not goodbye, its just see you later &lt;3</p>
