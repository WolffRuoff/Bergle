        <p align="justify">The College endeavors to help students avoid academic difficulty. &nbsp;Historically, the most successful students attend class regularly, complete and submit assignments in a timely fashion, and seek assistance from instructors, advisors, Student Health Services, or the Academic Resource Center at the first signs of trouble. &nbsp;Moreover, students who are successful academically have learned to balance extracurricular activities with academics.</p>
<p align="justify">Academic&nbsp;performance is monitored closely by the Dean of Academic Life each term. &nbsp;The Dean will contact students at the conclusion of each term whose academic performance indicates a cause for concern.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Academic Warning&nbsp;</strong>may be triggered by any&nbsp;combination of two or more failing grades, incomplete grades, unsatisfactory grades, or course withdrawals in a term; a term grade point average below 1.80; or a cumulative grade point average less than the standards described in the table that follows.</p>
<p align="justify">Formal <strong>academic probation</strong> indicates that the quality of the student's work is below the level that might reasonably be expected to lead to graduation. &nbsp;A term grade point average below 1.00 or a cumulative grade point average less than the standards described below identify those students eligible for formal probation. &nbsp;All student performance indicating eligibility for formal probation will be reviewed by the Dean of Academic Life. &nbsp;After the review has been completed, students experiencing the most serious academic difficulties will be placed on formal probation. &nbsp;Student progress during the probationary period &nbsp;will &nbsp;be &nbsp;carefully &nbsp;examined. &nbsp;</p>
<p align="justify">At any time during the period, typically no more than two terms, the College can elect to remove the student from probation, continue the student on probation, or dismiss the student from Muhlenberg. &nbsp;Furthermore, students on formal probation seeking to enroll additional courses beyond what is considered a "normal load", either at Muhlenberg or elsewhere, are permitted to do so only at the discretion of the Dean of Academic Life; this provision includes enrollment in any type of summer term.</p>
<p align="justify">Cumulative academic performance is gauged on the number of course units <em><span class="italic">attempted </span></em> at Muhlenberg plus any transferred course units. &nbsp;Cumulative grade point averages less than the standards described in the table indicate the specific level of academic difficulty.</p>

        <p align="justify">The Academic Integrity Code is a communal expression of the importance of academic honesty and integrity. &nbsp;The Code, to which every student is required to subscribe, governs all activities involving the academic work of the student. &nbsp;The Code also governs the bases for evaluating intellectual achievement, written or oral, including examinations, quizzes, tests, themes, reports, recitations, and laboratory exercises. &nbsp;The Academic Integrity Code is printed in full in the Student Policy and Information Guide, and students and faculty should familiarize themselves with its provisions.</p>
<p><strong><span class="italic"><em>Adherence to the Policies of the Academic Integrity Code:</em> </span></strong></p>
<p align="justify">Muhlenberg College has established an Academic Integrity Code because of its belief that academic honesty is a matter of individual responsibility and that, when standards of honesty are violated, members of the community are harmed.&nbsp; As a prerequisite for matriculation each student must pledge to adhere to the provisions of this Academic Integrity Code. &nbsp;On all work submitted for a grade students shall write and sign the following pledge: "I pledge that I have complied with the Academic Integrity Code in this work." &nbsp;Some faculty will accept "AIC". &nbsp;Violations of the Academic Integrity Code include, but are not limited to, cheating during examinations, plagiarism, collusion, false information, and helping or hindering others.</p>
<p align="justify">Each faculty member shall identify the procedures to be used for classroom examinations and other assignments in each course. &nbsp;<span class="italic"><em>It is against College policy for a faculty member to accept any work submitted for a grade without the student's signed Academic Integrity Code pledge.</em> </span></p>
<p align="justify">Class tests and final examinations should be proctored. &nbsp;Proctoring is defined as having a faculty member present in the room. &nbsp;Proctoring is the responsibility of the faculty member teaching the course but, in special situations, that responsibility may be delegated to faculty colleagues.</p>

        <p>Students in good academic standing may audit one course per semester with the approval of the instructor. Instructors must explicitly detail their expectations for students auditing their courses at the beginning of the semester, and students must seek the consent of their faculty advisor. Typically, students auditing a course are expected to complete all assignments and participate in class discussions but may not be required to submit written work or take exams. Students may change a course from audit (no course unit attempted) to a regular course unit basis or vice versa during the add/drop period with the approval of the instructor and the faculty advisor by completing an Audit Request form and submitting it to the Office of the Registrar. The student's transcript will list the audited course with a grade of "AU" if the student has satisfactorily completed the audit. If the student fails to fulfill the expectations of the audit, no notation will appear on the transcript. Because an audit carries no course credit, a student may register for up to 5.5 course units and audit a class in the same semester.</p>

        <p>The primary means of identification at Muhlenberg College is a randomly generated student identification number - a BergID. This nine-digit number, in the format "00-9999999", will always begin with "00" and will be used by Muhlenberg to keep track of educational records. It will be required as identification on forms, to enter the CapStone Online Student Information System, and to transact other business at the College. While disclosure of this number to authorized college personnel is necessary, the number is still a personal identifier and should be guarded against dissemination.</p>

        <p>While a student's application term and first term of enrollment will not change, his/her class year and expected date of graduation may change. Reclassification may occur routinely or be initiated at a student's request. Students having enough graduation units may request to graduate earlier than their current expected date of graduation. Conversely, students who do not have enough units to graduate will be notified by the Office of the Registrar of their revised expected date of graduation. Typically, the expected date of graduation and class year will be in agreement with one another. &nbsp;Class year may be changed at any time.

        <p>Meeting times for courses offered at Muhlenberg occur within the academic calendar and semester timeline set and passed by the faculty. Occasionally, faculty may wish to divide the work, meeting times, and credit between two semesters. In those cases, students will complete half the work in one semester and receive 0.5 units of credit and complete the remainder of the work in a second semester for 0.5 units. Only very rarely will a course be allowed to be registered in one semester when the work is spread over two semesters. Faculty will make this request to the Registrar, and it will only be permitted if at least half of the work is completed during the semester registered.</p>
<p>Occasionally, faculty may wish to divide the work and meeting times for a single course between a semester and a break that precedes or follows the semester. In these cases, at least 50% of the work will be completed during the semester registered. If the completion of the course occurs during the break after the semester registered, the student will receive an IP (In Progress) grade until such time as the course is finished. Instructors must complete the Request for an IP Grade prior to the beginning of the semester where the course will be registered.</p>

        <p align="justify">Muhlenberg College uses a course system (units) intended to emphasize the mastery of subject matter in contrast to the credit system that measures achievement in terms of time spent in class. A course as a unit of instruction may include a combination of lecture, discussion, recitation, computer work, group projects, and laboratory work. Courses scheduled for 150 minutes of classroom instruction each week also include additional instructional activities (e.g., supplemental workshops, attendance at campus lectures and performances, service learning, field work). The course is the entire learning experience, not merely the time spent in the classroom. &nbsp;Such an approach delegates to students greater responsibility for their own education and encourages active learning.</p>
<p align="justify">Each course unit is of equal value and should be considered the equivalent of 4 semester hours for conversion purposes. A full-time degree candidate is typically enrolled for 4 course units during a semester. Prior to fall 1989, all credit was expressed in semester hours.</p>

<p align="justify">Full-time, degree-seeking students who have completed at least 4 course units in good academic standing may enroll for up to two courses per semester at any one of the LVAIC member institutions (Cedar Crest College, DeSales University, Lafayette College, Lehigh University, and Moravian College). &nbsp;The student must obtain approvals from his or her faculty advisor. &nbsp;Courses must not be offered regularly by Muhlenberg College and must be within the bounds of a regular course load.</p>
<p align="justify">In the case of LVAIC courses, unlike other course transfers, both courses and grades will be treated as Muhlenberg courses for degree requirement and grade point average purposes. &nbsp;Additional information is available online through the Office of the Registrar and the LVAIC web site.&nbsp; Forms are available in the Office of the Registrar.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>How to Cross-Register </strong>- The student should register during the regular registration or add/drop period as scheduled at his or her home campus, following this procedure:</p>
<p>1. Students will go to the LVAIC web site to search for courses.</p>
<p>2. Students review the course offerings available for cross-registration and select a course to request.</p>
<p>3. After completing the Request for Cross-Registration form, the information is sent to the student's advisor who will approve or deny the request.</p>
<p>4. Advisor approved course requests will be sent to the student's home Registrar for any additional approvals.</p>
<p>5. If approved by the home Registrar, the information will be sent to the host Registrar for review.</p>
<p>6. Registration by the host school is dependent upon course availability and registration time lines.&nbsp; Students may not know the result of their request until the beginning of the semester.</p>

As applications for admission are received by the College, exceptional applicants are identified and invited to submit a separate Dana application. Invitees typically are near the top of their high school class, score 1350 (Critical Reading and Math) or greater on the Scholastic Aptitude Test, and, equally important, exhibit distinctive creativity, versatility, and intellectual curiosity. In addition, invitees demonstrate a potential for civic engagement and leadership. &nbsp;Each Dana student receives a $4,000 annual stipend.</p>
<p align="justify">The Dana Program emphasizes creativity and independence of thought through Independent Study and Research. After completing the Dana First-Year seminar, students will complete 3 other Dana course units: 1 unit of Dana Directed Studies, 1 unit of Dana Internship, and 1 unit of the Dana Forum. All Dana students must complete the Dana Forum - a capstone experience in their Senior year.</p>
<p align="justify">Dana Program participants may major in any field of study offered at Muhlenberg. At the discretion of the major department, certain components of the program may be applied toward major requirements.</p>
<p align="justify">Dana Scholars need to maintain a GPA of at least 3.33. Students who successfully complete the Dana Scholars Program are honored by receiving the designation "Dana Scholar" on their diploma and transcript. See Dr. Mohsin Hashim for additional information.</p>

        <p align="justify">The Degree Audit is a computer program that reviews past and current student coursework and matches the courses with the requirements of his/her degree program or anticipated program, including units needed to graduate and GPA information. It will show how the student&rsquo;s courses have been applied toward the degree and which courses the student still needs to complete. The audit is divided into sections such as Major, Minor, and General Academic Requirements and will audit major one, major two, minor one, minor two, and GARs. If the student has not yet declared a major or minor, only the GARs will be audited.</p>
<p>Audits are available for anyone who has enrolled for credit as a Muhlenberg student beginning Fall 2012 or later and has at least one graded semester record in Capstone. Students in their first semester will have an audit that shows how the courses currently "in progress" will apply toward their degree.</p>
<p>In addition to monitoring what the student has taken, the audit may also answer &ldquo;What-if&rdquo; questions. "What-if" I declare an additional major or change my major. The &ldquo;What-if&rdquo; degree audit will apply completed course work to new majors/minors and show how the requirements for graduation will change based on this new major/minor. It is helpful for students who are exploring majors/minors and for those considering a second major. "What-if" can also be used to show how specific courses may be used toward a degree.</p>
<p>Toward the end of each audit is a "Not Used" section. This list shows courses that were not used to fulfill a specific major/minor/gar requirement. &nbsp;These are used to fulfill units required toward graduation. If there is a course in the "Not Used" section that should be applied toward a specific requirement, the Registrar's Office should be notified, usually through a department variance request.</p>
<p>An audit is an up-to-the-minute outline of courses needed to meet degree, major, and minor requirements. This information should be used to discuss plans with the student&rsquo;s academic adviser. If the audit identifies unfulfilled requirements, there are often several alternatives for satisfying these requirements. The student and adviser should discuss which courses to schedule based on the student&rsquo;s abilities, interests, and plans. Advising may also be helpful in determining the best combination of courses to schedule each semester in order to meet requirements.</p>
<p>In addition to indicating how courses were used toward the student's degree, it will also list cumulative and major or minor GPAs.</p>
<p>The degree audit is not the student&rsquo;s official College academic record. &nbsp;The transcript is the official record of completed work. The degree audit is a tool to provide students with academic information related to degree progress. It displays courses required and completed in the degree program. The transcript is the official academic record and provides a chronological list of courses completed and other academic information.</p>
<p align="justify">Students should direct questions concerning a degree audit to the Office of the Registrar immediately. The student is responsible for knowing and meeting degree requirements.&nbsp;</p>

        <p align="justify">Muhlenberg College is committed to ensuring that all qualified students with disabilities are provided reasonable accommodations, auxiliary aids, and services to ensure full access to programs, services, and activities. Students with disabilities who are the most successful at the post-secondary level are those who are appropriately qualified and prepared for independent academic study, have full knowledge of the impact of their disability, and who demonstrate well-developed self-advocacy skills.</p>
<p align="justify">The criteria for eligibility at postsecondary institutions are different than those used for eligibility determination in the K-12 arena. Under the ADA 1990, a disability is defined as "a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities, or having a record of such an impairment, or being regarded as having such an impairment". Disability Documentation submitted to obtain accommodations, auxiliary aids, and services at the postsecondary level must identify the disability, provide evidence of the disability's impact on the major life activity, and suggest recommendations for accommodations.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="justify">At the postsecondary level it is the student's responsibility to disclose his/her disability, to request academic adjustments, and to follow established procedures for requesting those accommodations. Muhlenberg College students with disabilities who request accommodations, auxiliary aids, and services are encouraged to identify these needs to the Office of Disability Services as soon as possible after their application to the College has been accepted and their decision to attend has been confirmed. &nbsp;Submission of current, detailed documentation of the student's disability with a completed Disability Disclosure Document is required in order to process requests. &nbsp;(Preferably, before the advising period in June.)</p>
<p align="justify">The Office of Disability Services will review submitted documentation, including the completed Disability Disclosure Document, and will consult with the appropriate campus professionals for further action. The student will be invited to discuss the disclosed disability and the requested accommodations, auxiliary aids, and services with the designated campus departments that include the Academic Resource Center, Student Health Services, and Counseling Services.</p>
<p align="justify">Students with documented disabilities may receive approval for reasonable accommodations to address their particular needs. Accommodations are determined on a case-by-case basis and must be requested by the student each semester.</p>
<p align="justify">After the point of documentation and disclosure, it is the student's responsibility to begin a working relationship with his/her instructor by providing a letter of recommended accommodations from the appropriate college office. The student should then meet with each faculty member and describe how the disability will impact the course in question.</p>
<p align="justify">It is very important for students to work closely with faculty members when the disability impacts coursework. They are valuable resources and can usually help the student navigate the course requirements more efficiently.</p>
<p align="justify">For further information refer to the Students with Disabilities web page at <a href="http://www.muhlenberg.edu/main/aboutus/disabilities/"><strong>www.muhlenberg.edu/main/aboutus/disabilities</strong></a>.</p>

<p align="justify">No course may be withdrawn after the 45<sup>th</sup> day of a semester, except for medical reasons certified by the Executive Director of Health and Counseling Services. &nbsp;If a student stops attending a course and does not process the appropriate form, a grade of "F" will be assigned. &nbsp;</p>
<p align="justify">A student who does not attend the first meeting of a course <em><span class="italic">may </span></em> be dropped from the roster in order to make room for students waiting to register for the course. &nbsp;The professor must provide the Registrar with the names of any student dropped from his or her course as a result of this policy.</p>
<p align="justify">Non-attendance on the first day of classes does not mean that a student is automatically dropped from a course. &nbsp;Non-attendance drops will be processed only at the instructor's request.&nbsp; It is the student's responsibility to make sure his or her registration of courses is accurate.</p>
<p align="justify">All students are responsible for their own enrollment. &nbsp;Failure to properly add, drop, or withdraw from a course may result in no course units awarded and/or a failing grade.</p>

<li>
<p>The right to inspect and review their education records within forty-five (45) days of the day an appropriate College official receives a written request for access.</p>

<li>
<p>The right to<span class="content-add05"> request the amendment of education records that the student believes are inaccurate or misleading. &nbsp;</span>The College must provide reasonable accommodations to accomplish these tasks. &nbsp;The office that creates and maintains the record in question is responsible for determining what is reasonable.</p>

        <p>Except for independent study, independent research, internships, physical education, and applied music, a final evaluation is required for all courses. &nbsp;An instructor may arrange to use a final examination or some other means of evaluation. &nbsp;The final examination schedule for a term will be available on the web approximately four weeks after the start of classes. &nbsp;Faculty are not allowed to change either the date or time of a final examination. &nbsp;These requests must go through the Provost.</p>
<p>Two final examinations scheduled at the same time or three in one day constitute a conflict for the student. &nbsp;In order for a makeup examination to be given, a conflict must be filed in the Office of the Registrar by the date indicated on the semester calendar. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Means of assessing a student's efforts and progress should be assigned periodically throughout a semester by the faculty member teaching the course. &nbsp;Any test or exercise that is to count more than the value of a regular class exercise should be announced at least two weeks in advance. &nbsp;Typically, the final examination should not count for more than 50% of the course grade. &nbsp;Final examinations and other graded materials, if not returned to the student in some manner that insures receipt by the student, should be kept on file by the instructor until the end of the semester following that for which the material was submitted.</p>
<p>All faculty, staff, and students must be available until the semester concludes (the last day with College scheduled final exams) at 3:00 p.m. each semester.<strong> <br /></strong></p>

        <p class="style2">First-Year Seminars are small, discussion-oriented courses that provide entering students with the opportunity to work closely with a faculty member. Required of all first-year students and typically limited to an enrollment of 15, First-Year Seminars promote intellectual discussion and critical thinking, reading, and writing skills. Offered by faculty members from departments throughout the College, the seminars share an emphasis on closer reading and thinking critically about the values and assumptions underlying various approaches to knowledge.</p>
<p class="style2">Primarily concerned with developing critical thinking, reading, and writing, First-Year Seminars are writing-intensive. Evaluation will be based on students' writing rather than on examinations. The seminars will teach participants how to formulate a thesis and how to collect, evaluate, and cite evidence that supports and qualifies this thesis. They will teach participants what an argument, analysis, or interpretation is and will give students practice in constructing and evaluating sound ones. Students will also learn how to revise their work, rethinking their ideas with the help of the instructor's comments on preliminary drafts. In sum, First-Year Seminars introduce students to the life of the mind - to what it means to think deeply and to talk and write critically about ideas; they model and encourage students to participate in thoughtful, critical, and intellectual reflection and conversation.</p>
<p class="style2">First-Year Seminars are registered during June Advising. Although choice of seminar cannot be guaranteed, it is considered in combination with the student's other courses and space available. The student is mailed instructional material on how to access the fall schedule through Capstone Online in mid-July. Review of the schedule of courses will inform the student of the seminar that is registered. The seminar group forms the student's advising group, and the instructor of the seminar is usually the student's advisor. That advisor remains the faculty advisor until the student declares his/her major.</p>

        <p>Students who have not been granted advanced standing and who need to continue a language must take a placement examination before registering in June. The results of the examination will determine the appropriate course assignment. Students seeking exemption from the foreign language requirement must take an exemption examination during the fall semester orientation period. Students who can demonstrate a native command of a language other than English may apply to the Chair of Languages, Literatures, and Cultures for permission to use that language to satisfy the foreign language requirement. Students will demonstrate competence through testing in four areas: listening, reading, speaking, and writing. See also&nbsp;<strong>Achievement Tests.</strong></p>

        <p>Muhlenberg College general academic requirements are designed to furnish the student with the theoretical and practical knowledge that an educated person should possess, regardless of personal career goals. Such knowledge includes an understanding of the major fields of learning; an ability to express oneself clearly and cogently; an understanding of the values found in religious traditions and philosophical reflection; an understanding of epochs, languages, and cultures other than one's own; and above all, an ability to see issues from many sides, to question what is taken for granted, and to view particular events in relation to their larger contexts. The Muhlenberg College curriculum provides opportunities for exploring and integrating ideas while challenging students to question, discuss, and think critically about their own beliefs and values. By fostering such skills and perspectives, a Muhlenberg education seeks to provide the student with the insight and flexibility needed to meet the challenges of the future. &nbsp;</p>

        <p><strong>I. ACADEMIC SKILLS</strong><br /><br />Effective writing and reasoning are important in all academic disciplines and are hallmarks of the educated person.&nbsp; The development and utilization of these skills will be evident in courses throughout the curriculum.&nbsp; Students are also required to have some knowledge of a language other than English&mdash;a skill which helps in understanding the structure of language as well as providing access to another culture.&nbsp; Requirements have been established so that all students may have the opportunity to achieve competency in these skills early in their college experience.<br /><br /><strong>First-Year Seminars (FY) &nbsp;</strong>Small, discussion-oriented courses that focus on the development of effective thinking, writing, and speaking skills.&nbsp; In the concentration on writing, emphasis is placed on the formulation of thesis, critical use of evidence, and processes of revision.&nbsp; All students are required to complete a First-Year Seminar. <br /><br /><strong>Writing (W)</strong> Competency in writing&nbsp; clear&nbsp; and&nbsp; cogent expository prose.&nbsp; Required:&nbsp; First-Year Seminar and two additional writing intensive courses; one of these must be a course designated by the major department.<br /><br /><strong>Language (FL)</strong> The development of the basic skills of language acquisition and usage such as understanding grammatical structure, oral-aural ability, reading comprehension, and writing ability as well as an introduction to the cultural aspects of language study.&nbsp; Required:&nbsp; two courses in the same language OR proficiency adequate to prepare students for the Conversation &amp; Composition course (301, 302) in the language.&nbsp; Students are encouraged to complete the language requirement by the end of the sophomore year.&nbsp; Initial placement in language study at Muhlenberg is dependent upon experience and placement test results as recommended by the Department of Languages, Literatures, and Cultures.<br /><br /><strong>Reasoning (RG) &nbsp;</strong>The ability to understand and utilize mathematical and/or logical relationships, to analyze data, to construct and assess arguments, and to make sound judgments.&nbsp; A course used to fulfill the Reasoning requirement may not be double counted for a distribution requirement.&nbsp; Required:&nbsp; one course.&nbsp; Students are encourage to complete the reasoning requirement no later than the end of the sophomore year.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><strong>II. INTELLECTUAL BREADTH</strong><br /><br />The following requirements provide some degree of breadth in the academic experience of all students.&nbsp; Courses meeting distribution designations will introduce students to the different types of assumptions, questions, ways of understanding, and results that characterize various fields of inquiry in the liberal arts.&nbsp; Within a distribution area each course satisfying that area requirement must have a different prefix.&nbsp; A maximum of two courses required for the major may be used to satisfy a distribution requirement. <br /><br />Departments listed with a distribution area below will generally offer courses with that designation, although there may be certain instances where the department may offer a course in another distribution area.&nbsp; Interdisciplinary Programs that offer a course(s) within a distribution area are listed as well.&nbsp; Because the nature of interdisciplinary programs is to span several academic areas, an Interdisciplinary Program may be listed in more than one distribution area.<br /><br /><strong>Arts (AR)</strong> <em>one course</em>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />Students develop the technical skills, problem-solving ability, judgment, and courage necessary to create new work in the visual, performing, and literary arts, together with the knowledge of the theory, history, and social context of artistic practice. &nbsp;While typically&nbsp;all general academic requirements must be met with one-unit courses, in the case of dance techniques and applied music courses two .5 unit courses may be used satisfy the Fine Arts requirement as shown below.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Two &frac12; unit dance technique courses enrolled in a single term OR<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two &frac12; unit Individual or Class Applied Music courses in the same instrument.</p>
<p>Departments and Programs:&nbsp; Art, Music, Theatre, Dance, and Creative Writing and Film Studies&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Humanities (HU)</strong> <em>three courses with different prefixes</em><br />Students interpret and evaluate issues of human concern, experience, and expression by means of analysis, critical reasoning, and historical reflection.&nbsp; They cultivate knowledge and understanding of human activity and world views across time, geography, and culture.</p>
<p>Departments and Programs: English; History; Languages, Literatures, and Cultures; Philosophy; Religion Studies; and American Studies; Film Studies; and Jewish Studies&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

They use quantitative and scientific problem solving skills to investigate natural phenomena.</p>
<p>Departments and Programs:&nbsp; Biology, Chemistry, Mathematics and Computer Science, Physics, and Environmental Science, Neuroscience, and Sustainability Studies<br /><br /><strong>Social&nbsp;&nbsp; Sciences&nbsp;&nbsp; (SL)&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> <em>two&nbsp; courses&nbsp; with&nbsp; different prefixes</em>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />Students investigate how modern institutional structures and social, political, economic and cultural practices shape and are shaped by individual choices, group behavior, and public policies. Students develop an understanding of the operations of power and ideology across social contexts, relationships, and practices.</p>
<p>Departments and Programs:&nbsp; Accounting, Business, Economics, and Finance; Education; Media and Communication; Political Science; Psychology; Sociology and Anthropology; and International Studies<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><strong>III. EXPLORATION AND INTEGRATION</strong><br /><br />Muhlenberg College is committed to the interdisciplinary exploration and integration of ideas throughout the four years of undergraduate education. &nbsp;We strive to enable our students to make connections between various areas of knowledge and approaches to inquiry, to prepare for life as global citizens, and to integrate what they are learning in their major with their broad educational experience at Muhlenberg.<br /><br /><strong>Cluster Courses (CL)</strong>&nbsp;<em>two directly linked courses with different prefixes</em>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> Students must enroll in two courses with different prefixes that form an integrated cluster. The courses will focus on a shared area of interest, theme, or question, examining it from the perspective of each discipline. Clustered courses may double count for distribution and HDGE requirements (see below).<br /><br /><strong>Human Difference and Global Engagement (DE)</strong> <em>two courses</em>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> Students must take two designated courses in the areas of Human Difference and Global Engagement. HDGE courses across the curriculum aim to broaden and deepen students&rsquo; understanding of human difference and to develop the intellectual and civic skills students require for participation in an increasingly diverse and interconnected world. HDGE courses may double count for distribution and cluster requirements.<br /><br /><strong>Culminating Undergraduate Experience (CUE)</strong>&nbsp; <em>one credit-bearing course or an assignment embedded within a credit-bearing course</em>: <br /> Culminating Undergraduate Experiences (CUEs) are the capstone experience in a major and provide the opportunity for students to clarify their relationship to a discipline, demonstrate their mastery of content, reflect on accumulated content and experiences, and open new paths for the future. They are required for all majors offered by departments and programs at Muhlenberg College and are the purview of the departments and programs.<br /><br /><strong>IV. PHYSICAL EDUCATION</strong><br /><br />Courses in physical education are designed to promote an understanding of the elements of physical well being. All students are required to successfully complete Principles of Fitness &amp; Wellness which is a semester long course exploring the dimensions of wellness and the health-related components of fitness.&nbsp; Students are strongly encouraged to complete the physical education requirement no later than the end of the sophomore year.</p>

        <p><strong>I. ACADEMIC SKILLS</strong><br /><br />Effective writing and reasoning are important in all academic disciplines and are hallmarks of the educated person.&nbsp; The development and utilization of these skills will be evident in courses throughout the curriculum.&nbsp; Students are also required to have some knowledge of a language other than English&mdash;a skill which helps in understanding the structure of language as well as providing access to another culture.&nbsp; Requirements have been established so that all students may have the opportunity to achieve competency in these skills early in their college experience.<br /><br /><span><strong>First-Year Seminars (FY)</strong> </span>Small, discussion-oriented courses that focus on the development of effective thinking, writing, and speaking skills.&nbsp; In the concentration on writing, emphasis is placed on the formulation of thesis, critical use of evidence, and processes of revision.&nbsp; All students are required to complete a First-Year Seminar.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Writing (W)</strong>&nbsp;Competency in writing&nbsp; clear&nbsp; and&nbsp; cogent expository prose.&nbsp; Required:&nbsp; First-Year Seminar and two additional writing intensive courses; one of these must be a course designated by the major department.<br /><br /><strong>Language (FL)</strong>&nbsp;The development of the basic skills of language acquisition and usage such as understanding grammatical structure, oral-aural ability, reading comprehension, and writing ability as well as an introduction to the cultural aspects of language study.&nbsp; Required:&nbsp; two courses in the same language OR proficiency adequate to prepare students for the Conversation &amp; Composition course (301, 302) in the language.&nbsp; Students are encouraged to complete the language requirement by the end of the sophomore year.&nbsp; Initial placement in language study at Muhlenberg is dependent upon experience and placement test results as recommended by the Department of Languages, Literatures, and Cultures.<br /><br /><span><strong>Reasoning (RG)</strong>&nbsp;</span>The ability to understand and utilize mathematical and/or logical relationships, to analyze data, to construct and assess arguments, and to make sound judgments.&nbsp; A course used to fulfill the Reasoning requirement may not be double counted for a distribution requirement.&nbsp; Required:&nbsp; one course.&nbsp; Students are encourage to complete the reasoning requirement no later than the end of the sophomore year.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><strong>II. INTELLECTUAL BREADTH</strong><br /><br />The following requirements provide some degree of breadth in the academic experience of all students.&nbsp; Courses meeting distribution designations will introduce students to the different types of assumptions, questions, ways of understanding, and results that characterize various fields of inquiry in the liberal arts.&nbsp; Within a distribution area each course satisfying that area requirement must have a different prefix.&nbsp; A maximum of two courses required for the major may be used to satisfy a distribution requirement.&nbsp;<br /><br />Departments listed with a distribution area below will generally offer courses with that designation, although there may be certain instances where the department may offer a course in another distribution area.&nbsp; Interdisciplinary Programs that offer a course(s) within a distribution area are listed as well.&nbsp; Because the nature of interdisciplinary programs is to span several academic areas, an Interdisciplinary Program may be listed in more than one distribution area.<br /><br /><strong>Arts (AR)</strong>&nbsp;<em>one course</em>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Students develop the technical skills, problem-solving ability, judgment, and courage necessary to create new work in the visual, performing, and literary arts, together with the knowledge of the theory, history, and social context of artistic practice. &nbsp;While typically&nbsp;all general academic requirements must be met with one-unit courses, in the case of dance techniques and applied music courses two .5 unit courses may be used satisfy the Fine Arts requirement as shown below.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Two &frac12; unit dance technique courses enrolled in a single term OR<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two &frac12; unit Individual or Class Applied Music courses in the same instrument.</p>
<p>Departments and Programs:&nbsp; Art, Music, Theatre, Dance, and Creative Writing and Film Studies&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Humanities (HU)</strong>&nbsp;<em>three courses with different prefixes</em><br />Students interpret and evaluate issues of human concern, experience, and expression by means of analysis, critical reasoning, and historical reflection.&nbsp; They cultivate knowledge and understanding of human activity and world views across time, geography, and culture.</p>
<p>Departments and Programs: English; History; Languages, Literatures, and Cultures; Philosophy; Religion Studies; and American Studies; Film Studies; and Jewish Studies&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

They use quantitative and scientific problem solving skills to investigate natural phenomena.</p>
<p>Departments and Programs:&nbsp; Biology, Chemistry, Mathematics and Computer Science, Physics, and Environmental Science, Neuroscience, and Sustainability Studies<br /><br /><span><strong>Social Sciences (SL)</strong>&nbsp;</span><em>two&nbsp; courses&nbsp; with&nbsp; different prefixes</em>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Students investigate how modern institutional structures and social, political, economic and cultural practices shape and are shaped by individual choices, group behavior, and public policies. Students develop an understanding of the operations of power and ideology across social contexts, relationships, and practices.</p>
<p>Departments and Programs:&nbsp; Accounting, Business, Economics, and Finance; Education; Media and Communication; Political Science; Psychology; Sociology and Anthropology; and International Studies<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><strong>III. EXPLORATION AND INTEGRATION</strong><br /><br />Muhlenberg College is committed to the interdisciplinary exploration and integration of ideas throughout the four years of undergraduate education. &nbsp;We strive to enable our students to make connections between various areas of knowledge and approaches to inquiry, to prepare for life as global citizens, and to integrate what they are learning in their major with their broad educational experience at Muhlenberg.<br /><br /><strong>Integrative Learning (IL):</strong> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Students must enroll in one designated Integrative Learning experience. &nbsp;These experiences emphasize making connections that combine disparate disciplinary, methodological, ideological, or epistemological perspectives; entail applying multiple ways of knowing to concepts and experiences; and empower students to recognize and solve problems, address existing questions, and ask new ones in more comprehensive ways. &nbsp;The Integrative Learning curricular requirement provides opportunities for intentionally cultivating this way of thinking in collaborative environments and communities.<br /><br /><strong>Human Difference and Global Engagement (DE)</strong>&nbsp;<em>two courses</em>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Students must take two designated courses in the areas of Human Difference and Global Engagement. HDGE courses across the curriculum aim to broaden and deepen students&rsquo; understanding of human difference and to develop the intellectual and civic skills students require for participation in an increasingly diverse and interconnected world. HDGE courses may double count for distribution and cluster requirements.<br /><br /><strong>Culminating Undergraduate Experience (CUE)</strong>&nbsp;<em>one credit-bearing course or an assignment embedded within a credit-bearing course</em>:&nbsp;<br />Culminating Undergraduate Experiences (CUEs) are the capstone experience in a major and provide the opportunity for students to clarify their relationship to a discipline, demonstrate their mastery of content, reflect on accumulated content and experiences, and open new paths for the future. They are required for all majors offered by departments and programs at Muhlenberg College and are the purview of the departments and programs.<br /><br /><strong>IV. PHYSICAL EDUCATION</strong><br /><br />Courses in physical education are designed to promote an understanding of the elements of physical well being. All students are required to successfully complete Principles of Fitness &amp; Wellness which is a semester long course exploring the dimensions of wellness and the health-related components of fitness.&nbsp; Students are strongly encouraged to complete the physical education requirement no later than the end of the sophomore year.</p>

        <p>Only the instructor issuing the original grade may change a grade. Once a grade has been submitted, an instructor cannot verbally communicate a grade change to the Registrar. The instructor must complete a Change of Grade form with the student's new grade, either online or via a paper change of grade form, and the reason for the grade change. After the change the student will be able to review the revised grade on Capstone Online.</p>
<p>Students are expected to request a review of academic progress during the semester in which a course runs. If the final grade is in question, a student is expected to request a review within a reasonable time period after grades have been posted, not to exceed 60 days of the end of the semester or end of an extension, if an Incomplete was granted. This will foster an environment of a timely resolution and prevent issues from arising semesters or years after a grade has been posted.</p>
<p>Once a semester has been completed and a student has been awarded a final grade (not an Incomplete or In Progress grade), the student is not allowed to turn in additional work, extra credit work, or work that was required earlier in the semester in order to raise the grade. Students may always request that a faculty member review previous work which determined the final grade, but no new work can be submitted once a final grade has been submitted. If, before final grades are posted, the faculty member and student agree that additional work can be submitted, the student should be granted an Incomplete in accordance with the Incomplete Policy.</p>

        <p>Any student may initiate a request to review academic progress with a faculty member in whose class s/he is currently enrolled or has been recently enrolled. Sometimes that progress is linked to a grade; sometimes not. Muhlenberg recognizes the centrality of the faculty member in determining course content and criteria for evaluation of student performance in a course.<br /><br />Muhlenberg College has a protocol by which students have ample opportunity to have conversations about academic work and grades; it is not a formal appeals procedure. The student speaks with the professor of the class. Most conversations end at this point since there is a mutual understanding of the academic work and standards for evaluation. In some instances, the student may wish to consult with the department chair after a conversation with the faculty member in order to seek further clarification.<br /><br />Students are expected to request a review of academic progress during the semester in which a course runs. If the final grade is in question, a student is expected to request a review within a reasonable time period after grades have been posted, not to exceed 60 days of the end of the semester or end of an extension, if an Incomplete was granted. This will foster an environment of a timely resolution and prevent issues from arising semesters or years after a grade has been posted.</p>

        <p>All Muhlenberg College students who have successfully completed 34 course units and all other requirements for the degree may graduate and receive their diploma in January, May, or October. Students graduating in May will receive their diploma in May and participate in the May ceremony. A student who graduates in January or October will receive their diploma during the respective graduation month and may choose to participate in the May ceremony. A student may only participate in a ceremony once. &nbsp;Wescoe Degree Completion students receive their diploma in October and participate in an October ceremony.<br /><br />Periodically during the year, the Office of the Registrar conducts a review for each senior who has applied to graduate. A senior who will not meet the requirements stated for participation in Commencement will be notified that s/he has been removed from the list of graduating seniors. Seniors should be cautious about changing registration in the last semester of the senior year. Any change that brings a senior below the stated requirements for participation will result in the student being dropped from the graduating class. Any senior unable to complete the requirements and graduate in May will be notified by the Office of the Registrar and reclassified to either October, January, or the following May graduation.</p>
<p><strong>Graduation Attire</strong><br /><br />1. Cap, gown, hood, and tassel<br /><br />2.

        <p>Established in 1776 at the College of William and Mary, Phi Beta Kappa is a distinguished fellowship of scholars devoted to liberal education and intellectual pursuits. The Muhlenberg chapter was granted a charter by the national honor society in 1967. Based on national standards, election to Phi Beta Kappa represents the most outstanding academic achievement in the arts and sciences.<br /><br />In 2008, Alpha Sigma Lambda, the premier Honor Society for Nontraditional Students chartered the Muhlenberg College chapter, Eta Chi. &Alpha;&Sigma;&Lambda; was established in 1945 at Northwestern University to recognize the special achievements of adults who accomplish academic excellence, while facing competing interests of family, community, and work.<br /><br />Muhlenberg has chapters of honor societies and recognition societies in many academic disciplines. Honor societies include Omicron Delta Epsilon (Economics), Omicron Delta Kappa (Leadership), Phi Alpha Theta (History), Phi Sigma Iota (Romance Languages), Phi Sigma Tau (Philosophy), Pi Mu Epsilon (Mathematics), Pi Sigma Alpha (Political Science), Psi Chi (Psychology), Theta Alpha Kappa (Religious Studies and Theology). Recognition societies include Delta Phi Alpha (German), Dobro Slovo (Slavic Studies). Phi Sigma Tan, the national Philosophy honor society, was founded at Muhlenberg in 1930. Muhlenberg College also maintains a chapter of Alpha Phi Omega, a national service fraternity.</p>

        <p>1. In order to be allowed to award the IP grade, an instructor/department must send this &nbsp;request to the Curriculum Committee and offer a rationale for why the course would need to extend beyond the end of one semester. &nbsp;They also need to indicate an end date by which the course will finish and the student(s) will have completed work, as well as indicate the date by which grades will be submitted to the Registrar.<br /><br />2. Instructor/department will also need to provide an alternate plan in the event of unforeseen circumstances (e.g. the cancellation of a study abroad trip due to illness or State Department warnings). The contingency plan should include: (1) the date by which the contingency plan goes into effect; (2) the completion date for the revised course; (3) the date by which grades will be sent to the Registrar.<br /><br />3.&nbsp; If over 50% of the course occurs in one semester, students will only register for one course during the semester where the majority of the work is completed. For courses where the material is evenly split between two semesters, students will register for two courses, one in each semester.<br /><br />4. At the completion of the semester, the students will be awarded an IP grade. Following the completion of the course, the instructor will submit a final grade which will replace the IP. If the course extends to two semesters, the first semester grade will be recorded as an IP. When the second semester is completed, the final grade will be appended to the courses for both semesters.<br /><br />5.&nbsp; Regardless of the length of the course, the standard add/drop and withdrawal deadlines in effect for the semester, will be followed.<br /><br />6.&nbsp; For courses that span two semesters:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i. Students who do not register for the second semester would receive a &ldquo;W&rdquo; grade for the first semester.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ii. Students will be able to withdraw from the first semester course until the withdrawal deadline for that semester. After such a withdrawal, the second course will be dropped if the student is registered for it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; iii. Students will be able to withdraw from the second semester course until the withdrawal deadline for that semester. Students withdrawing during the second semester would receive a W grade for both semesters.<br /><br />7. Students who do not complete course requirements by the time grades are to be submitted to the Registrar must follow the regular procedures if they wish to have their grade converted to an Incomplete.</p>

        <p>All requests for incomplete grades must be made directly by the student to his or her faculty member for the relevant course and must specify a compelling reason or reasons for failure to complete the course requirements. Except in extraordinary circumstances, all such requests must be submitted by the last day of class for the term. &nbsp;Only faculty members are authorized to grant incomplete grades and no incomplete grade may be given to any student who has not requested one. In addition, certain courses based primarily on student participation or performance (i.e. dance, science labs, student teaching, foreign languages, etc.) are different in nature from courses based primarily on lectures and reading. It may not be feasible for a faculty member to grant an incomplete grade for such student participation/performance based courses and, accordingly, such student participation/performance based courses may not be eligible for an incomplete grade under this Policy. Faculty members shall advise students at the beginning of each semester whether or not a particular student participation/performance based course is eligible for an incomplete grade under this Policy.<br><br>If the student specifies the involvement of a medical or mental health issue as the compelling reason for the request for an incomplete grade, the faculty member should consult with the Executive Director of Health and Counseling Services, who shall provide verification of the medical or mental health issue to the faculty member. If the student requesting an incomplete grade has sought medical or mental health services off-campus, the student must obtain appropriate documentation from his or her health service provider and arrange for this documentation to be presented to the Executive Director of Health and Counseling Services who shall then review the documentation and provide verification of the medical or mental health issue to the faculty member. The existence of a medical or mental health issue will not automatically result in an incomplete grade.&nbsp; Rather, the faculty member, after consultation with the Executive Director of Health and Counseling Services, will determine whether or not the medical or mental health issue constitutes a compelling reason for the requested incomplete grade.<br><br>In the event that the faculty member denies a student's request for an incomplete grade, the student may, within five (5) days after the student receives notice of the denial, contact the Office of the Dean of Academic Life to submit a written appeal of the faculty member's denial in accordance with guidelines established by the Dean of Academic Life. Upon receipt of a written appeal, the Dean of Academic Life shall review the appeal and, as applicable and appropriate, consult with parties such as the student, the faculty member, the Executive Director of Health and&nbsp; Counseling Services, or other campus professionals. Thereafter, the Dean of Academic Life shall affirm or reverse the determination of the faculty member and so notify the student and the faculty member. No appeals from the decision of the Dean of Academic Life shall be permitted.</p>
<p>Once a semester has been completed and a student has been awarded a final grade (not an Incomplete or In Progress grade), the student is not allowed to turn in additional work, extra credit work, or work that was required earlier in the semester in order to raise the grade. Students may always request that a faculty member review previous work which determined the final grade, but no new work can be submitted once a final grade has been submitted. If, before final grades are posted, the faculty member and student agree that additional work can be submitted, the student should be granted an Incomplete in accordance with the Incomplete Policy.</p>
<p>In the event that an incomplete grade is granted, the faculty member will typically put in writing the required work to be done and the deadline for submission. A Change of Grade must be submitted to the Registrar’s Office within thirty-five (35) calendar days after the date final grades were due. If the student fails to produce completed work so that a Change of Grade is not submitted within the thirty-five (35) calendar day period, the incomplete will convert to a grade of F. However, if the student, within the thirty-five (35) calendar day period, presents a compelling reason for failure to timely complete the work, an extension of time to complete the required work may be granted by the faculty member. Extensions for other than medical or mental health reasons may be made at the discretion of the faculty member following consultation with the Dean of Academic Life. Extensions based on medical or mental health reasons must follow the procedures set forth above.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, a student with more than two pending incomplete grades will not be permitted to begin a new academic term, even if the subsequent semester begins within the thirty-five (35) calendar day period. For example, if the spring semester begins 28 days after the day final grades were due from the fall semester, and the student has three or more incomplete grades where work has not yet been submitted by the beginning of classes, the student may not return for the spring semester.</p>

        <p>No more than a total of 4 course units may be earned through any type of individualized instruction to meet the course unit degree requirement except as required by special programs. No internship, practicum, or independent study/research course may be used to satisfy a general academic requirement. Approval of the appropriate department chair, academic advisor, and a faculty sponsor are required for all internships, practica, and independent study/research courses.<br><br>Students may enroll only one internship or practicum during a term except for internships taken as part of approved programs such as the Semester in Washington D.C., Dana Scholars, and study abroad. Students may enroll for more than one independent study/research course during a term, but only one independent study/research course may be taken concurrently with an internship or practicum. Students participating in special programs, such as the Washington Semester or study abroad, are exempt from term-based enrollment limits on internships, practica, or independent study/research courses.</p>
<p><strong>Independent Study/Research</strong><br><br>An independent study/research course can vary by academic department or discipline. It may be a student-inspired and student-initiated project or a faculty-directed research project. Each independent study/research course is to be designed in consultation with the faculty sponsor and usually does not cover the same material as or material similar to that covered in regularly offered courses. For student-inspired and student-initiated independent study/research courses the student must submit a detailed proposal to the faculty sponsor before registering for the independent study/research. Typically, no more than one course unit is awarded for each independent study/research course, and no fewer than 9-12 hours of work per week (Fall/Spring) or 126-168 hours per semester (Fall/Spring/Summer) are required for each course unit earned.<br><br>Independent study/research courses must have assigned letter grades, A through F, and must be registered by the add/drop deadline of the semester in which they are recorded. A learning contract will describe the goals of all independent study/research courses and specify what work the student will do. Course units for independent study/research cannot be awarded retroactively.<br><br><strong>Internships and Practica</strong><br><br>An internship is work experience undertaken for the purpose of learning in which the student assumes a responsible role in an organization and actively reflects on what he or she is doing and observing. A practicum is an internship required by a major. Internships and practica are limited to full-time, degree-seeking students who have completed at least 16 course units in good academic standing or students enrolled through the Wescoe School.<br><br>Each internship and practicum is to be designed in consultation with a faculty sponsor and an on-site supervisor and will include an academic project to be defined by the student, in consultation with the faculty sponsor, and submitted to the faculty sponsor for evaluation. This academic project may be written or presented, at the discretion of the faculty sponsor. Typically, no more than one course unit is awarded for each internship or practicum, and no fewer than 9-12 hours of work per week (Fall/Spring) or 126-168 hours per semester (Fall/Spring/Summer) are required for each course unit earned.<br><br>Typically, an internship site may not be repeated unless the responsibilities are approved by the faculty sponsor. No internship may take place at the same site for more than two units. Students are expected to avoid conflicts of interest, such as direct supervision by a parent or supervision by someone who reports to or is a close colleague of a family member.<br><br>For all internships and practica the faculty sponsor must explicitly detail his or her expectations for the student as early as possible in planning the experience. This learning contract describes the goals and what work will be done for each internship or practicum.<br><br>Internships and practica must be registered by the end of the third week of the term in which the work is recorded. For the summer term, internships and practica must be registered no later than a date listed in the summer academic calendar. The student will be billed for the credit earned. Internships taken during the summer for a Muhlenbeg course unit will be subject to the tuition cost of one course unit.<br><br>The deadline for submitting final grades for internships and practica is that term's deadline for final grades. The course units for internships and practica cannot be awarded retroactively.<br><br>The internship or practicum on-site supervisor will submit a written evaluation of the student's work which the faculty sponsor will take into consideration when assigning a grade. The faculty sponsor typically evaluates a student's work in an individualized instruction course according to standards at least as high as those used to evaluate work in traditional courses. Internships will be graded pass/fail. (Internships do not count toward the three course pass/fail limit.) Practica must have assigned letter grades, A through F.<br><br>An internship manual with guidelines and sample learning contracts is available through the Office of the Dean of Academic Life and the Career Center (www. muhlenberg.edu/careercenter/ jobs.html).</p>

        <p>Interdisciplinary studies combine courses from more than one discipline, permitting students to explore an area of interest from several perspectives. In some cases, two fields are combined to form one major. In others, several disciplines are represented in the major or minor requirements. Where a major or minor is not available, students may concentrate on a topic of interest as they complete the general academic requirements and choose their electives. In this way, they may elect clusters of courses of special interest to them.</p>

        <p>The Maastricht Education Abroad Program is specifically designed for Business Administration majors who wish to gain an international business perspective. The program was developed in cooperation with the University of Maastricht in the Netherlands and offers four courses in business and economics that can be used to satisfy the concentration requirement. Courses are offered by University of Maastricht faculty to participating Muhlenberg students during the fall semester of their junior year. Besides deepening global and cultural awareness, students have opportunities to travel to France, Belgium, and Germany all of which are less than thirty minutes away, and meet business and political leaders from those countries. Courses are transferred back to Muhlenberg. Grades do not factor into the student's Muhlenberg GPA unless a Muhlenberg faculty also offers a course in Maastricht. That course grade will factor into the student's Muhlenberg GPA.</p>

        <p>Students generally select a field of study no later than the fall semester of the sophomore year, although major declarations may be made earlier or later in consultation with the academic advisor. In order to enter and remain in a department/program as a major, a student must maintain at least a 2.00 cumulative GPA in courses prescribed by the department/ program. See individual departments/programs for any variances to this requirement. At the end of any semester, a department/program may drop a student who fails to meet the minimum GPA standard or place that student on a probationary status in the major. The student will remain with the same advisor in the major department/program, regardless of status, in hope that s/he will be removed from probation and be able to declare the major once again.<br /><br />Students must be accepted into a major prior to the senior year and must complete a major program in order to graduate. A student may change from one major to another with the approval of the appropriate department chairs/program directors. Official major/ minor declarations must be completed through the Office of the Registrar.<br /><br />Minor programs are also available. Course work required for a minor is approximately three-fifths of that required for a major and is at least 5 course units. All rules that currently apply to majors also apply to minors. Any course accepted by the College can be counted simultaneously towards the requirements of both major and minor programs.</p>
<p><strong>Major and Minor Program Options</strong><br /><br />Students at the College are allowed to graduate with a single major, a single major with one or two minors, or a double major. If a student meets the requirements for majors or minors in excess of the previously stated limits, the student must choose which majors or minors he or she wants the College to recognize at graduation. Any course accepted by the College can be counted simultaneously towards the requirements of both major and minor programs.</p>

One of the three pass/fail courses may be taken in the same academic division as the student's major or minor. &nbsp;Courses designated "pass/fail only" are exempt from the pass/fail requirements described here. No course for which a student elects to enroll on a pass/fail basis may be used to satisfy a general academic requirement or major/minor requirement. In addition, "pass/fail only" courses offered within the student's major or minor do not meet any degree requirement.</p>
<p align="justify">Final grades submitted to the Registrar for these students must be either "P" or "F". &nbsp;A "P" should be considered the equivalent of a traditional "D" or higher.</p>
<p align="justify">Courses enrolled on a pass/fail basis that are awarded a grade of "P" will not be used in computing the GPA but will be counted as course units toward graduation; courses failed will be computed in the GPA.

<p align="justify">Students may petition the Curriculum Committee Subcommittee on Student Petitions for exceptions to academic policy at any time during the regular academic year. Petition forms are available from the Office of the Dean of Academic Life, and students should meet with the Dean to discuss the process and content of the petition. <span class="underline">Decisions of the Subcommittee are final</span>. Petition forms must be completed in full with appropriate faculty signatures. The petition form should be accompanied by a written explanation setting forth the circumstances of the student's case under petition. Letters of support or clarification from involved faculty or counselors are also encouraged. The Subcommittee meets during the academic year and the student will be notified in writing of the decision.</p>
<p align="justify">A student may petition the Subcommittee for exception to most academic policies. However, no petition will be entertained which pertains to the 2.00 cumulative average in the major program, the 2.00 cumulative average for graduation, or the 34 course units required for graduation.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Petitions to Writing Program Committee</strong></p>
<p align="justify">In exceptional cases, students may appeal to the Writing Program Committee to receive special W-credit for a course that is not designated as a W. The fact that a student has done a significant amount of writing in a course is not, of itself, sufficient reason for assigning special W-credit, since a writing-intensive course is a particular kind of collaborative learning experience.</p>

        <p>The Preferred Name policy at Muhlenberg College allows students to change their first name in many college information systems without pursuing a legal name change. By allowing students to use a preferred name, the college hopes to give students an empowering, safe, and nondiscriminatory college experience. Reasons for name changes may include transgender or gender nonconforming identities, international students or other students who wish to adopt an English language name, or students known by names that are different from their legal names. <br /><br />Only the student&rsquo;s first name will be updated with a preferred name. The student&rsquo;s Legal Name will remain in the college information systems and will be used where required by college business or legal need. &nbsp;<br /><br />Students should give serious consideration to the request to use a preferred name, as this option may be used only once during a student&rsquo;s time at Muhlenberg unless a compelling circumstance arises.<br /><br />Muhlenberg College will display preferred names to the campus community where feasible and appropriate, and it will make a good faith effort to update the reports, documents, and systems designated to use preferred names. <br /><br /><strong>Restrictions to Preferred Name</strong><br /><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Misrepresentation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fraud</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Attempt to avoid a legal obligation</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p align="justify"><br />NOTE: Students have the right to choose a name, but Muhlenberg College reserves the right to deny any preferred name request that is deemed inappropriate (no jargon or slang names or names that include adjectives). If a preferred name is denied, the student may appeal to the Provost or the Dean of Students. <br /><br /><strong>What students need to do</strong><br /><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>Complete the Preferred Name form
<ul>
<li>found in the Registrar&rsquo;s Office</li>
<li>found on the Registrar&rsquo;s Office web site</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Bring completed form to the Registrar&rsquo;s Office</li>
<li>Get a new BergID card (the cost of the replacement card will be $25)
<ul>
<li>Go to Seeger&rsquo;s Union with the approved Preferred Name form</li>
<li>If desired, a new photo can be taken</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p align="justify"><br />NOTE: The BergID card is not a legal form of identification. A student should carry a driver&rsquo;s license or other legal identification when leaving campus or needing to provide legal identification.<br /><br /><strong>What will happen?</strong><br /><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>After receiving the Preferred Name form, the Registrar will add the student&rsquo;s preferred first name to Capstone.&nbsp; If the request is denied, the Registrar will contact the student.</li>
<li>The preferred name will then appear in the following areas:
<ul>
<li>Class lists&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
<li>Canvas &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
<li>Campus directory</li>
<li>Advising lists</li>
<li>Housing rosters</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>OIT will update the student&rsquo;s email address to show the preferred name</li>
<li>If the student has the photo on the BergID retaken, this photo will replace the original on the faculty class lists.</li>
<li>External communications: College communications sent to hometown newspapers, letters to home, and other forms of external communications may vary based on the protocol of a department, advisor, or dean. It is recommended that students connect with anyone writing letters of recommendation about the name to be used.</li>

        <p align="justify">Traditional day students seeking readmission to the College must submit an application to the Dean of Academic Life for review by the Readmission and Status Change Committee. &nbsp;Student applications are considered on a case-by-case basis and must present compelling evidence of success, both in terms of academic and social conduct. &nbsp;Such conduct at the College and interactions with the College after leaving officially will be taken into consideration.&nbsp; Applications are due November 15 for request to return in the spring semester and May 15 for return in the fall semester.&nbsp; Readmission is not guaranteed.</p>
<p align="justify">Students who left the College in order to perform military service will be readmitted with the same academic status they had when last in attendance at Muhlenberg. In most cases, the length of the absence from the College cannot exceed five years.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="justify">Students who have left voluntarily and in Good Standing academically should send a personal letter requesting readmission and explaining the reasons for leaving the College, activities since withdrawal or dismissal, reasons for wishing to return, and compelling evidence of readiness to be a successful student in this residential liberal arts environment. Supplementary materials such as transcripts or letters of recommendation from employers can be included.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="justify">Students who have been dismissed for academic deficiency may apply no sooner than two semesters after dismissal. In addition to the information about activities and conduct noted above, students should present evidence of good academic performance, such as a B level in at least three courses per semester or quarter at an accredited four-year institution. Course syllabi and faculty letters addressing attendance, timeliness of assignments, and other relevant factors are helpful. If the application is approved, the student will be on academic probation for one semester. Significant progress, both numerically and qualitatively, must be made toward removal from probation at the end of that semester or students will be dismissed. A second dismissal is absolute, and no application for readmission will be entertained.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="justify">Students readmitted will be provided housing following the on-campus room selection on a space available basis. Once readmitted, students will need to apply for financial aid through the Office of Financial Aid. Financial aid is not guaranteed.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="justify">Further information is available through the Dean of Academic Life.&nbsp;</p>

        <p align="justify">The College has adopted the following regulations with respect to refunds and rebates due to the withdrawal, suspension, or expulsion of a student during the semester. The College is entitled to a portion of the comprehensive fee in accordance with the following schedule: &nbsp;</p>
<p>20 percent if withdrawal occurs during first week;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />40 percent if withdrawal occurs during second week;&nbsp;<br />60 percent if withdrawal occurs during third week; &nbsp;&nbsp; <br />80 percent if withdrawal occurs during fourth week; <br />100 percent if withdrawal occurs after the fourth week.</p>
<p align="justify">Note: Student aid which must be returned to the awarding agency cannot be used to satisfy amounts owed to the College.</p>
<p align="justify">Withdrawal due to medical reasons approved by the Director of Student Health Services or Director of Counseling may entitle a student to a pro rata refund of the comprehensive fee. The amount to be refunded, if any, will be decided based upon merit. The following fees and deposits are not refundable: application fee, matriculation fee, orientation fee, reservation deposit for admission, room reservation deposit, and room fees.</p>
<p align="justify">Board Fee: In all cases of withdrawal, a refund of the contract portion of the board fee will be made in proportion to the number of unexpired full weeks remaining, provided the refund is applied for at the time of withdrawal from the College and the student meal plan is surrendered.</p>
<p align="justify">Flex Dollars: Unused flex dollars will be refunded to a withdrawn student.</p>
<p align="justify">Room Fee: A student withdrawing from the College during the semester will receive a refund of room fees only if a replacement, not already residing in the College residential system, is obtained for the room.</p>
<p align="justify">The Financial Aid Office is required by federal statute to recalculate federal financial aid eligibility for students who withdraw, drop out, are dismissed, or take a leave of absence prior to completing 60% of a payment period or term. The federal Title IV financial aid programs must be recalculated in these situations.</p>
<p align="justify">If a student leaves the institution prior to completing 60% of a payment period or term, the financial aid office recalculates eligibility for Title IV funds. Recalculation is based on the percentage of earned aid using the following Federal Return of the Title IV funds formula:</p>
<p align="justify">Percentage of payment period or term completed equals the number of days completed up to the withdrawal date divided by the total days in the payment period or term. (Any break of five days or more is not counted as part of the days in the term.) This percentage is also the percentage of earned aid.</p>
<p align="justify">Funds are returned to the appropriate federal program based on the percentage of unearned aid using the following formula:</p>
<p align="justify">Aid to be returned equals (100% of the aid that could not be disbursed minus the percentage of earned aid) multiplied by the total amount of aid that could have been disbursed during the payment period or term.</p>
<p align="justify">If a student earned less aid than was disbursed, the institution would be required to return a portion of the funds and the student would be required to return a portion of the funds. Keep in mind that when Title IV funds are returned, the student borrower may owe a debit balance to the institution.</p>
<p align="justify">Refunds are allocated in the following order:</p>
<p>&bull;&nbsp;Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loans &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&bull; Subsidized Federal Stafford Loans &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

        <p align="justify">Course credit cannot be earned unless a student is officially registered with the College for the course. Registration for courses and sections is done by the student via CapStone Online (except for independent courses, FYS sections, and clusters). Faculty may give permission via the online system, but the student must then register for the course. &nbsp;<span class="underline">Informal arrangements, including section changes, between a student and an instructor do not constitute official registration.</span> Registration is not available to students until they have made arrangements for financial charges with the Controller's Office.</p>
<p align="justify">College-wide registrations are held twice each year: November for spring semester and April for fall semester. Specific registration dates are posted in the academic calendar and on the web.</p>
<p><strong>Registration by Alphabetical Grouping</strong></p>
<p align="justify">Students are registered by class and in assigned groups. Each class is divided into groups, with group assignments being determined by the beginning letters of the student's last name. Students may begin registering at their assigned time and continue through the conclusion of the add/drop period. Each semester the student's group will move down one or two time slots for the Class of 2017 and 2018 and up one or two time slots for the Class of 2019 and 2020. &nbsp;For example, if the student registers in group #7 the first time, the next registration s/he will go down a time slot and register in group #8, then #1, etc., OR the student may register in group #7 the first time, the next registration s/he will go up a time slot and register in group #6, then #5, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Registration of Study Abroad and Washington Semester Students</strong></p>
<p align="justify">Students who are abroad and in Washington will register using Online Registration. They will be able to begin at 8:00 a.m. ET the day their class begins registration.</p>
<p><strong>Location for Registration</strong></p>
<p align="justify">Wherever you have access to the internet - your dorm room, a computer lab, a Blackberry, etc. The Office of the Registrar on the ground floor of Haas, is available for assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Registration Planning Worksheet: </strong></p>
<p align="justify">Complete the top portion with courses/requirements completed and/or currently being taken. In the bottom section, list your course choices. Make sure you provide some alternates in case your first choices fill. Bring the form to your meeting with your academic advisor(s). S/he will review and provide information and guidance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Approval</strong></p>
<p align="justify">Only your official advisor will be able to grant you permission to register. S/he will do so online. If you have two majors, both major advisors must give you approval. Minors advisors do not give online approval. Make sure to make an appointment with your advisor prior to your registration day. If you are in the Education Certification program, you must have approval from your Education Department advisor. Also, any Education course over 101 MUST have the online approval of the Education Department. Faculty who agree to provide course permissions (i.e. entry into a full course; override of a missing prerequisite, etc.), will enter the permission online, and then you must register for the course.</p>
<p><strong>Changes in Registration - All Classes</strong></p>
<p align="justify">Students may make changes to their schedule online at any time after the initial registration up until the end of the add/drop period.</p>
<p><strong>Wescoe Course Registration</strong></p>
<p align="justify">Day students may register in courses offered through the Wescoe School 15-week session during the add/drop period on a space-available basis with permission from the appropriate department chair and the Dean of the Wescoe School. No more than one such course may be registered in any one semester and should be done only after consultation with the student's academic advisor. First-year students must obtain signed permission from the Dean of Academic Life prior to consideration of the request by the Dean of the Wescoe School.</p>

<p align="justify">Muhlenberg College recognizes the importance of religious expression in the lives of many of our students. Indeed, the quality and strength of religious life is one of the distinctive characteristics of the College, attracting many students to Muhlenberg.</p>
</div>
<p align="justify">Muhlenberg College has a long standing policy that students may make arrangements to make up course work missed due to a holiday when their religion prohibits them from work. This policy means that a student will not have the absence counted against the course grade and will be allowed to complete required assignments after returning from the absence.</p>
<p align="justify">There are many religious observances (for example Ramadan in Islam and Hanukkah in Judaism) that do not require that a student miss class - since work is not prohibited. However, many of these holidays impact a student's life in important ways.</p>
<p><strong>Responsibilities of the instructor include:</strong></p>
<p align="justify"><span class="content-add05">Instructors will make sure that work missed for a religious holiday can be made up by the student.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span class="content-add05">Instructors will articulate clear guidelines for how a student may make up missed work.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span class="content-add05">Instructors will make students aware of the way in which an attendance policy allows for making up work missed for a religious holiday.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span class="content-add05">Instructors may give an exam on a religious holiday provided that there is an appropriate way for a student to make up the exam if it is missed due to the observance of a religious holiday. </span></p>
<p><strong>Responsibilities of the student include:</strong></p>
<p align="justify"><span class="content-add05">Students are required to identify to the instructor, <strong>in advance</strong>, that their absence will be for excused religious reasons.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span class="content-add05">Students must make these arrangements with their instructors in a timely fashion and in a way that allows for the instructor to plan how missed work will be made up.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span class="content-add05">Students are required to make up any work that is missed.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span class="content-add05">Students must take responsibility for honestly representing their religious commitments when missing a class.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span class="content-add05">Students must be aware of the attendance policies in their courses and should make sure that if a limited number of absences are allowed they do not needlessly use up absences that they may need for religious observances. </span></p>
<p align="justify">Campus chaplaincy staff is available at any time to help our community understand the role of religious holidays in the lives of students, faculty, and staff. They should be called with any questions; if they cannot answer a question, they will be able to refer to a reliable source of information.</p>
<p align="justify">Listed below are religious holidays that some of our community may be observing over the course of the year. <span class="underline">Only those marked with an asterisk are days on which work would be prohibited and hence would require that an observant student miss class.</span>&nbsp; Dates for the current year may be found at <a href="http://muhlenberg.edu/main/campuslife/religiouslife/holydays/">http://muhlenberg.edu/main/campuslife/religiouslife/holydays/</a>.</p>

        <p align="justify">The RJ Fellows Program was established to strengthen and develop the decision-making competencies of bright, talented, and hard-working liberal arts undergraduates. The Program's founders assert that education can be a powerful force in strengthening each individual's ability to assess the future and make wise choices, and that liberal arts education, in particular, has the potential to provide individuals with a variety of analytical, problem-solving, ethical-assessment, and decision-making skills. The Program is deliberately interdisciplinary. Courses affiliated with the program have three areas of study centering around: (1) the definition of models of change; (2) the examination, analysis and interpretation of principal moments of change within history; and (3) the development of analysis and strategies to face contemporary and future changes. The program carries a $4,000 annual stipend.</p>
<p align="justify"><span class="italic">While the course offerings vary semester by semester, all RJ Fellows must complete 4 courses with the RJ designation. In selecting RJ courses, <strong>no fewer than 3 of the academic divisions must be represented</strong>:</span></p>

        <p>Highly motivated students may propose a self-designed major not falling within one of the departments, divisions, or area study programs listed in the College catalog. The proposal must include a coherent rationale for the structure and course content of the major and an endorsement of a faculty member willing to serve as an advisor. This proposal should be submitted in writing to the Curriculum Committee liaison after consultation with the departments involved. The proposal must be approved by Curriculum Committee and the Provost, typically prior to the beginning of the junior year and never later than the end of the fifth semester. Students &nbsp;seeking this option should work well in advance of the approval deadline. A student wishing to pursue this option should contact the Dean of Academic Life to receive the name of the Curriculum Committee liaison or chair of the committee.</p>

<p align="justify">Offices of the College are authorized to collect and record SSN data in a secure manner when required by federal or state governmental agencies or when required by contractual arrangement with third parties.

Also, any student applying for Financial Aid must provide a SSN to the College. &nbsp;Refusal to provide a SSN may result in specific services being unavailable, including transcripts, enrollment verification, tax reporting, student employment, and financial aid.</p>

<p><strong>I.&nbsp; </strong><strong>SCOPE</strong></p>
<p>This policy applies to all credit-bearing distance learning courses and programs offered by Muhlenberg College, beginning with the application for admission and continuing through to a student’s graduation, transfer, or withdrawal from study.</p>
<p><strong>II. </strong><strong>POLICY STATEMENT</strong></p>
<p>All credit-bearing courses and programs offered through distance learning methods must verify that the student who registers for a distance education course or program is the same student who participates in and completes the course or program and receives academic credit. One or more of the following methods must be used:</p>
<ul>
<li>A secure login and password. Each Muhlenberg student is assigned a unique student id and password to login to a number of Muhlenberg’s systems. These include the learning management system (Canvas) and student information system (Capstone). The student is instructed to keep this ID/Password personal and confidential per the Muhlenberg College Policy on Electronic Communication and Internet Access.</li>
<li>Proctored examinations; use of essays, in-person exams, and other activities that require face-to-face interaction by faculty that minimize the possibility of academic dishonesty; and/or</li>
<li>New or emerging technologies and practices that are effective in verifying student identification.</li>
</ul>
<p>All methods of verifying student identity in distance learning must protect the privacy of student information.</p>
<p>Personally identifiable information collected by the College may be used, at the discretion of the institution, as the basis for identity verification. For instance, a student requesting that their Canvas (LMS) be reset may be asked to provide two or more pieces of information for comparison with data on file, or to come to the OIT Help Desk in person with a BergID card or other verification. In the same way, a student requesting that their Capstone (SIS) password be reset may be asked to provide two or more pieces of information for comparison with data on file, or to come to the Office of the Registrar in person with a BergID card or other verification.</p>
<p><strong>III. </strong><strong>RESPONSIBILITIES</strong></p>
<p>All users of the College’s learning management systems are responsible for maintaining the security of usernames, passwords, and any other access credentials assigned as per the Policy on Electronic Communication and Internet Access and the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act. Access credentials may not be shared or given to anyone other than the user to whom they were assigned to for any reason. Users are responsible for any and all uses of their account. Users are held responsible for knowledge of the information contained within the most recent College Catalog as well as the Student Policy and Resource Guide. Failure to read College guidelines, requirements, and regulations will not exempt users from responsibility.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students are responsible for providing complete and true information about themselves in any identity verification process.</p>
<p>Faculty teaching courses through distance education methods hold primary responsibility for ensuring that their individual courses comply with the provisions of this policy. Faculty are responsible for informing the Associate Dean of Digital Learning of any new technologies being used to verify student identity, so that published information on student privacy can be maintained appropriately, and so that the College can coordinate resources and services efficiently. Because technology and personal accountability may not verify identity absolutely or ensure academic integrity completely, faculty are encouraged, when feasible and pedagogically sound, to design courses that employ assignments and evaluations unique to the course and that support academic integrity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Department Chairs, Program Directors, and the Associate Dean of Digital Learning are responsible for ensuring that faculty are aware of this policy and comply with its provisions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Provost is responsible for ensuring College-wide compliance with the provisions of this policy and that Deans, Directors, and the Associate Dean are informed of any changes in a timely fashion. The Provost is responsible for publishing College-wide information on how identity verification processes protect student privacy, and is also responsible for coordinating and promoting efficient use of College resources and services, and for ensuring that College level processes also remain in compliance with this policy.</p>

<p align="justify">Students may submit a written request to the Registrar to withhold the release of directory information. The Registrar will notify college offices if such a request is made. No information can be released about students who make this type of request without their written consent. The request will be honored until removed; written notice must be received to discontinue the non-disclosure request, regardless of whether or not the person is still enrolled at the College.</p>
<p><strong><span class="italic">What about parents? </span></strong></p>
<p align="justify">Student information release rights are held by the student and no one else. Muhlenberg College can and chooses, but is in no way obligated, to share selected information about a student, beyond what is considered directory information, with his/her parents. In order to comply with FERPA regulations, however, one of the following statements must be true:</p>
<p align="justify"><span class="content-add05">we have written permission from the student, or</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span class="content-add05">parents can provide proof that the student is financially dependent on them.</span></p>
<p align="justify">As we inform students of their information release rights, we ask them to decide whether they wish to give the college permission to share information we deem appropriate, such as course grades and financial information, with their parents. Typically, this question is decided by students during June Advising. Any information shared with one parent is disclosed to both unless the student specifically denies access to one parent. Questions or concerns about disclosure of information should be brought to the Registrar.</p>
<p><strong><span class="italic">Sharing information over the telephone? </span></strong></p>
<p align="justify">If at all possible, no information concerning the educational record of a student should be discussed over the telephone. If a personal meeting is impossible, steps must be taken to positively identify the caller before releasing personally identifiable information of any type. Whenever possible, confirm information rather than provide for its initial release.</p>

        <p align="justify">In a world that is becoming increasingly interdependent, study abroad represents a significant means by which students may better prepare themselves to face challenges of the future. Muhlenberg College encourages students in all majors to study overseas at quality institutions in Europe, Oceania, Asia, Latin America, and Africa. Our list of over 150 approved programs in 60 countries enables students to engage in the academic and social life of host institutions abroad. In addition, some programs provide opportunities for experiential learning through internships and field work research projects that integrate student involvement in local communities.</p>
<p align="justify">Muhlenberg supports two faculty-led, discipline-specific, study abroad opportunities: the program for Accounting, Business, Economics, and Finance majors at the University of Maastricht in the Netherlands during the fall semester; and the Media and Communication and Film Studies program at Dublin City University in Ireland during the spring semester.</p>
<p align="justify">Students study abroad after completing their sophomore year, for either a semester or for the academic year during their junior year. Upon receiving approval from the Dean of Academic Life, due to extraordinary circumstances, students may study abroad during the fall semester of their senior year. &nbsp;Students who study abroad during the academic year receive the same financial aid package that would be provided were they to remain on the Muhlenberg campus.</p>
<p align="justify">Opportunities for summer study are available through several Muhlenberg departments. Other summer programs must be approved by the Office of Global Education before students can apply to them.</p>
<p align="justify">Students interested in study abroad programs should consult with their faculty advisor and the Office of Global Education staff during the fall semester of their sophomore year. To apply for study abroad, students must first complete a Muhlenberg College Study Abroad application. &nbsp;Once approved to study abroad by Muhlenberg, students complete host institution application materials.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p align="justify"><span class="italic">Program Policies and Procedures:</span></p>
<p align="justify">1. Any student in good standing may apply for admission to an education abroad program.</p>
<p align="justify">2. All education abroad applications must be made through the Office of Global Education which is also able to provide detailed application procedures.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Students must be enrolled as full-time Muhlenberg students when participating in any affiliated or other College approved education abroad program offered during the regular academic year.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Students enrolling in any summer education abroad program for which credit transfer is desired must receive prior approval of the program from the Dean of Global Education.</p>
<p align="justify">5. Credits earned abroad in any non-approved education abroad program will not be accepted for transfer.</p>
<p align="justify">6. Application forms must be completed and returned to the Office of Global Education by the deadline date(s) specified.</p>
<p align="justify">7. Students are competitively selected based on academic performance, conformity with College standards of social behavior, and other relevant considerations. Where the program preference of the student is considered inappropriate (e.g., because of GPA requirements or academic major/minor), alternative programs will be suggested to the student by the Global Education Coordinator.</p>
<p align="justify">8. Late applications are considered on a space availability basis.</p>
<p align="justify">9. Once a commitment, as evidenced by payment of the required acceptance deposit, to participate in an education abroad program has been made, a student will not be allowed to enroll in any Muhlenberg courses or apply for Muhlenberg housing during the period for which he or she will be enrolled in the education aboard program.</p>
<p align="justify">10. For most programs students accepted by the Office of Global Education must apply for admission to the host institution. &nbsp;In such cases, the decision to admit the student is the prerogative of the host institution. Some programs do have GPA requirements of 3.3 or higher.</p>
<p align="justify">11. Program participation balance consistent with the financial requirements of the College will be maintained. At this time, approximately 60 percent of education abroad enrollments will take place during the fall semester.</p>
<p align="justify">12. Any questions should be addressed to the Office of Global Education.</p>

        <p>Muhlenberg College offers a variety of day and evening courses during a series of summer sessions. These courses, while typically offered in an accelerated format, incorporate pedagogy appropriate for full-time undergraduate students. All course units and grades earned through summer study at Muhlenberg are attributed to the total program of the student and influence the cumulative grade point average and academic standing of the student accordingly. &nbsp;Summer load is 2 courses at a time for a maximum combined summer load of 4 course units. Summer study materials are available through the Wescoe School in early March.</p>

<li>
<p><strong>First-day Drop Policy:&nbsp; </strong>Please note that students not attending the first day of classes will be dropped from the course <strong>only if the faculty indicate to the Registrar that specific students are to be removed from the roster. </strong>After that time, students must complete the drop online process to drop the class.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Religious Holidays:&nbsp; </strong>The Chaplain issues a document of the significant holy days for the upcoming academic year. The holy days calendar may be found online at <a href="http://muhlenberg.edu/main/campuslife/religiouslife/holydays/">http://www.muhlenberg.edu/main/campuslife/holydays/</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mid-term Grades:&nbsp; All first-year students and students on academic probation or the warning list are to receive mid-term grades. </strong>These grades are vital in helping the College monitor and assist some of our most vulnerable students.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Academic Struggle Notification:</strong>&nbsp; If an upperclassman is struggling academically but is currently not on Academic Probation or Warning, neither the advisor nor the Dean will have any official indication until final grades. Faculty might wish to include a statement in syllabi explaining to students that the Dean may be informed of poor performance at the mid-term point.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Thanksgiving Break:</strong>&nbsp; Thanksgiving Break begins at the conclusion of evening classes on the Tuesday prior to Thanksgiving. The College expects classes to be held as scheduled on Monday and Tuesday before Thanksgiving.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Final Exams:</strong>&nbsp; According to the faculty handbook, <strong>faculty should not schedule final exams during the last week of classes.&nbsp; </strong>Moreover, faculty and students should understand that they are expected to be <strong>available on campus </strong>until the last day of finals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Incompletes:&nbsp; </strong>As affirmed by the Academic Policy Committee, Incompletes should be awarded <em>only</em> for compelling reasons and <em>after</em> conversation with the student. The student and faculty member should have a clear agreement <em>in writing</em> on the work to be submitted and the consequences should work not be completed on time. You should consult with the appropriate campus health professional if medical reasons are involved. For more information, consult the Incomplete Grades Policy on this web site.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Incompletes and performance/participation courses:</strong>&nbsp; There are performance/participation based courses (i.e. acting, dance, student teaching, etc.) for which an Incomplete is not feasible. Please consult the Incomplete Grades Policy on this web site for more information. Suggested language for syllabi for such courses includes:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Since the majority of graded work in this course is based on participation and performance that cannot be completed once the course is over, grades of Incomplete will not be granted.</p>
<p><strong>OR</strong></p>
<p>Performance or participation based components of this course are not subject to Incomplete grades.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Deadline to Withdraw from a Class:&nbsp; </strong>If efforts for good academic progress have not proven successful for a student, or if the student has not attended class, that student should probably withdraw from the course. The deadline for withdrawal is noted each semester on the academic calendar. By College policy, only medical withdrawals (arranged through the Director of Counseling or the Director of Health Services) are permitted after the withdrawal deadline. Please note that students are expected to maintain <strong>at least a three-course load</strong> during the semester.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Academic Integrity Code:</strong>&nbsp; Please review the Code, which is found online at <a href="http://www.muhlenberg.edu/main/aboutus/dean-academic/integrity">www.muhlenberg.edu/main/aboutus/dean-academic/integrity</a> and in the Student Policy and Information guide. Make sure that students in your class understand the principles of academic integrity, the particulars of the Academic Integrity Code, and the potential consequences of violating the Code. Most professors include a section on the Academic Integrity Code on their syllabi and may have supplementary materials specific to their classes.&nbsp; Please be clear. Students need to know your expectations.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Course Goals on Syllabus:</strong> &nbsp;The Middle State Commission on Higher Education requires that accredited institutions show evidence of expectations of student learning at all levels (course, program, and institution). Course syllabi should state the primary outcomes for the course &ndash; the knowledge, skills, and attitudes that students will gain after completing the course. Course goals should align with department learning outcomes and with Muhlenberg College&rsquo;s Academic Program Goals.&nbsp; All departments should have their major learning goals posted on the department website.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Course Unit Instruction:</strong>&nbsp; In order to comply with the July 1, 2011 Credit Hours provision of the Higher Education Opportunity Act, all course syllabi should have a section that identifies the scheduled meeting times for the course. If the course is scheduled to meet for less than 4 hours a week (which could include lecture and lab hours), the additional &ldquo;4<sup>th</sup> hour instructional activities&rdquo; should be described. A course as a unit of instruction may include a combination of lecture, discussion, recitation, computer work, group projects, and laboratory work. Below are representative statements that can be adapted for your syllabi:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This class is scheduled to meet for 3 hours per week. Additional instructional activities for the course include weekly workshops organized by the Learning Assistants.</p>
<p>This course is schedule to meet for 3 hours per week. Additional instructional activities for the course include attendance at specified College lectures and events and required writing workshops distributed across the semester. These activities will add an additional 14 hours of instruction.</p>
<p>This class is scheduled to meet for 3 hours per week. Additional instructional activities for the course include 20 hours of service learning work distributed across the semester.</p>
<p>This class is scheduled to meet for 4 hours per week of classroom instruction.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Students with Disabilities or Special Needs:&nbsp; </strong>Students with documented disabilities having an impact on academic performance may request classroom or course accommodations, auxiliary aides, and services provided they do not compromise the essential elements of your course. Requests for accommodations must be made in a timely fashion, at the beginning of each semester. An Accommodation Plan is developed only <em>after</em> the student meets with appropriate, disability-related professional(s). A single Accommodation Plan indicating accommodations, auxiliary aides, and services will come from the Director of Disability Services, and will include a list of collaborating professionals who may provide additional resources and consultation about the student.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Syllabi Statement:&nbsp; </strong>It is <em>vital</em> to include statements regarding this student population on syllabi. The following statement, whose language has met the legal test, would be appropriate.</p>
<p>Students with disabilities requesting classroom or course accommodations must complete a multi-faceted determination process through the Office of Disability Services prior to the development and implementation of accommodations, auxiliary aids, and services. Each Accommodation Plan is individually and collaboratively developed between the student and the Office of Disability Services. If you have not already done so, please contact the Office of Disability Services to have a dialogue regarding your academic needs and the recommended accommodations, auxiliary aides, and services.</p>
<p><strong>Testing Accommodations:&nbsp; </strong>Students with disabilities who qualify for testing accommodations should have a dialogue with faculty about the specifics and logistics of the testing accommodations. While tests are administered and proctored at the department level, in department space, it may be appropriate for students with disabilities that impact testing to take their tests with accommodations in the Testing Suite (located in the Office of Disability Services in Seegers Union). Limited space availability requires that testing appointments be made well in advance of the testing date. Students are responsible for setting up the appointments, completing the student section of the <strong>Proctored and Accommodated Testing Form</strong>, and bringing the form to the faculty member. The faculty member is responsible for completing the faculty section of the form and for dropping off/picking up the exam.&nbsp; Please contact the ODS (x3825) for more information.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Concerns about students:&nbsp; </strong>While not technically a syllabus item per se, early interventions have often assisted students with worrisome patterns. Faculty are encouraged to encouraged to notify the Dean of Academic Life and the student&rsquo;s advisor in addition to your own efforts to communicate with the student. The goal of this protocol is to help students get back on track before situations are unsalvageable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Student Help Desk:</strong>&nbsp; You may want to inform students of the Student Help Desk, part of the Office of Information Technology (OIT), which provides free technical support for all students who may be experiencing issues with their computers or other devices such as mobile phones. The Student Help Desk is located in Ettinger 003 and is open Monday through Friday from 8:00 a.m. to 5 p.m. and on the weekends as student worker&rsquo;s schedules permit. Email <a href="mailto:helpdesk@muhlenberg.edu">helpdesk@muhlenberg.edu</a> or call 484-664-3375.</p>

        <p align="justify">A complete and unabridged transcript of the academic record is prepared for each student who enrolls at Muhlenberg College and is maintained on a permanent basis in the Office of the Registrar. In addition to courses and grades, the transcript reports academic status, grade point average, and other pertinent attendance information.</p>
<p><span class="italic">Transcripts of the academic record are available in two formats:</span></p>
<p align="justify"><strong>OFFICIAL</strong> transcripts are released only upon the written consent of the student directly to a third party, such as other higher education institutions and potential employers. If the official transcript is released to the student, it will be placed in a sealed envelope and stamped "Released to Student." If that seal is broken, the transcript is no longer considered official.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>UNOFFICIAL</strong> transcripts may be released directly to the student upon request.</p>
<p align="justify">In compliance with federal law, Muhlenberg's student information release policy permits the release of personally identifiable information from a student's education record only with the written consent of the student. <strong>The student is the only person with release rights to his/her records.</strong></p>
<p><span class="italic"><strong>Procedure for Requesting a Transcript</strong></span></p>
<p align="justify">Muhlenberg College complies with all federal regulations regarding the release of education records as established by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act.</p>
<p align="justify">All requests to release information from academic records must include a student's legal signature. This requirement specifically prohibits telephone and e-mail requests. Faxed requests are acceptable. &nbsp;Students may also request their transcript online. The link may be found on the CapStone Online menu and through the Registrar's web site menu under "Transcripts".</p>
<p align="justify">The student is the only person who can authorize the release of information from his/her academic record. No one else (parents, friends, spouses, employers) may do so for them.</p>
<p align="justify">Information released directly to the student is considered unofficial unless it is received in a sealed envelope. The student should clearly indicate the need for official documents on any request that instructs that copies be sent directly to him/her.</p>
<p align="justify">Transcripts are a complete record of the academic achievement at the College.</p>
<p><strong><span class="italic"> An information release request should include:</span></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Full name at time of attendance <br />Social security number <br />Date of first attendance <br />Current address <br />Address where the information should be sent <br />Specific handling instructions, if applicable</p>

<p align="justify">A small administrative fee is assessed for most record release services. &nbsp;Consult the chart below for details. Fees are payable at the time of request. Unpaid balances will result in a "stop" on the release of any further information from academic records.</p>

<p>Muhlenberg College recognizes that it is a fairly common occurrence for students to supplement their academic experience here by engaging in studies away from our campus. Listed below are the policies we follow with respect to transferring credit to Muhlenberg.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Almost all courses taken elsewhere must be <em>transferred</em> to Muhlenberg College.&nbsp; The only exception are courses offered through the Lehigh Valley Association of Independent Colleges (LVAIC) consortium.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order to be eligible for transfer, a course must typically be offered at a regionally accredited institution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After matriculating at Muhlenberg, students must receive pre-approval in order for a course to be considered for transfer toward the Muhlenberg degree.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order to be eligible for transfer, all courses must be consistent with the ideals of Muhlenberg’s liberal arts education.&nbsp; These ideals include attention to <em>how</em>students learn as well as what they learn.&nbsp; Such courses commonly include:</p>
<ul>
<li>critical thinking, analysis and synthesis,</li>
<li>interaction between the faculty member and the student,</li>
<li>interaction among students,</li>
<li>developing arguments through logic, evidence, and reason,</li>
<li>writing, and</li>
<li>faculty comments on writing assignments and/or exams.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Department chairs assess courses for transfer based on their hours, content, and pedagogy, using the description and syllabi to see if they are consistent with that taught at Muhlenberg or supportive of a liberal arts degree.&nbsp; Students must provide course syllabi and catalog descriptions when requesting transfer approval.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The College does not distinguish between online courses and other courses for general transfer credit counting towards the graduation requirement of 32 course units. &nbsp;For purposes of statistical reporting only, students will be asked to indicate on the Transfer Course Form whether the course is being taught online.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No online courses taken while studying abroad are eligible for course transfer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Courses of a vocational or technical nature are generally not acceptable for transfer.&nbsp; Remedial courses are not acceptable for transfer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At least 16 course units must be completed at Muhlenberg College.&nbsp; Consequently, no more than 16 non-Muhlenberg course units (whether transferred or awarded for test scores) may contribute to the 32 course units required to earn a bachelor’s degree at Muhlenberg.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The college will accept no more than five (5) transfer course units during a single academic term (fall or spring), while four (4) transfer course units is the limit for any combination of summer terms in a single summer.&nbsp; No courses taken concurrently elsewhere – including online courses – that exceed the course load limit of 5.5 units per semester will receive credit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only courses for which a grade of “C-” or better was earned will be considered for transfer to Muhlenberg.&nbsp; Courses not using a traditional letter grade (A-F) will be considered for transfer only if additional documentation detailing successful completion is provided.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Grades earned in transferred courses will not be included in the Muhlenberg grade point average nor will they be used to determine graduation honors.&nbsp; In order to be eligible for graduation honors, students must complete a minimum of 16 graded (not pass/fail) courses in residence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Accepting courses for transfer and applying them toward degree requirements are separate considerations.&nbsp; Courses may transfer as elective credits but not satisfy specific requirements.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The College normally awards transfer credit to courses taken within ten years of entering Muhlenberg.&nbsp; Courses that have been taken more than ten years prior will be evaluated on a course-by-course basis for transfer approval.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The College will evaluate military credits on a course-by-course basis for transfer approval.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;The College reserves the right to accept or deny the awarding of transfer credit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many institutions do not use a course unit system similar to Muhlenberg’s. &nbsp;Use the table below to convert between credit hours and course units:</p>

<p>If a student seeks to fulfill a major, minor, or general academic requirement through a transfer course, the appropriate department chairs and program directors will evaluate whether a particular course will fulfill that requirement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students seeking a Writing (“W”) designation for a transfer course must submit an application to the Writing Program Committee, including the syllabus and in some cases, a writing portfolio.&nbsp; The transfer course should resemble as closely as possible the structure of a “W” course at Muhlenberg.</p>

Courses offered through the Lehigh Valley Association of Independent Colleges (LVAIC) consortium and any course offered away from campus, but specifically identified in the College catalog, are the only exceptions.</p>
<p align="justify">Before Enrolling in a Course Elsewhere, a student should:</p>
<p align="justify"><span class="content-add05">Obtain course descriptions for any course(s) of interest at another institution.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span class="content-add05">Discuss plans for completing coursework elsewhere with an academic advisor and secure his or her signature before proceeding.</span></p>

<p align="justify"><span class="content-add05">Return the completed Transfer Course Authorization form to the Office of the Registrar.</span></p>
<p align="justify">After Completing the Course, a student should:</p>
<p align="justify"><span class="content-add05">Forward an official academic transcript to Muhlenberg. Direct academic transcripts to Muhlenberg College, Office of the Registrar, 2400 Chew Street, Allentown, PA 18104. <strong>No outside coursework will be posted to a Muhlenberg record until an official academic transcript is received from the institution attended.</strong></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span class="content-add05">If any type of financial aid was received through Muhlenberg, a financial aid transcript must be forwarded as well. Failing to do so may jeopardize eligibility for aid in future terms. Please direct financial aid transcripts to Muhlenberg College, Office of Financial Aid, 2400 Chew Street, Allentown, PA 18104.</span></p>
<p align="justify">Additional Information to be noted:</p>
<p align="justify"><span class="content-add05">No more than 16 non-Muhlenberg course units (whether transferred or awarded for test scores) may contribute to the 32 course units required to earn a bachelor's degree at Muhlenberg.

<p align="justify"><span class="content-add05">Once courses have been transferred, they become part of the permanent record at Muhlenberg and cannot be removed.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span class="content-add05">Many institutions use a credit system different from Muhlenberg's. For the purpose of all transfer transactions, the Muhlenberg course unit should be considered equivalent to 4 semester credit hours. In all cases, Muhlenberg College can accept transfer courses only with an official academic transcript from a regionally accredited higher education institution where courses have been successfully completed.</span></p>

The semester (fall or spring) is designed for juniors and seniors representing a variety of academic majors. In addition to seminars and field trips drawing upon the special resources available in Washington, there are hundreds of internship possibilities in government, social service agencies, religious groups, medicine, public interest organizations, business, and the arts. Participants also experience living and working in our capital with students from other Lutheran colleges throughout the United States. &nbsp;Courses are registered as if taken at Muhlenberg and grades are calculated in the GPA.

        <p align="justify">The mission of The Wescoe School of Muhlenberg College is to provide lifelong learners the opportunity to continue and enhance their education and to do so in ways that recognize their experience, maturity, motivation, life circumstances, and capacity for independent scholarship.</p>
<p align="justify">Lifelong learners are very different from traditionally aged full-time students. Recognizing this, the Wescoe School offers innovative programs of study with distinct and specialized opportunities. Its students can complete a degree by enrolling in classes at night, during the day (on a limited basis), and on weekends.</p>
<p class="underline">Accelerated Programs</p>
<p align="justify">The Wescoe School offers the Bachelor's degree in an accelerated format for the following majors: Business Administration; Business Administration with concentration areas in Healthcare Management, Human Resources Leadership, Financial Services, and Supply Chain Management; and Information Systems. &nbsp;Students learn collaboratively in a feedback-intensive program that prepares them for leadership in their chosen field and graduate level academic study. The curriculum is designed for immediate application to the workplace and develops presentation, facilitation, and problem-solving skills.</p>
<p align="justify">Students in this program complete 17 modules of study in a team-based experiential learning environment. They attend one four-hour class each week and meet outside of class for a weekly three- to four-hour session during which they work together on team projects and presentations. The program concludes with a culminating capstone project. This project is completed in cooperation with a local not-for- or for-profit organization whereby the students act as a consulting group to the organization. The students then present their findings to a panel of their instructors.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="underline">Liberal Arts Programs</p>
<p align="justify">Adult students have the option to enroll for credit classes in several formats: the traditional 15-week program, 8-week sessions, or weekend sessions. <span class="italic">The 8-week and weekend sessions are available only to Wescoe students and incorporate pedagogical practices appropriate to this population.</span> Under special circumstances, students with senior status may petition the Dean of Academic Life to be allowed to register one course unit in an 8-week or weekend session.</p>
<p align="justify">Day students may register in courses offered through the Wescoe School 15-week session during the add/drop period on a space-available basis with permission from the appropriate department chair and the Dean of the Wescoe School. No more than one such course may be registered in any one semester and should be done only after consultation with the student's academic advisor. First-year students must obtain signed permission from the Dean of Academic Life prior to consideration of the request by the Dean of the Wescoe School.</p>
<p align="justify">Additionally, the Wescoe School offers major certificates in every major of the College. Many Wescoe students take courses to prepare for future graduate study or to upgrade or learn new skills. In addition to the Bachelor's degree, Wescoe students may earn the Associate of Arts degree in some majors or enroll in a non-credit enrichment course.</p>
<p class="underline">Summer Study</p>
<p align="justify">Muhlenberg College offers a variety of day and evening courses during a series of summer sessions. These courses, while typically offered in an accelerated format, are unlike the courses in other 8-week and weekend sessions because they incorporate pedagogy appropriate for full-time undergraduate students. All course units and grades earned through summer study at Muhlenberg are attributed to the total program of the student and influence the cumulative grade point average and academic standing of the student accordingly. Summer load is 2 courses at a time for a maximum combined summer load of 4 course units. &nbsp;Summer study materials are available through the Wescoe School in early March.</p>

The student must process a withdrawal form, available from and returned to the Office of the Registrar, by the deadline. Both the instructor of the course and the student's advisor must sign the form. A "W" grade will be assigned indicating that the student has withdrawn from the course. The last day to withdraw is identified each semester on the College's academic calendar.</p>
<p align="justify">A full-time student seeking to withdraw from a course or courses so that s/he will earn fewer than 3 course units, must consult with his/her academic advisor concerning such a withdrawal. The advisor then consults with the Dean of Academic Life. If the Dean approves the withdrawal, s/he will forward the completed withdrawal form to the Office of the Registrar for processing.</p>
<p align="justify">No course may be withdrawn after the 45<sup>th</sup> class day except for documented medical reasons certified by the Executive Director of Health and Counseling Services.</p>
<p align="justify">A student who attends a different section of a course than the section registered must make the correction to his/her schedule by dropping the course online or processing a withdrawal form. Students who fail to correct registration errors or officially drop will receive a failing grade (F).</p>

        <p align="justify">Muhlenberg College offers cross-curricular writing programs in which faculty from every department participate. In specially designated writing-intensive courses, students attend to writing in context - within particular disciplines - but also with attention to ways in which effective writing shares similar traits across the disciplines. The aim of the program is to equip students to write analytically in a variety of writing situations.</p>
<p align="justify">The basic premise of the writing program is that writing is necessary to thinking and learning; it is an essential way of acquiring knowledge and of arriving at ideas about it. &nbsp;Another primary assumption of the program is that the ability to write well is not a skill one can acquire in a semester of grammar study. Instead, students are encouraged to take a number of writing-intensive courses throughout their careers at the College. The Writing Program is supported by a Writing Center that is staffed by trained peer tutors with majors in a wide range of disciplines.</p>
<p align="justify">A writing-intensive course is a regular academic course in which enrollment is limited to twenty students, and students will complete a minimum of fifteen pages of writing broken into at least three assignments. One of these assignments must be a revision in response to the instructor's written comments. As a requirement for graduation, students are required to take a minimum of three writing-intensive (W) courses - one First-Year Seminar, one W-course selected from anywhere in the curriculum, and one W-course designated by the student's major.</p>
<p align="justify">In exceptional cases, students may appeal to the Writing Program Committee to receive special W-credit for a course that is not designated as a W. The fact that a student has done a significant amount of writing in a course is not, of itself, sufficient reason for assigning special W-credit, since a writing-intensive course is a particular kind of collaborative learning experience.</p>
<p align="justify">For questions or additional information see Dr. Jill Stephen or Dr. David Rosenwasser, Department of English.</p>
