								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) is often identified and described by its hallmark symptoms: inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. However, those with ADHD don’t always exhibit all three of these symptoms. Because of this, the DSM 5 divides ADHD into four subcategories which are the predominately inattentive type (formerly known as ADD), predominately hyperactive-impulsive type, combined type and inattentive presentation (restrictive). The first two describe the primary symptom that is exhibited by an individual. For example, someone with ADHD of the predominately inattentive type would mostly have issues with paying and sustaining attention, while someone with predominately hyperactive-impulse type would display behaviors such as fidgeting, talking excessively, and interrupting others. Those with combined type have significant amounts of inattentive, hyperactive and impulsive symptoms. The rarest form of ADHD is inattention presentation (restrictive). This means that only symptoms of inattention are exhibited. People with this form of ADHD don’t have any issues with hyperactivity or impulsivity, but instead, exclusively have trouble with attention. This is rare because typically manifests itself as various combinations of symptoms from each of the three main categories. It is important to understand the various types of ADHD in order to better identify and understand it.</p>
<p>Similarly, ADHD often presents itself differently in girls. While boys typically deal with ADHD in more external ways such as blurting out answers and getting out of their seat at times when they should be seated, girls tend to react in more internal ways. This includes mood disorders, school anxiety, social skills deficits, and emotional over-reactivity. Girls are less diagnosed with ADHD than boys, not necessarily because it&#8217;s more common in boys but possibly because the diagnosis is often missed in girls. By understanding how ADHD is often presented in girls, we can better identify it.</p>
