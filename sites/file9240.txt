<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/11/chilihs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-530" title="Alexandra Chili" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/11/chilihs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Alexandra Chili</strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s it mean to you to be the leading scorer in Mule basketball history? </strong>Becoming the leading scorer in Mule basketball history has been a tremendous honor and certainly one of my favorite achievements of my college career. I’ve worked tirelessly throughout my four years to be the best player I could be, but my efforts would be wasted if I was not blessed with such amazing teammates.</p>
<p><strong>How did you become such a great shooter? </strong>I developed my shooting prowess like any other great shooter; hard work, persistence, repetition, dedication and some more hard work. When I was growing up, I would shoot 1,000 shots a day and wouldn’t rest until I had made 100 free throws. I’m not sure I can claim the same today, but that’s why you put in the work early!</p>
<p><strong>What’s it like having a father that played at Duke? </strong>Having a father like mine, regardless of whether he played at Duke, has been such a blessing. My Dad has always been there for me as a coach, rebounder, my biggest fan (tied with my mother, whom I love dearly) and anything I’ve needed to be successful. Being a star at Duke does have its perks though. We usually go to a game at Cameron Indoor Stadium once a year, and he seems to know everyone there! I’ve even met Coach K. That was beyond cool!</p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans? </strong>I’m hoping to play basketball professionally in Europe somewhere for a year since I was never able to study abroad. I really love to travel, and I think it will be a good experience for me to be out on my own for a little while. When I return to United States, I will seek admission to law school in either Maryland or California and begin my path towards becoming a lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>What’s Katy Rossino like off the court? </strong>Wow, where to begin. When Katy is not collecting chapstick, she is meticulously grooming her financial savings. When she’s not doing that, she’s pulling a prank on someone; so watch out … Jokes aside, Katy is just as amazing off the court as she is on it. Brilliant, hardworking and my best friend.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/muihs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-980" title="Kimberly Mui" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/muihs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Kimberly Mui</strong></p>
<p><strong>How great did it feel to be able to step back on the court this season? </strong>When I tore my ACL last summer, the hardest thing to comprehend was the fact that I would not be able to be on the court and play with my friends that season. Being able to step back on the court this season was an incredible and indescribable feeling. I have a great passion for basketball, so stepping back on the court with my teammates was amazing, and I’m lucky to have had a successful surgery to be able to play again in my senior year.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s the key to playing tough defense?</strong> Defense has always been my main focus in basketball. I’m a true believer in the saying “Defense wins championships.” I also believe that with good defense comes good offense. I think one of the keys to playing tough defense is to always keep your feet moving and stay lower than your opponent. Being fast and quick also doesn’t hurt 🙂</p>
<p><strong>How many different ways have you heard your name mispronounced? </strong>Over my life, I’ve heard ridiculous mispronunciations of my name. It spans from Moo, Moo-i, Moo-ey, Mwee, to My. I think my favorite is Moo-ey because a lot of people call me that and yell out that name. Also, Moo-ey seems to flow off the tongue. Mew is a funny one too because my freshman year, all the senior basketball players used to call me “Kim Mew for Two.”</p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans? </strong>I’m not exactly sure yet because I still have to send my resume to companies and go on interviews, but I would love to work at a marketing firm somewhere in New York. My dream is to work in the sports industry, like being on the marketing team for the New York Yankees.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s Kathleen Naddaff like off the court? </strong>Kathleen is probably the weirdest person you will ever meet. After living with her this year, I realized that she likes to make weird noises and scream randomly. All kidding aside, Kathleen is one of the most genuine and sweetest people I know. She would do anything for her family, friends and teammates, and that is one of the many things I admire about her. <strong></strong></p>

<p><strong>How would you describe your style of play? </strong>I am definitely a lot more defensive-minded when it comes to my style of play, and I know my role on the team is not to be a leading scorer, but to help the team win with rebounding, boxing out, screening and playing defense. I definitely would say I play to try and make the team better, and I don’t worry about my stats. <em></em></p>
<p><strong>How have you improved since your freshman season? </strong>During my freshman year I was nervous, scared and very hesitant. I looked at all of the teams and thought they were much more experienced than I was, so that intimidated me. I can remember the first game of the Scotty Wood Tournament my freshman year, I literally thought I was going to throw up I was so nervous. Now I go out on the floor with the mindset that no one can guard me or get by me if I tell myself they won’t. I have prided myself on my defense, and if I just concentrate on that and get a few great stops, my offense will come. I am a lot more confident walking out on the court because I have done it many times before.</p>
<p><strong>What’s it like having a father that was drafted by the Indiana Pacers?</strong> I am so proud of my dad, and I look up to him a lot. He and my mom have been such amazing role models in my life. Yes, my father’s shoes are very hard to fill (quite literally), but I know that he has been through a lot and knows the game of basketball. So I really do look up to him and respect everything he has to say.</p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans? </strong>I actually have two job offers right now, with a few more interviews lined up. The job offers are at BE Furniture and BFI Furniture. They are corporate furniture companies in Parsippany, N.J., where I would function as a project manager. I am looking to stay close so I can live at home for a few more years. Mom and Dad are going to love it 🙂<em></em></p>
<p><strong>What kind of teammate is Kimberly Mui? </strong>Kim is not only an amazing teammate, but she is also one of my roommates. Kim really makes me want to be a better teammate, because regardless of what happens, she is there for this team with a smile and encouraging words. I seriously give her all the credit in the world for what she went through last year and how supportive she was throughout the entire year for the team. Kim will cheer every single girl on, and she honestly is not just an amazing teammate but also a great friend.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/rossinohs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-981" title="Katy Rossino" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/rossinohs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Katy Rossino</strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s it feel like knowing you’re in control of the offense as a point guard? </strong>I love being a point guard. There was a time at the beginning of the season when I was nervous about it. To know that I was in control of the offense was a scary thing for me, especially since I hadn’t had that opportunity to see significant minutes since high school. I’ve become a much more vocal player, and have learned so much about each player on our team – where to get them the ball, how they are going to come off a screen, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Have you always been so hesitant to shoot? </strong>I’ve never been one to take 20 shots in a game, but I did shoot more in high school. I’ve always tried to do what I need to help the team. My role has always been to be more of a passer, a provider of comedic relief and, most importantly, a role model to the younger girls. They really look up to me as a mature, inspirational and “larger than life” figure.</p>
<p><strong>What off-the-court accomplishment are you most proud of? </strong>I’m very proud of my work with the Academic Resource Center. I’ve been a tutor all four years at Muhlenberg and have tutored about 25 students in math, finance and accounting classes. I enjoy tutoring because it is an extremely rewarding experience. It’s always great to know that I helped someone succeed in a class. I’ve learned a lot about how to adjust to different learning styles, which is a skill I have been able to use at various financal and accounting internships and plan to use in the future when I start working.</p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans? </strong>Next October I will begin working as an auditor at Deloitte &amp; Touche, a big four public accounting firm, in Boston. I’ll spend the summer studying for the CPA exam and hope to pass all four sections by my start date. Then I hope to transition into my dream job, which is winning the lottery and moving to Europe, where my only responsibilities will be eating and sleeping. <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What kind of person is Alexandra Chili? </strong>Where do I begin? Chili has been my best friend at Muhlenberg since we were freshmen. We spend way too much time together playing basketball, becoming the dominating duo in team ping-pong tournaments, saying “Hey, what’s up” to all the wrong people, and everything in between. She has an extraordinary personality and can make anyone laugh to the point of tears. Sometimes we laugh so much we cry, and then the next morning we have no idea what we laughed about. She’s an unbelievable basketball player, student and friend. I’ve already promised her that I’ll name my first child “Alexander Chilington,” which has been my nickname for her.</p>
