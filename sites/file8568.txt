								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Think about how many times a day you read. From the moment you wake up, you are reading everything from street signs to text messages, from newspapers to billboards. People constantly complain about having to read, despite the fact that reading is extremely crucial to our existence. If no one was able to read, it would be very hard to function in society. Mike Hanksi informs us just how important reading is in his article <i>Want to Be a Better Writer? Read More.</i> Within his opening he states,“Reading is fashionable. Again. It’s cool. We bet you can all find many statements about how good and useful reading is, how much it can influence a person and his way of thinking… ” (Hanski, 2014).</p>
<p>If someone explained to you exactly how to be a great writer, would you listen? If they laid everything out, would you follow through? Hanski does just this. He depicts the sole way to becoming a successful writer is by reading. By doing this, one will become more educated and discover inspiration. Ideas obtained through reading will only increase your ability when writing. Reading can make your brain function stronger; it exercises your mind and circulates blood flow to the brain. From there it continues with reducing the likelihood of contracting Alzheimer’s disease and even makes a person more sympathetic. The benefits of reading are endless, so why would one not take that chance and run with it. It’s a no brainer to utilize reading as a tool to just make your writing exceptional and to improve your quality of life.  Mike quotes famous author Stephen King,“ If you don’t have the time to read, you don’t have the time (or the tools) to write. Simple as that” (Hanski, 2014). Even a well renowned, published author agrees with Hanski that reading is quite an essential aspect of being a great writer.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">       When first starting to read Mike Hanski’s article, the first thing the reader sees is the title in big bold letters, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Want to Be a Better Writer? Read more</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">. Hanski’s persuasion is in full effect in the title. Throughout the article, he lists many different ways that reading can help boost the mind including bringing inspiration, gaining knowledge, and widening vocabulary. Reading gives people an upper edge not just in writing which it does improve greatly but in overall knowledge that you are able to bring to the table in all situations. Knowing more information in various topics will help you be able to engage with many different people from very different backgrounds. Reading more would be beneficial to anyone willing to put in the work. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">        As I first started reading Hanski’s article, I immediately was lured in by his title. I label myself as someone who just reads what he is assigned and does not do any reading for leisure aside from breaking news on my twitter feed and many different types of articles. Who does not want to become a better writer? I clearly do not read enough and this article persuaded me to start reading more than what I am just assigned in school. The influences of reading by itself told me that I should and have to read more. Overcoming stress, keeping the brain in shape while getting older, and broadening of my imagination. Going to a school where writing is very important puts a large emphasis on this article. I need to be a better writer in order to succeed and if I think I am good enough to stop improving, even Stephen King one of the most famous and best selling authors ever credits reading to his writing abilities. “If you don’t have time to read, you don&#8217;t have the time (or the tools) to write. Simple as that,” (P.1) Even Stephen King, a writer with as much ability as he has, reads more to gain inspiration and assist with his writing. Reading is so special because it can help us with so many things and not just writing. Although people may not want to read because it is not convenient or takes up too much time, the benefits are endless and absolutely worth the time it takes. </span></p>
