								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bond, Paul. (2011, April 27). &#8216;Atlas Shrugged&#8217; producer promises two sequels despite terrible reviews, poor box office. <em>The Hollywood Reporter</em>.

The film, based on Ayn Rand&#8217;s long controversial 1957 novel of the same name, opened on April 15. This is probably news to many of this blog&#8217;s readers, and it&#8217;s news to us as well. In writing the novel &#8220;Atlas Shrugged,&#8221; Rand incorporated her philosophical viewpoints into a highly debated novel that has been drawing negative criticism but a devoted fanbase for decades. Rand, a philosopher and author, was known for developing the philosophical system of Objectivism, which advocated reason as the only method of gaining knowledge and emphasized laissez-faire (or hands-off) capitalism in politics. This should sound familiar, as the recent rapid rise of the Tea Party in American politics gave John Aglialoro, a producer/financier, the idea to finally bring a film version of the &#8220;unfilmable&#8221; &#8220;Atlas Shrugged&#8221; to the big screen. However, the film received an atrocious 9% score on Rotten Tomatoes (which measures critics&#8217; reviews), with only 3 positive reviews out of 35 overall. And with middling box office returns added to the public perception of the film, Aglialoro has spoken out against film critics for their hatred of &#8220;individualism&#8221; and stated his plans to make two follow-up films.<span id="more-1164"></span></p>
<p>Unlike most feature films produced through the Hollywood system, Aglialoro spent $10 million of his money to finance the film through an independent studio. &#8220;Atlas Shrugged: Part 1&#8221; also avoided conventional marketing norms and instead concentrated on the Internet and talk radio to get word out about the film and attract a niche audience of those who share Rand&#8217;s political views. Specifically, Aglialoro was hoping to attract Libertarians and Tea Party followers, an effort that seems to have at least partially worked. Despite the critical drubbing and poor box office, Rotten Tomatoes also indicates that 85% of the audience who voted on their website actually recommends the film. However, the film is becoming well-known for some of the harsh reviews it has received. Peter Travers of <em>Rolling Stone</em> gave the movie zero stars and said &#8220;the novel gets the l0w-budget, no-talent treatment and sits there flapping on screen like a bludgeoned seal,&#8221; while Vadim Rizov of <em>Boxoffice Magazine </em>called the film &#8220;lifeless as entertainment and incoherent as ideology.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aglialoro has accused professional film critics of having a political agenda while speaking out about the film. &#8220;It was a nihilistic craze. Not in the history of Hollywood has 16 reviewers said the same low things about a movie. They&#8217;re lemmings. What&#8217;s their fear of Ayn Rand? They hate this woman. They hate individualism,&#8221; he said in this <em>Hollywood Reporter </em>article. Aglialoro also indicated his desire to continue making adaptations of &#8220;Atlas Shrugged,&#8221; both because particular audiences have responded well to it and as a means of spiting the critics. He also acknowledged that future films should most likely have different marketing strategies to expose them to a wider audience, perhaps by partnering with a major studio or spending more money to advertise the films on television and open them on more theaters.</p>
<p>The limited success of &#8220;Atlas Shrugged: Part 1&#8221; with a narrow audience and the completely negative reaction to it from nearly everyone else shows many things about success in the film industry. To attract a broad audience and win the approval of film critics, filmmakers cannot simply rely on a cult audience to bring in profits. While many films in the past saw box office success despite critics&#8217; negative opinions, the reviews on &#8220;Atlas Shrugged: Part 1&#8221; were <em>so </em>bad that it likely deterred many from seeing the film. The lack of traditional marketing also likely contributed to the film&#8217;s failure. Aglialoro concentrated largely on getting fans of the book and Rand&#8217;s followers to come out to see the film, but the focus on this group was so specific that it alienated everyone else. The Internet can be an effective marketing enhancer when a film is already being promoted through print and other forms of mass media; however, it cannot be the sole marketing technique. &#8220;Atlas Shrugged: Part 1,&#8221; true to its title, was met with indifference from the general audience, and it remains to be seen whether Aglialoro&#8217;s hopes for parts 2 and 3 will be met with a similar response or worse&#8230;</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fernandez, Jay A. (2011, April 14). Roundtable: the writers behind summer&#8217;s biggest blockbusters (exclusive video). <em>The Hollywood Reporter. </em>Retrieved from <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/risky-business/roundtable-writers-summers-biggest-blockbusters-177491">http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/risky-business/roundtable-writers-summers-biggest-blockbusters-177491</a><a href="http://mediaindustries11.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/04/2558435938_dc8097fd79.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1106" src="http://mediaindustries11.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/04/2558435938_dc8097fd79-300x260.jpg" alt="" width="184" height="111" /></a></p>
<p>With the summer fast approaching, the pressure on Hollywood screenwriters is beginning to mount. Summer blockbusters or &#8220;tentpoles&#8221;, while not necessarily containing the same topics or plotlines, tend to share a lot of the same elements. Much like the season itself, summer blockbusters are designed by filmmakers and marketed by studios to &#8220;make you cheer, make you gasp, and make you laugh,&#8221; according to Ehren Kruger, screenwriter of <em>Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, </em>in a Hollywood Reporter roundtable discussion with Hollywood screenwriters. These blockbusters are not typically designed to capture the attention of Oscar voters; instead, studios pour countless amounts of money into these films&#8217; budgets in order to regain profits and more. &#8220;These movies are greenlit now based on pre-visualized animated sequences that are the action sequences or moments that are really designed to wow the audience or stand out in a trailer,&#8221; said Kruger. Kruger&#8217;s quote exemplifies how summer blockbusters are designed first and foremost to appeal to a widespread audience. In order to accomplish this, studios look at past moneymakers and formulas that tend to appeal to the masses, and often design these summer blockbusters with these precedents in mind. Fundamentally, the studios are out to maximize profits when making these blockbusters. The main objective isn&#8217;t always necessarily making a film with quality of the highest caliber. Instead, money is what makes the industries continue churning out these massively-budgeted films year after year.<span id="more-1104"></span></p>
<p>When writing these films in the first place, Hollywood screenwriters face pressure to come up with &#8220;fresh&#8221; ideas that will capture the attention of audiences. Additionally, they must keep in mind how their films can function as collaborative efforts with other industries. Cross-promotion is one of the most effective and essential forms of spreading the word about a film and creating a successful summer blockbuster. Cross-promotion is essentially when consumers of one product are targeted, in a marketing sense, by the promotion of another product. Summer blockbusters are well-known in Hollywood as utilizing cross-promotion; as an example, animated films aimed at children are often promoted through toys in kids&#8217; meals at fast food restaurants like McDonald&#8217;s and Burger King.</p>
<p>Similarly, companies often pay studio substantial amounts of money to have their products featured in some way in a film they believe might be popular, a practice known as product placement. A notable example of this is when Hershey paid Steven Spielberg and Universal to feature Reeses&#8217; Pieces in the film <em>E.T.</em>, which paid off when <em>E.T. </em>became a global success. Both cross-promotion and product placement are considered linking pins with the film industry, as money can be made both promoting films and other products in other industries, such as fast food restaurants.</p>
<p>Two upcoming summer blockbusters will use both product placement and forms of cross-promotional merchandising in order to enhance the visibility of these films in the marketplace. The upcoming superhero film <em>Green Lantern</em> will feature a prominent use of product placement. In the film, the main character&#8217;s mode of transportation is a Chevy Volt, a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle that has only been on the market since December 2010. To accomplish this, Chevrolet struck a deal with Warner Bros., <em>Green Lantern</em>&#8216;s studio, to feature the car prominently. This is an example of two separate industries collaborating financially in a mutually beneficial effort.</p>
<p>In terms of cross-promotion, DreamWorks&#8217; upcoming animated sequel <em>Kung Fu Panda 2 </em>will feature plush toys found in McDonalds&#8217; Happy Meals. In the <em>Hollywood Reporter</em> roundtable, the film&#8217;s screenwriter Jonathan Aibel said, &#8220;There&#8217;s nothing wrong with advertising as long as you feel like you&#8217;re not selling out your characters too much and you&#8217;re still being true to them.&#8221; This is likely a common mindset among the various people involved with making and advertising summer blockbusters. While the actual quality of these summer blockbusters is often hit or miss and/or up for debate, the fact remains that producers in the film industry have their eye on financial success. Above all else, the film industry is a business, and people involved with making these summer blockbusters want to make money.</p>

<p>Once upon a time, the task of finding a seat in the theater after the movie had already begun proved to be an impossible task. However, now finding an empty seat is becoming less of a challenge. It has been a grim first quarter of the year for both Hollywood studios and theater owners. For every single weekend of the year thus far, box office revenues have dropped from the equivalent weekends in 2010. At CinemaCon, a convention of the National Association of Theater Owners (NATO) that recently took place in Las Vegas, the box office decline was a prominent topic of conversation.  Not only are consumer habits changing constantly, but last year&#8217;s box office hits &#8220;Avatar&#8221; (2009) and &#8220;Alice in Wonderland&#8221; (2010) drove the box office to record highs during the first half of 2010. And so far this year, there has been a lack of &#8220;event films&#8221; able to rake in large numbers of ticket sales and attract audiences in a way comparable to last year. <span id="more-1062"></span></p>
<p>At CinemaCon, much of the conference&#8217;s discussion has centered around hopes that this summer&#8217;s films will help erase some of the box office deficit. With known properties and sequels such as &#8220;Scream 4,&#8221; &#8220;Fast Five,&#8221; &#8220;Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,&#8221; &#8220;The Hangover Part II,&#8221; &#8220;Cars 2,&#8221; &#8220;Transformers 3,&#8221; and the final installment of &#8220;Harry Potter&#8221; due in theaters between now and July, Hollywood is hoping that moviegoers will be lured back to theaters to see follow-ups to previous successes.  Several of the major studios, including Paramount, DreamWorks, Disney, Warner Bros. and Lionsgate showcased some of their upcoming products at the convention. Sony screened an entire film, the July comedy &#8220;Zookeeper&#8221; starring Kevin James.</p>
<p>CinemaCon, which used to be known as ShoWest, conducted its first-ever conference under that name this year. In an effort to increase studio participation at the conference and encourage attendance among smaller film exhibitors, NATO will begin managing the conference on a non-profit basis. During a time when decreased attendance and other factors have contributed more than ever to box office declines, CinemaCon was an important week for exhibitors as they discussed strategies and changing consumer habits. &#8220;In this day and age, with so many ancillary avenues fighting for the leisure dollar, we have to be at the top of our game,&#8221; said CinemaCon managing director Mitch Neuhauser. &#8220;That&#8217;s really what we&#8217;re keying the conference on: What does it take?&#8221;</p>
<p>As we discussed in our blog last week, a new premium video-on-demand service is proving controversial in the motion picture industry. Making feature films available on demand in a relatively short window following release, this service was a notable point of conversation about CinemaCon. The video-on-demand service is reflective of some of the changes happening within the entertainment industry that could affect how consumers are willing to spend their money. It remains to be seen what kind of impact this specific service will actually have on box office revenues, but it seems clear at this point in time that exhibitors and studios are both counting on the box office receiving a much-needed shot in the arm.</p>
<p>The sheer number of films being released in this summer based on products that previously saw success is an indication that studios are hoping familiarity will bring people back into movie theaters. CinemaCon is a clear example of a power role attempting to maintain their grip on the industry. Exhibitors spent the entire week of CinemaCon discussing the ins and outs of the industry and the current state of box office sales. CinemaCon was an outlet that allowed not only the screening of footage but gave exhibitors and studios a chance to interact. With the common goal of boosting box office and erasing some of the industry&#8217;s current fears, exhibitors and studios used CinemaCon as an opportunity to plan for the future.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Graser, Marc. (2011, March 31). WB, Sony, U, and Fox cue premium VOD. <em>Variety</em>. Retrieved from <a href="http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118034714">http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118034714</a>.<a href="http://mediaindustries11.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/03/video-on-demand-image-photoshop.jpg"><br />
</a></p>
<p><a href="http://mediaindustries11.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/03/home_theter_04-535x354.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1018" src="http://mediaindustries11.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/03/home_theter_04-535x354-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a>In a controversial business venture that could significantly impact the film industry and its audiences, four major film studios have announced their involvement in the launch of Home Premiere, a premium video-on-demand service for feature films. Beginning next month, Warner Bros., Sony, Universal and 20th Century Fox will offer recently released theatrical films for a $30 fee over a two-to-three day viewing period, at the discretion of each particular studio. Several cable systems will offer the service, with DirecTV launching it initially to its 20 million customers. Warner Bros.&#8217; action thriller &#8220;Unknown&#8221; (2011) and Sony&#8217;s romantic comedy &#8220;Just Go With It&#8221; (2011) will be the first major releases offered via Home Premiere. While discussing the reasons this endeavor has come to fruition, studios have argued that offering these films for the $30 rate 60 days after theatrical release will <em>not</em> harm either box office returns or the financial stability of exhibitors, claiming that films make most of their money at the box office within the first three months. Further, these studios claim that the expense of a night out at the movies for families has harmed them financially between the cost of concessions, tickets, and possible babysitters, and this VOD service seeks to appease this by offering an opportunity to view relatively recent films at a cost that would be lower than an average trip to the theater.<span id="more-1016"></span></p>
<p>However, exhibitors and NATO (the National Association of Theater Owners) have expressed disappointment and anger over their fears of this premium VOD plan having a negative effect on theaters. In a statement, a NATO spokesman recently said, &#8220;They risk damaging theatrical revenues without actually delivering what  the home consumer seems to want, which is flexibility, portability and a  low price. These plans fundamentally alter the economic relationship  between exhibitors, filmmakers and producers, and the studios taking  part in this misguided venture.&#8221; In other words, a prominent concern of the exhibition viewpoint of the industry regards possible repercussions this new service could have on theatrical box office revenues.</p>
<p>Several theater chains, including Regal Entertainment, have threatened studios with the possibility of not releasing particular films if they are released on demand just six weeks after opening. Hypothetically, if Regal were to actually go through with this, it would have a devastating effect on nearly all theatrical grosses, as Regal is the largest theater chain in the U.S. When DirecTV initially proposed the VOD launch in February, they had mentioned the possibility of a short four-to-six week window between theatrical release and VOD release. This was when Regal threatened a boycott, and the four major studios had to intervene and talk DirecTV into lengthening the window to 60 days.</p>
<p>This is a striking example of power roles at work in the industry of motion pictures. In terms of the agreement to extend the window to 60 days from roughly 40, the exhibitors wielded their power over the distributors. Without the cooperation of Regal, the nation&#8217;s most prominent movie exhibitor chain, the studios would stand to lose millions of dollars in this risky endeavor. Although the exhibitors and NATO still seem unsure of Home Premiere&#8217;s possible financial implications, they are nonetheless on board with it, at least for now. It remains to be seen what the future holds for this new service, and whether it will be profitable overall or a financial bust. In the meantime, however, the fight between the different entities involved (specifically the exhibitors and distributors) has revealed a great deal of the number of compromises that go on behind the scenes in the motion picture industry.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Kin<a href="http://mediaindustries11.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/03/The-Kings-Censored-Speech.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-972" src="http://mediaindustries11.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/03/The-Kings-Censored-Speech-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a>g&#8217;s Speech,&#8221; the most recent winner of the Academy Award for Best Picture, will undergo a ratings facelift on Friday, April 1. The Weinstein Co., the film&#8217;s distributing studio, announced that they will replace all R-rated prints of the film currently in theaters with a brand new PG-13 version. Starting next Friday, this teen-friendly version of the film will play in approximately 1,000 theaters nationwide. This is the first time a film has been released in theaters with a new rating since 1978&#8217;s &#8220;Saturday Night Fever,&#8221; although in the case of that film, the new PG version (downgraded from R) was released in theaters months later. In the case of &#8220;The King&#8217;s Speech,&#8221; which is still playing in wide release, the studio is simply pulling the current R-rated version from theaters and replacing all prints with this new PG-13 version. The Motion Picture Association of America, which is responsible for designating the ratings of films, originally gave &#8220;The King&#8217;s Speech&#8221; an R rating for &#8220;some language.&#8221; The reedited PG-13 version is so rated because of &#8220;language.&#8221; In the PG-13 cut, numerous uses of the &#8220;F-bomb&#8221; have either been muted or replaced with &#8220;s*it.&#8221;<span id="more-970"></span></p>
<p>In late February, MPAA chair Bob Pisnano and NATO (National Association of Theater Owners) president John Fithian co-signed a waiver permitting the Weinstein Co. to release this new version <em>without</em> the standard provision that it be released 90 days after the R-rated version was pulled from theaters. Prior to a few years ago, the possibility of this waiver did not exist, so &#8220;The King&#8217;s Speech&#8221; is the first time the waiver has been employed by a film studio. It seems clear the Weinstein Co. has made the effort to release a PG-13 version of the film in hopes of attracting more widespread revenue. An R rating limits film patrons under the age of 17 to only being sold a ticket when in the presence of a parent or guardian. With a PG-13 rating, however, no age limit exists in terms of ticket sales.</p>
<p>This re-rating seems to indicate the tremendous power role that the studio holds. It seems that, at least in this particular case, the studio is more interested in obtaining as much profit as possible rather than the film&#8217;s art. Not only did &#8220;The King&#8217;s Speech&#8221; receive extensive critical acclaim and win the Best Picture Oscar in its original form, but it also was very successful financially (the film has grossed $132.7 million in the United States already). From a logical standpoint, there seems to be no reason for the existence of the PG-13 version. The subject matter of &#8220;The King&#8217;s Speech&#8221; is inherently adult and, at least on first glance, it doesn&#8217;t seem like allowing teenagers to see the film unaccompanied will really change the film&#8217;s fortunes a considerable amount. The DVD is also scheduled for release on April 19, less than three weeks after the PG-13 re-release, perhaps further muting box office returns. The Weinstein Co.&#8217;s actions could have extensive repercussions throughout the film industry. If the PG-13 re-release of the film is at all successful, it may give studios incentives to lobotomize the content of future films in order to gain more audience-friendly ratings. What&#8217;s more, this issue seems to be stirring a debate regarding the preservation of the film&#8217;s original content. The filmmakers of &#8220;The King&#8217;s Speech&#8221; intended for the film to be seen in its original R rating, and some have spoken out against changing the film&#8217;s content, such as the film&#8217;s star Geoffrey Rush. Our group believes this change in the film&#8217;s rating to be some  &#8220;bull&#8230;&#8221; Censorship should not stand, and filmmakers should be able to have their content embraced by audiences in the way dictated by the creators themselves, not the studios.</p>

Retrieved from http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/why-disneys-mars-needs-moms-167551.<a href="http://mediaindustries11.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/03/images.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-949" src="http://mediaindustries11.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/03/images.jpg" alt="" width="177" height="245" /></a></p>
<p>On Friday, March 11, Disney unveiled its latest animated theatrical release, the 3D motion-capture film &#8220;Mars Needs Moms.&#8221; The film was a production of the animation company ImageMovers, whose past works have included box office successes such as &#8220;The Polar Express&#8221; (2004) and &#8220;A Christmas Carol&#8221; (2009). Headed by acclaimed director Robert Zemeckis, ImageMovers specializes in a type of technology known as performance capture. This technology involves shooting films as if they&#8217;re live action and then converting them to animation in post-production. After the worldwide success of &#8220;The Polar Express,&#8221; Disney acquired ImageMovers in 2007, with hopes of imprinting its brand on part of their animated division. &#8220;Mars Needs Moms,&#8221; a story of a young boy who must battle against Martians after they have kidnapped his mother, is the company&#8217;s latest release. However, Disney&#8217;s hopes for financial success with the film were dashed when it took in a miniscule $6.9 million opening weekend, despite expensive 3D surcharges associated with ticket prices. With a budget of over $200 million including production and marketing expenses, Disney will now likely be swimming in red ink trying to recover costs of the ill-fated production.<span id="more-948"></span></p>
<p>In the weeks leading up to the film&#8217;s release, tracking figures had suggested that the film would not be a blockbuster and had tepid interest at best. However, Disney was still unprepared for the shockingly low figures that came in last weekend. According to <em>The Hollywood Reporter</em>, &#8220;<em>Mars </em>was always designed to open in the $20-30 million range. When tracking showed the film was in serious trouble, Disney downgraded its forecast. As the toon opened, Disney braced themselves for a $10 million opening. Even that turned out to be too optimistic.&#8221; Despite their disappointment at the film&#8217;s disastrous opening weekend, Disney may have had an inkling they would lose money on it. In March 2010, after first screening &#8220;Mars Needs Moms,&#8221; Disney dropped their association with ImageMovers. Still, Disney decided to release the film theatrically instead of shelving it completely or trying to sell the film&#8217;s distribution rights to another studio. It is likely Disney did this because they thought it would be more cost-effective to release the film themselves and simply cut future losses by eliminating their ties with ImageMovers.</p>
<p>In terms of the recent development of motion capture animation, ImageMovers perhaps had hoped their technology alone would suffice as a selling point for audiences. This rang true for &#8220;The Polar Express,&#8221; which was the first major motion picture to capitalize on the motion capture technology. Although there were other factors associated with that film&#8217;s popularity, such as a magical Christmas theme and the presence of actor Tom Hanks, the technology itself also likely contributed to the film&#8217;s success because it was considered revolutionary at the time. With &#8220;Mars Needs Moms,&#8221; however, the film&#8217;s technology was hardly promoted in its advertising, there was no star power associated with the film, and its awkward title likely turned off many viewers, especially the target audience of young boys. &#8220;The title shouldn&#8217;t have been &#8220;Mars Needs Moms,&#8221; but &#8220;Boys Need Not Come,&#8221; said an anonymous studio executive quoted in <em>The Hollywood Reporter</em>. Furthermore, the financial misfire of &#8220;Mars Needs Moms&#8221; comes on the heels of other space-related children&#8217;s pictures that also saw poor box office returns. Summit Entertainment&#8217;s 2009 film &#8220;Astro Boy&#8221; ($19.6 million total) and 20th Century Fox&#8217;s 2009 film &#8220;Aliens in the Attic&#8221; ($25.2 million total) did not provide encouraging results for films with this type of subject matter, and &#8220;Mars Needs Moms&#8221; has continued the unprofitable trend. If studios make an effort to revive the motion capture technology, despite Disney breaking its association with it, they may need to go back to the drawing board in order to create products that audiences actually want to see.</p>

(2011, February 25). Reporters, publicists play game year-round. <em>Variety</em>. Retrieved from <a href="http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118032485?refcatid=1985">http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118032485?refcatid=1985</a>.</p>
<p>A new development in the relationship between Hollywood publicists and news journalists has heightened to a new level, regardless of the time of year. Publicists and news journalists often have agendas of different sorts; while publicists want to promote positive images of their clients, news journalists are constantly trying to find new stories, no matter what type of light is shed on the subjects of the investigation. In years prior, however, Hollywood publicists and entertainment journalists&#8217; goals would often converge during awards season. In the period of time from October to late February, in which all eyes and ears are focused on the &#8220;awards-season beast,&#8221; publicists and reporters often came to an unspoken agreement featuring &#8220;exclusives and firsts taking a backseat to smarter analysis and better access.&#8221; According to several of Hollywood&#8217;s leading publicity honchos, however, this temporary standstill in the conflicting interests of the two groups no longer exists. Reporting on important film news related to the awards race during the actual season is now commonplace. An example of this occurred last year, when news stories regarding <em>The Hurt Locker</em> producer Nicolas Chartier being banned from attending the awards as a result of an email blasting <em>Avatar</em> quickly circulated throughout the industry in the runup to the Oscars.<span id="more-916"></span></p>
<p>The advent of online technology and the role it has played in journalism has played an enormous role in the development of this year-long news cycle. According to Steve Elzer, senior VP of media relations at Sony Pictures Entertainment, &#8220;there is no question that the proliferation of blogs and online journalism has put enormous new pressure on publicists and journals alike.&#8221; Bloggers and online journalists&#8217; sole goal is often to report on the events of the industry, and the advent of social networking websites like Twitter makes it quite easy to keep up with current events of the entertainment world on a minute-by-minute basis. Because of the constant access to the industry&#8217;s developments, publicists and journalists must now both be on guard and vigilant in their pursuits throughout the calendar year, no longer having a break during the so-called &#8220;awards season.&#8221; This change in the publicity &#8220;game&#8221; within the film industry is reflective of the demands of mainstream society as a whole. As more and more technologies come to the forefront, the demand for the newest information at any time and in multiple capacities has increased exponentially.</p>
<p>In terms of power roles, journalists and publicists both fit into the &#8220;facilitator&#8221; role. Publicists are facilitators of the promotion of their clients&#8217; images both to the public and the industry itself. Journalists can be considered facilitators, as well, because they must relay information about newsworthy material to the public. There is often a substantial divide between the goals of publicists and journalists, especially in the film industry, as both groups are facilitators but attempting to facilitate entirely different types of information. According to Stan Rosenfield, a personal publicist who has handled Oscar campaigns for clients such as George Clooney and Helen Mirren, &#8220;journalists want certain stories from us, and when they don&#8217;t get (them), they are not happy with us. But if you want to be good at what you do, you need to have a meaningful relationship with the press.&#8221; When two separate entities like publicists and journalists, who play the same power role have conflicting interests but often have to work together, a &#8220;co-dependency&#8221; often emerges in the film industry. As the Oscar season continues, this relationship is often necessary in order to establish the facilitation efforts of both parties.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Powers, Lindsay. (2011, February 17). Redbox taking on netflix with new digital streaming movie service. <em>The Hollywood Reporter</em>.   Retrieved from <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/redbox-taking-netflix-new-digital-100543" target="_blank">http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/redbox-taking-netflix-new-digital-100543</a>.<a href="http://mediaindustries11.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/02/gamefly-redbox.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-843" src="http://mediaindustries11.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/02/gamefly-redbox-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a></p>
<p>In an era when media industries must constantly adapt to developing technologies and consumer desires, DVD rental company Redbox will soon be making technology-based improvements in an effort to compete with its rival Netflix. Redbox, known for its compact, bright red kiosks stationed by grocery store and gas station exits, works by vending DVDs to customers at a rate of $1 per day via credit card. According to Redbox president Mitch Lowe, the company will begin offering a subscription-based streaming Internet service by the end of this year. For a monthly fee, Redbox will soon offer on-demand movie access online in addition to continuing their kiosk services. Netflix, widely perceived as Redbox&#8217;s main competitor, currently draws in 20 million subscribers per year with its convenient online and mail delivery services. As media companies are often devising strategies to remain financially successful and keep up with their competitors, Redbox is hoping to expand its consumer base and cater to individuals who want an expedient service with the least amount of human communication possible.<span id="more-839"></span></p>
<p>With the recent successes of the Nook and the Kindle in the book industry, exhibitors in the motion picture/DVD industry have taken notice and are seeking a broader audience for their products. A relatively new company founded in 2003, Redbox currently does not have any registered customers in the way a company like Netflix does because of its lack of a subscription service. With the changes the company is making, however, Redbox will soon have customers who pay a monthly fee and are known to the company. As American consumers have become increasingly tech-savvy, the simple option of procuring a DVD from a kiosk may not suffice for either the company or the customers in the near future. <!--more--></p>
<p>As a trade-off for making its services more accessible to customers, it is likely that Redbox&#8217;s fees will increase for customers. This challenge represents a potential financial difficulty for the company. However, increasing surcharges at the expense of customer convenience is a common trend that can be found in an industry like the motion picture/DVD world. Redbox is gambling on the hope that customers will accept elevated costs for more convenience, especially as they are making the effort to compete with Netflix. By implementing changes that allow for online streaming and require customers to subscribe to its services, Redbox&#8217;s aim is no doubt to establish themselves as a dominant force in the industry.</p>

<p>In case you have been living underneath a rock for the past two years, you have heard of &#8216;tween&#8217; singing sensation Justin Bieber. Attracting the hearts and minds of young girls in a way perhaps not seen since the heyday of &#8216;NSync and The Backstreet Boys, &#8220;Bieber fever&#8221; has covered the nation in a shockingly short amount of time. Aside from his millions of CDs sold, Paramount Pictures is hoping Bieber&#8217;s popularity will translate into cinematic success with this Friday&#8217;s release of the 3D &#8220;biopic-concert hybrid&#8221; <em>Justin Bieber: Never Say Never</em>. After the box office success of recent concert films like <em>Hannah Montana: Best of Both Worlds </em>(2008) and <em>Michael Jackson&#8217;s This Is It </em>(2009), studios have struck gold with this specific storytelling formula that attracts both film and music fans.</p>
<p>The trailer for the film can be viewed at this link:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COJCN3Mhr14">Never Say Never Official Trailer (HD)</a><span id="more-759"></span></p>
<p>A marketing technique that has gained prominence in the film industry in recent years involves targeting Christian religious communities. Recent successes of this technique have included Mel Gibson&#8217;s <em>The Passion of the Christ </em>(2004) and <em>The Blind Side </em>(2009). While <em>The Passion of the Christ</em> blatantly displayed its religious undertones and caused controversy as a result, <em>The Blind Side</em>&#8216;s thematic undertones of Christian beliefs brought a more subtle emphasis on faith and values. In an effort to appeal to Christians and religious groups, Paramount has recently held screenings of <em>Never Say Neve</em><em>r</em> for faith leaders and handed out spiritual discussion guides. According to an article in <em>The Hollywood Reporter</em>, these discussion guides makes the claim that the film &#8220;provides an opportunity to teach our children about the power of hope, prayer, faith and family.&#8221; One pastor who attended a screening of the film echoed this, saying that he wants to use the film as a discussion facilitator of &#8220;how authority and responsibility go hand in hand.&#8221;</p>
<p><!--more-->While it remains to be seen how well <em>Justin Bieber: Never Say Never</em> will perform at the box office, Paramount is hoping to expand its audience beyond a core market of tween girls. By targeting family-oriented groups through emphasizing the film&#8217;s religious aspects, the studio&#8217;s marketing team is praying for heavenly financial returns.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, January 25, the Academy Award nominations were announced in Hollywood. While many people wake up at the crack of dawn to see the nominees for the Oscars&#8217; biggest categories, one category that remains essential but is consistently overlooked is Best Film Editing. This year&#8217;s nominees are Jon Harris for &#8220;127 Hours,&#8221; Andrew Weisblum for &#8220;Black Swan,&#8221; Pamela Martin for &#8220;The Fighter,&#8221; Tariq Anwar for &#8220;The King&#8217;s Speech&#8221; and Angus Wall &amp; Kurt Baxter for &#8220;The Social Network.&#8221; What sets these nominees apart from past years is the complete reality of the nominated films that allows for audiences to become &#8220;totally immersed.&#8221; As more films are produced every year, an editor&#8217;s task becomes increasingly difficult as they must take innovative approaches to presenting films with familiar plot lines.</p>
<p><span id="more-710"></span>Although films are written by the screenwriter, a huge part of the creator power role relies on the abilities of the editor. Every shot seen by paying audiences is cut and pasted by those individuals. Their work, that like these nominees, is what capitalizes on the emotions of the audiences and continues to bring them into theaters even after the Academy Awards are over. The Academy Awards&#8217; role in the industry is the exhibitor. For instance, at last year&#8217;s Academy Awards the Best Picture category held 10 nominees instead of the usual 5 in order to have more people watch the show and generate higher profits for viewings afterward. This is a great benefit to the motion picture industry because even though it is only the category of Best Picture that&#8217;s expanded, the fruits of the editors labors will be appreciated as well.  <!--more--></p>
<p>Since editing is so crucial to a successful film, why don&#8217;t people usually know who editors are? Can you even name the editor of your favorite film? Most likely, you can probably name the actors, perhaps even the director and the screenwriter. However, being able to name a film&#8217;s editor is far less likely. Throughout film history, editors have served as the backbone of feature films, working to ensure that films come together in a way that allows for cinematic impacts. Since their roles are almost always in a behind the scenes capacity, editors have not been given the recognition they often deserve. During the Oscar telecast this year, it is likely the only editor viewers would see would be the actual winner, with a high probability of music cutting off their speech. Although it is the actors and advertisements that typically draw viewers to films in the first place, it is the work of the faceless people behind the scenes that keep the motion picture industry running. <!--more--></p>
<p>On Sunday, February 27, when you tune in for the Oscars, don&#8217;t tune out the editors.</p>
