								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In googling myself, I came across many things that weren&#8217;t me. I typed &#8220;Matthew Stark&#8221; directly into Google using a private window to minimize tracking. I apparently have a Wikipedia page and many Facebook accounts. These are not me because I do not have Facebook and I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m quite famous enough to have a Wikipedia page dedicated solely to me. It might also help that I&#8217;m not a civil rights activist born in 1930.</p>
<p>The amount of content on the page is low but that is to be expected because I doubt anyone googles me/him. Another thing I found that is embarrassing in a way is a doctor of the same name from Oregon. According toÂ <em>Health Grades, Inc.</em> (<a href="https://www.healthgrades.com/provider/matthew-stark-gj2jw">link</a> to page), he&#8217;s rated 1 star. This guy comes up 5th on Google (not including the images section) and, as one customer put it, &#8220;[h]<span>e rushes through the visit, dismisses complaints and obviously doesn&#8217;t understand the importance of patient /Doctor relationships.</span>&#8221; I guess my chances of moving to Oregon are gone.</p>
<p>The amount of entries that aren&#8217;t me is astounding. I couldn&#8217;t find myself because I&#8217;m probably one of the last of the 20.9 million results for my name because I don&#8217;t put anything out there on myself. I probably should get to doing that but I&#8217;m nervous to do so. I don&#8217;t want to end up not getting a job because of one social media blunder like you see in the news. By googling myself, it makes me wonder how Muhlenberg found me, if they did, online.</p>
