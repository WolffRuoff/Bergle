					<description><![CDATA[Really interesting example here, Group 2 - You&#039;re absolutely right that ClearChannel is attempting to branch off into the exhibition space of online radio by purchasing Thumbplay.  Your power role analysis here is good.  One thing seems implicit in this move but not actually stated: with the $9.99/month subscription fee, this looks to be a move by ClearChannel to compete with Siruis/XM, since the business model is the same.  How will the signal be distributed to iHeartRadio, I wonder?  Will the signal be sent over the airwaves on one of the new digital FM radio signals that are pumped out by ClearChannels FM stations?  If so, then ClearChannel&#039;s huge swath of stations around the country represent an advantage over all other group station owners, because it might be able to guarantee iHeartRadio subscribers access to a signal from wherever they are in the country (something that only satellite radio has been able to offer until now).  Very interesting - I hope you will follow some of these new developments.  Thanks for the blog post!]]></description>
