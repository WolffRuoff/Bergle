								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>St.Patrick&#8217;s day here at Muhlenberg was quite a success. We couldn&#8217;t have asked for a better day either. My room mate came back into the room from his first class proclaiming how lovely it was outside.  The campus was a good half green today and the bookstore had on display loads of Irish garb. The beautiful weather was getting to a few people&#8217;s heads. As I was walking back from my last class someone was blasting Margaritaville out their window. I know it feels amazing to emerge from the icy depths of winter&#8217;s fickle grasp, but seriously, it was only like 50 degrees outside.</p>
<p>For someone who is solar powered like me, today was kinda like coming out of a long hibernation. This whole week has been getting progressively nicer in terms of weather, and that upward trend in temperature can only serve as a memento that summer is approaching faster than any of us realize.</p>
<p>I know, it sounds like I&#8217;m getting a little ahead of myself, but really I have less than 2 months left before I&#8217;m done with my freshman year of college. It might not feel so quick to you readers who have only had these snapshots of my time here, but it does to me. To any of you prospectives out there, trust me, as you get older your years slip by faster and faster. It&#8217;s not that I&#8217;m not enjoying my time, I have had enough experiences to make up a full school year, but it seems as though college has acted as a catalyst for the binding of memories to the story of my life, and in just 2 months it&#8217;s going to release the finished product from its active site. I&#8217;m not going to apologize for that analogy, I&#8217;m a biochemistry major. As I enter another cycle of tests, I&#8217;ll keep you all posted on the happenings here at &#8216;berg. Perhaps I&#8217;ll get the chance to video the gospel choir in our weekend concert this Saturday. If you&#8217;re in the allentown area, come on down and see us at the chapel at 7:30. It&#8217;s going to be awesome!</p>
