Thanks to Center for Ethics funding, wine and cheese made the conversation that much livelier. (The subject of open access dovetails nicely with marketplace ethics, the theme of this year&#8217;s Center for Ethics programming.)<\/p>\n<p>At the meeting, several important questions were addressed: Just what is\u00a0<strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.arl.org\/sparc\/openaccess\/why-oa.shtml\">open access<\/a><\/strong>? How have other institutions such as\u00a0<strong><a href=\"http:\/\/osc.hul.harvard.edu\/policies\">Harvard<\/a><\/strong>\u00a0and our neighbor\u00a0<strong><a href=\"http:\/\/library.lafayette.edu\/help\/oa\">Lafayette<\/a><\/strong>\u00a0encouraged open access to their faculty&#8217;s pubications? Is there anything Muhlenberg could or should be doing?<\/p>\n<p>The conversation covered common justifications for OA:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<ul>\n<li>the increasing cost of academic journals, translating into huge profit margins for publishers like Elsevier<\/li>\n<li>the ethical imperative to make scholarly publishing more widely available, especially research that has been funded by taxpayer dollars<\/li>\n<li>the lack of exposure that academic authors get for their work through traditional subscription models.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/ul>\n<p>and concerns about OA:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<ul>\n<li>the cost of publication has the potential to fall back on the author or institution<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/ul>\n<p>What are your thoughts about open access?<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>ALA President vs. President of Authors Guild<\/strong><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The president of ALA, Maureen Sullivan, in a recent\u00a0<strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2013\/04\/11\/opinion\/libraries-and-authors.html?ref=opinion&amp;_r=1&amp;\">letter to the editor<\/a><\/strong>\u00a0of the New York Times, responded to an earlier\u00a0<strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2013\/04\/08\/opinion\/the-slow-death-of-the-american-author.html\">op-ed<\/a><\/strong>\u00a0penned by the president of the Authors Guild, Scott Turow. Where Turow had argued that libraries&#8217; circulation of e-books to the public undermines author profits, Sullivan retorted just as passionately that library circulation actually increases profits of authors by promoting interest in their books.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately neither side presented any data specific to e-books. Perhaps it&#8217;s too early to know what effect public lending of e-books will have, or if publishers and libraries can negotiate a licensing model satisfying to all parties concerned.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>NITLE Webinar<\/strong><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Upcoming NITLE webinar hosted in Trexler Library, rm.
