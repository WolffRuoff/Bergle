					<description><![CDATA[Really interesting post here, Group 1.  In a sense, Glee is now being utilized as a powerful linking pin between different media industries - from television to the radio and recording industries.  The link between television and the recording industry is a long-standing one, of course.  You just have to look back at the history of programs like American Bandstand, Soul Train, and other weekly pre-MTV television offerings to see the tight marketing of musical acts via different media (even the Beatles film &quot;A Hard Day&#039;s Night&quot; nicely points toward the kind of cross-promotion extravaganza that is being capitalized by the producers of Glee (and American Idol).  Nice link to the Sony payola investigation - it&#039;s weird to think back, but there was Then-NY Attorney General Eliot Spitzer in 2005 calling out Sony&#039;s backroom deals with radio stations...A lot can change in 6 years!]]></description>
