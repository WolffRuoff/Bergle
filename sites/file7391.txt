					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;The in class discussion and Watter&#039;s paper helped educate me on how the internet uses us. They use our lack of knowledge to help promote their sites. It is honestly a genius plan because like you said, we feel like we are in control of our social media site and presence because we control what we post and who we follow. However, with the settings and features, social media pushes manipulates us into promoting different topics or ideas that benefit the site. However, because we feel like we have control, we don&#039;t understand how much of choice content that is posted is really persuaded by the site itself.&lt;/p&gt;
