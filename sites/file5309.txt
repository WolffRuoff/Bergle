								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve gotten the chance to speak with a number of Muhlenberg community members who saw the show &#8211; first years, faculty, and other students &#8211; all of whom were really invested in getting involved somehow. To you (and those of you who I haven&#8217;t gotten to talk to yet), good! That passion and hunger for equality is what keeps all of us going. I keep saying the same things to these people and I&#8217;ll say it here: Keep talking about it. Talk to your friends about these things, tell them to talk to their friends. Talk to your professors and to administrators and to the dining workers and the janitors and the religious leaders.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a concrete way to get involved, visit the Multicultural Center, email one of us, join an affinity group (even if you don&#8217;t necessarily belong to that group! You don&#8217;t have to be a minority to support a minority group). The Activities Fair is this Saturday, where a lot of those groups will make themselves known, so check that out!</p>
<p>Just because the play is over doesn&#8217;t mean that we&#8217;re finished. Keep talking and fighting for freedom.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This afternoon&#8217;s showing to RAs (Residential Advisors) and SAs (Student Advisors who lead groups of first years through Orientation Weekend) went beautifully. During the talkback afterward, a wonderful young man asked each member to explain why they wanted to be involved in SDP, and what they hoped each audience member would take away from the project. We ran out of time before all of us could answer, and so I am posting my response here:</p>
<p><strong>Why get involved with this?</strong></p>
<p>For those who don&#8217;t know me, I&#8217;m a white, straight, upper-middle class male. My only salient minority identity is the fact that I&#8217;m Jewish. So I have a enormous amount of privilege. My first year at Muhlenberg, I just sort of coasted by, absent in conversations on diversity, partially because I didn&#8217;t know they were there. But a lot of my friends were active in them. So I knew they existed, I just never thought that they had to do with me. I auditioned for the play going into sophomore year, and made it as an alternate that was never called upon.<br />
I wish I could pinpoint the moment where I realized how important this all was. I remember my mind exploding when I saw SDP as a first year, and I&#8217;d like to think that it had just been incubating since. But some point during sophomore year, I got involved. I started going to SQuAd meetings (Students for Queer Advocacy) and Muhlenberg&#8217;s Feminist Collective. I also interviewed and got into a group called Peer 2 Peer, which exists to facilitate conversations around diversity. I took a class on Gender and Sexuality in Judaism. I saw SDP my sophomore year. I saw the Vagina Monologues. I&#8217;ve had the fortune to be in a relationship with somebody who also cares about this stuff. I started my own blog (which I don&#8217;t think I can solicit here) so that I had a space to put all my ideas on these and other subjects. And somewhere inside this fire burned, this <em>need</em> to be active in these discussions.</p>
<p>I tried out again and made it. And it was one of the greatest experiences of my life.</p>
<p><strong>What do you hope people take away from it?</strong></p>
<p>As a white, straight, upper-middle class male, I came into these talks not knowing what to do with my privilege. The hope is that this project shows some ways to do that. But what I most want people to take away from this is that <strong><em>you</em> can be active in these discussions.</strong>  Yes, you reading this right now! All of you.You have power, the ability to change someone&#8217;s mind for the better. You won&#8217;t always be right, and you&#8217;ll make mistakes often. But that&#8217;s okay! Mistakes are fine as long as you learn from them. Go out there and engage with people! Challenge yourself! Fight for freedom for all people.</p>

		<title>Intersectionality: What it is and Why it&#8217;s Important</title>

				<description><![CDATA[Hey all! I thought it was about time we starting defining things.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey all! I thought it was about time we starting defining things. You&#8217;ll hear some of these terms in the play, so consider these additional or alternate definitions:</p>
<p>Intersectionality is the idea that all of our identities inform our life experience, and that the way they interact is unique for every person. As an example, I&#8217;m a white Jewish male. So my experience would be different than a white Christian male&#8217;s even though we are both white men. The same goes for any aspect of identity: sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, you name it.</p>
<p>Another really important thing to take away is the fact that these multiple identities might mean that you have power in some facets of your life, but don&#8217;t in others. Continuing with me as an example, I have a lot of social power because I&#8217;m white, but the fact that I&#8217;m Jewish means that I&#8217;m also part of a historically oppressed minority group, and I lack power because of that.</p>
<p>However, do not take this to mean that a black male&#8217;s experience is equal to a white female&#8217;s experience. It isn&#8217;t as easy and mathematical as that (trust me, I&#8217;m a math major).</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll continue to talk about it throughout the year, so this is merely a heads-up. See y&#8217;all soon!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sorry for the silence! We&#8217;ve been hard at work trying to make the best work of art possible for you guys (and girls (and gender-non-conforming individuals)). In fact, tonight is our final rehearsal before we start performing in front of audiences! We&#8217;ve gotten basically everything down; it&#8217;s just a matter of polishing and fine tuning some things.</p>
<p>However! Though this show is created primarily for you first-years, that doesn&#8217;t mean that other people can&#8217;t see it. We will be having a community showing a week from today, Sunday the 25th, at 10 PM. I highly encourage every Muhlenberg community member to try and come see it. It&#8217;s really important.</p>
<p>Well, back to work for me. See y&#8217;all soon!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello all! I thought that it would benefit y&#8217;all to know what exactly we&#8217;re up to over here at &#8216;Berg. So! Here&#8217;s how it works.</p>
<p><strong>Interviews</strong></p>
<p>We begin by interviewing members of the Muhlenberg community. This includes students, faculty members, working staff, administration, and anyone else we can find. All the ensemble members sit down and interview this person, which usually lasts anywhere from 20 minutes to an hour and 20 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>Transcriptions</strong></p>
<p>One of the ensemble members is assigned the interview to transcribe. This usually takes muuuuuch longer than the actual interview. I made the hilarious-in-retrospect-but-not-at-the-time mistake of transcribing my <em>entire</em> first interview, including stupid jokes, laughter, and a laundry buzzer.</p>
<p><strong>Review</strong></p>
<p>Every weeknight, we all gather in the Rehearsal House to go over whatever transcriptions we have. We project them onto a screen and go through them line by line, agreeing and disagreeing on what we think should go into the final script. This is where we currently are in the process.</p>
<p><strong>Scriptbuilding</strong></p>
<p>Soon, we&#8217;ll take all of the lines we like and hash them into a proto-script. Then we&#8217;ll cut it, cut it some more, continue to cut it, do some more removal of lines, cut it a final time, and have a script.</p>
<p><strong>Theater Things</strong></p>
<p>After that we&#8217;ll divide up lines, memorize them, block the show, and then it&#8217;s performance time!</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s how it goes. Can&#8217;t wait to see you all!</p>
