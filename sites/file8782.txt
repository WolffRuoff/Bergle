								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In Mike Hanski’s “Want to Be a Better Writer? Read More”, there is no simpler equation of how achieve greatness in the realm of writing. At first glance, the title seems almost too straight forward to be believable, but in fact it is as simple a solution as it seems. Writing goes hand in hand with reading and can most simply be explained by Steven Wright’s statement that “somehow the reading gear in your head turns the writing gear”. Even though it is hard to believe that Hanski could have given away the secret ingredient to better reading in the just the title of an article it is in fact true, but you must be asking yourself where are the facts to back up this seemingly black and white solution. Not only has reading been proven to better prepare kids for school, widen vocabulary, and help students remember grammar rules, but it has the power to help us better understand ourselves. Hanski urges readers to not only go through the motions of reading but to dive into subject matter that is stimulating that way it is more likely that stimulating writing will follow. It is easy to fall back on the saying that practice makes perfect but it is made clear that “only reading can help you achieve greatness”. By reading of not only what interests us at the moment but also what might be utterly unfamiliar we are able to gain insight into who we are as a person. Our interests broaden with reading and the mold of what makes us who we are emergers. Reading is the ingredient to being able to translate this onto paper. The ever so simple equation is balanced in the end and can even make us wonder if reading alone can not only lead us to being better writers but better people.</span></p>
