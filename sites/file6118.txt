								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Did you know that as you age, you experience time to move faster and faster? How you perceive time depends on how old you are; how much living you’ve done before. The second year of your life seems a lot longer than the hundredth, because in a year you’ve gained 50% of your history instead of only 1%. It’s all quite fascinating.</p>
<p>It’s funny. This year, all of the alumni, seniors, juniors and even sophomores I’ve met have one thing in common to say: “Cherish your four years. They will be gone before you know it.” Whenever I’ve heard this, I politely nod and sympathize with their statement, understanding quantitatively how time is perceived to move at a faster rate. Yet, I don’t think I truly understood.</p>
<p>It’s something about college. It is such a whirlwind experience. When you come to college, the amount of things you’re involved in, people you know, and information you’re exposed to increases tenfold. Each day is a life-changing experience, and let me tell you: It has absolutely flown by. In your first year of college, you don’t just age to be a year older. You grow to be many years wiser. You make the transition from high school kid to young adult.</p>
<p>After taking a post-finals-week breath, and reflecting on who I was a year ago…. I think I can definitively say that I’ve made that transition.</p>
<p>Thank you, Muhlenberg. See you in the fall.</p>

		<title>Life Lessons from Design</title>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This semester, I’m taking <em>Design for the Theatre</em>. My professor is one of those people you know has done a lot of living, and has a very enlightened perspective on things. Though the class’ emphasis is (guess what!) on design, my professor never fails to supply me and my classmates with valid and inspiring knowledge applicable to greater life experiences. For my post today, I would like to share some of these lessons with you:</p>
<p>Engage your mind more than anything you could imagine.</p>
<p>Surprise is motivated by contrast.</p>
<p>Don’t say “try” -&gt; Say “will” or “won’t”</p>
<p>Don’t say “problem” -&gt; Say “challenge”</p>
<p>Don’t say “like” or “dislike” -&gt; Say “effective” or “ineffective”</p>
<p>Believe in what you’re doing, and keep doing it.</p>
<p>Four agreements to having a great life:</p>
<ol>
<li>Be impeccable with your word (always do what you say you’ll do)</li>
<li>Don’t make assumptions (always communicate)</li>
<li>Don’t take anything personally (“leave your ego at the door” – Stanislavsky)</li>
<li>Always do your best</li>
</ol>
<p>Obstacles make for interest.</p>
<p>Every product is only as good as those who made it.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today, one event in particular stuck out to me, showing me how close a group of my classmates have become.</p>
<p>I’m taking this rather unusual First Year Seminar called <em>Finding Your Muse</em>. (Check out my previous post for more details.) Each Monday, two students lead the entire class period. I co-led my “Monday Muse” session several weeks ago. In consultation with the professor, you plan out the class period considering where the ensemble is now, where they need to go, and how they can get there.</p>
<p>Today, the theme was Vulnerability. The two students leading the session had us each prepare a story to share about a meaningful experience that has affected our life in a profound way. What was so fantastic about this was that, going around the circle and telling our stories, everyone completely trusted each other. Some people shared stories that they never had before. Some people cried. Some people talked about hardships that they’re still struggling with today. I won’t share details, but let’s just say it was deeply moving.</p>
<p>We also had a discussion about each individual student, examining how others see them versus why and who they actually are.</p>
<p>After just an hour-long discussion, the feeling of unsurpassed safety was unanimous. We hugged, wiped our tears, and some parted ways while others continued bonding over lunch.</p>
<p>In the everyday hustle and bustle of college students’ lives, it’s easy to disregard the larger, sometimes painful truths that exist in our histories. It was such a remarkable blessing to have this experience today. It was so refreshing and enlightening to have everyone shed their defenses and just talk about big, complex things that have made them who they are.</p>
<p>We’re not just a class anymore. We’re becoming a family.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey everyone! My name is Emma and I’m a freshman double majoring in Theatre with a concentration in Directing, and Business with a concentration in Arts Administration. I have absolutely adored my Muhlenberg experience so far, and wouldn’t change it for the world. This semester I’m taking five classes:</p>
<p><strong>Principles of Microeconomics</strong>, taught by one of my favorite professors, Dr. Laposata, is the first Econ I’ve ever taken. We have a quiz every other class, which I really appreciate because it (hopefully) ensures that everyone stays on top of the material we’re covering.</p>
<p><strong>Principles of Fitness &amp; Wellness</strong><span style="color: #333333; font-style: normal; line-height: 24px;"> is a General Academic Requirement (GAR) that all students typically take during their freshman year. We’ve just completed the Wellness module of the course, which featured many guest speakers from areas of the college including IT, Res Life and the Career Center. Next up is the Fitness module, led by soccer Coach Topping.</span></p>
<p><strong>Voice and Speech for the Actor</strong> is probably both my favorite and most dreaded course I’ve yet to take at Berg. Through three-hour experiential workshops each week, we’ve so far explored the production of sound, tension and stress, phonetics and personal histories, all the while tackling my ironic fear of speaking in front of a group. The teacher, Troy Dwyer, is perhaps the most enlightened and motivating professor at Muhlenberg, and this class has allowed me more personal growth than I’d ever have anticipated.</p>
<p><strong>Design for the Theatre</strong> with Tim Averill is a requirement for my Directing concentration and I’m enjoying it very much. It’s definitely more of a discussion and experiential learning class than my other courses. We’ve recently been learning about different elements of visual and spatial design through our in-class analysis of the play <em>Peer Gynt</em> by Henrik Ibsen.</p>
<p><strong>Finding Your Muse</strong> with Dr. Michael London is my first year seminar (FYS), and is both a writing intensive and performance ensemble course. Through discussions, papers, in-class free writes, readings, artistic collaborations, etc., we are spending the semester exploring what it means to be creative and developing a cumulative large-scale performance piece. As part of the curriculum, two weeks ago I was challenged to lead an entire class period with one other classmate. It was an absolutely fantastic experience.</p>
