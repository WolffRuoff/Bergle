<p>Are you ready? Sitting down?</p>
<p>I am sorry to announce that this will be my last blog post of the year. Yes I know, so sad! Unfortunately the time has come to say goodbye. Junior year has come to an end and now itâ€™s time to start thinking about the summer festivities.</p>
<p>I am thrilled to announce that this summer I will be conducting Neuroscience research with a professor at Muhlenberg. Additionally, I was awarded the position of <em>Presidential Assistant for Religious Life</em> at Muhlenberg, where I will be responsible for programing and engagement for Hillel (the Jewish organization on campus). I am so excited to begin this position in June of this summer and continue through the end of the academic year (2016).</p>
<p>Thank you all for letting me share my experiences at Muhlenberg and abroad with all of you. To all of those prospective students out there, come find me next year! I would love to meet all of you and introduce you to my home away from home, Muhlenberg.</p>
<p>Always,</p>
<p>Ariel</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s a wrap folks! My freshman year of college is a offally in the rear view mirror. Some of you have been with me along the journey&#8230;reading about my fear of cold weather, to writing my first college essay, the long wrestling season and more.</p>
<p>What an incredible ride it&#8217;s been. The year was an endless collection of ups, downs, and invaluable experiences that I&#8217;ll cherish forever.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t help but be nostalgic looking back at the memories, both good and bad. No matter the pleasure or struggle, I can confidently say I learned so much about myself this year. I can look back and measurably see that I changed for the better in several ways. I think that&#8217;s indicative too of the type of environment that Muhlenberg has been in facilitating that personal growth.</p>
<p>Aside from the pictures, posts, and texts, that all serve as evidence, I have the unique privilege of being able to reflect on my past blogs as a reminder of where my head was at during different parts of the year. On one hand, rereading them brings me straight to the moment I wrote it, and it seems like an instant ago. But at the same time, many of those individual highs and lows seem ancient now. All in all, I&#8217;m so grateful to have had the chance to catalog my life this year and I hope you enjoyed experiencing it with me.</p>
<p>One down, three to go!</p>
<p>Until potentially next time, (depending on what admissions does with me, I may or may not blog about it in the fall. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="ðŸ˜‰" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
