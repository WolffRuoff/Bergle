<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/12/ryanhs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-613" title="Kevin Ryan" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/12/ryanhs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Kevin Ryan</strong></p>
<p><strong>Six is not a typical number for a defensive back; how did you end up wearing it?</strong><em> </em>I originally wore the number back in high school for both baseball and football, and when I arrived at Muhlenberg my freshman year, six was the number they gave me. I thought that was pretty cool, and six kind of just became a part of me. And now it’s my favorite number.</p>
<p><strong>What was it like punting last year? </strong>I had never punted before in my life. One practice, coach came up to me and told me I was going to start punting. I never thought I’d actually end up punting in a game, though. Don’t get me wrong, I had some stellar punts in my short-lived career, but I think it’s safe to say it was a failed experiment.<em></em></p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans? </strong>Make millions of dollars through penny stocks. Then buying a WNBA franchise and leading it to multiple championships. The Dalai Lama himself once told me that on my deathbed I would receive total consciousness. So I’ve got that going for me, which is nice.<em></em></p>
<p><strong>What kind of teammate is Gregg Mercogliano?</strong><em> </em>Gregg “The Leg” Mercogliano is the best teammate one could have. Secretly, he is the funniest kid on the team. Armed with feathered and lethal hair, “The Leg” is the backbone of Muhlenberg Special Forces. Cogs is a go-getter. Most people would back down from certain challenges, such as a 4th-and-19 fake punt, but not Cogs. With zero hesitation, he put his blazing speed to work running with such gracefulness the he reminded the crowd of a young Barry Sanders. He may have come up a couple yards shy, but nevertheless, Cogs is one man I’m grateful to have on my team.</p>

<p><strong>How rewarding does it feel to be making an impact in your final season? </strong>It’s been a great feeling to contribute to the team this year on game day. I stayed committed during the summer to make this season an important and memorable one. I’m glad it is paying off so far. Having a great snapper and holder helps as well.</p>
<p><strong>What was the feeling like when your 44-yard field goal sailed through the uprights at Gettysburg? </strong>It felt good. We spend a lot of time in practice working on situational field goals, and to make a long one in a game felt rewarding. Unfortunately, the outcome of the game didn’t turn out the way we wanted it to. <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans? </strong>I plan on working in the accounting field in either Philadelphia or New York. I also plan on hopefully passing the CPA exam. If I can’t get a job right away, I plan on trading stocks during the day.  </p>
<p><strong>What kind of player is Steve Nissley? </strong>Niss is a great teammate and one of my best friends. On the field, he’s known for his strong work ethic and physical toughness. Off the field, he’s known for his fashion style. He has a nice collection of Armani watches and always seems to be wearing a classic pair of penny loafers. I’m glad I became friends with Niss and know he will have a successful future.</p>

<p><strong>You’ve made the Centennial Conference Academic Honor Roll; how have you been able to balance your time between school and football? </strong>Finding time to study and finish work for class can be a struggle during the season. At times I’ve had to pass on going out with some friends to finish some work, but playing football and maintaining good grades have taught me how to manage my time well. Looking back on it, I have no idea how I managed playing football, classes and living in the crazy world of Benfer for two straight years.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What off-the-field accomplishment are you most proud of? </strong>I would say starting up and successfully running my business, “Fresh-Niss Barber Shop,” incorporated in 2008, providing Muhlenberg College with a one-of-a-kind look. I like to think of myself as Van Gogh with clippers in my hand, just dishing out masterpieces left and right. I can also cut with scissors, and have perfected “the visor” look specifically for my good friend Gregg “4G connecting from anywhere on the field” Mercogliano. Additionally, I’m looking for investors to help expand my business along the East Coast and eventually overseas.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans? </strong>I’m hoping to get out and travel a little after graduation before I start working in the fall at Deloitte. I’m leaning towards Las Vegas for its spontaneity.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s Kevin Ryan like off the field? </strong>A wise man once told me, “Never trust a man with two first names.” Kevin Ryan is definitely a character. Some of the things that go through his head could be classified under Area 51 — just straight up unexplainable. But when push comes to shove, I know he would have my back. Kev is a great friend, and it has been a pleasure playing ball with him over the past four years. We’ve had some good memories and many more to come.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/12/nadellhs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-616" title="Chase Nadell" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/12/nadellhs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Chase Nadell</strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s the biggest hit you’ve ever delivered?</strong> It would have to be against Gettysburg my junior year. I came in untouched off the edge and just crushed the helpless running back. This is a funny game because you never want to hit to cause serious injury, but you always want to hit to instill a little fear in your opponent’s mind for the next time he’s carrying or catching the ball. That was one of those hits that let Gettysburg know we were there. <em></em></p>
<p><strong>What’s the most memorable moment from your Mule career?</strong><em> </em>The first time I returned a kickoff against Union. I was so nervous and wondered how bad it was going to hurt when I got tackled. It turned out I would have to wait until the next return to see how it felt because I ended up taking that kick back 87 yards for a touchdown. It was my first touchdown and ended up being the game-winner.</p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans? </strong>I don’t know exactly what they are, but in the near future I plan to travel around Europe. It’s an experience that I always wanted to have. I feel that by traveling and seeing new things in different places, I’ll get a different perspective on living. I am thinking about going into wealth management for a career.<em></em></p>
<p><strong>What’s it been like playing both football and lacrosse with Andy Curley?</strong><em> </em>It has been more than amazing playing with Andy Curley. The man is one of my best friends. I am always trying to spend more time with him, but he’s always breaking our plans to go see the shows at the Center for the Arts; he just can’t get enough of the musicals. Seeing that Curley is in his fifth year here, a lot of the guys see him as a father figure and role model. He is never too busy to pass on his wisdom about the good old days and will never be afraid to teach you some pointers he’s picked up over his tenure here. It’s been a pleasure to have played with Andy, and I hope that he becomes a successful doctor so he can fix me after the season.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/curleyhs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-89" title="Andy Curley" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/curleyhs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Andy Curley</strong></p>
<p><strong>How great does it feel to be back on the field after being injured most of last season? What made you decide to come back for a fifth year? </strong>It feels great. Having to watch my teammates play my senior year was pretty tough to go through. This season definitely gives me a sense of closure on my career.<em> </em>I wanted to make sure Pat McDonough never got an interception, so I stepped in front of him to grab one at F&amp;M. Robbing him of that made it all worthwhile.<em></em></p>
<p><strong>What’s the most memorable moment from your Mule career? </strong>My freshman year we went 10-0 and then beat Salisbury during the first round of the playoffs. Since my cousin was the starting quarterback of that Salisbury team, it made our family Thanksgiving dinner the following week pretty enjoyable because I got to rub it in on him.</p>
<p><strong>You’ve been named to the Centennial Conference Academic Honor Roll six times; how have you been able to continually excel in the classroom while also playing two sports? </strong>I take it one day at a time, don’t sleep a lot and drink a lot of coffee.</p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans? </strong>I plan on attending medical school so I can become a doctor and fix other broken athletes that are aging way too fast like me. If that doesn’t work, I’ll probably just look into retirement and live with my parents for the rest of my life.<em></em></p>
<p><strong>What’s it been like playing both football and lacrosse with Chase Nadell?</strong><em> </em>Anybody that knows him agrees that I could write a collection of novels on Captain Chase and it still wouldn’t tell the whole story. He is unbelievably competitive, always energetic and a soft, caring person deep down inside. You could be having the worst day of your life, but you would forget about it by talking to Chase for five minutes. I can honestly say that I have never met anybody in my life like Chase, and I doubt I ever will. Chase is a person that everybody wants to be around, and I have been lucky to play with him here.</p>
