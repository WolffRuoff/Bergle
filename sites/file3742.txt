								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“Ricky Martin to be honored by GLAAD.” (9 February 2011). Associated Press. Billboard. Retrieved from <a href="http://www.billboard.com/#/news/ricky-martin-to-be-honored-by-glaad-1005026962.story">http://www.billboard.com/#/news/ricky-martin-to-be-honored-by-glaad-1005026962.story</a></p>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://www.rumromanismrebellion.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/ricky_martin.jpg" alt="" width="168" height="167" />The <a href="http://www.glaad.org/">Gay and Lesbian Alliance against Defamation (GLAAD)</a> will honor Ricky Martin and actress/Broadway singer Kristin Chenoweth at their 22nd Annual Media Awards on March 19. The group promotes individuals from the media industry who promote LBGT individuals’ rights and contribute to their acceptance in the industry in general. The group specifically wants to honor Martin’s contribution to helping Latino LBGT individuals openly “come out,” as <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/ricky-martin-fortunate-homosexual-man/story?id=10234454">Martin himself did just last year</a>.</p>
<p><span id="more-782"></span></p>
<p>Some might question GLAAD’s decision to honor someone who waited so long to “come out.” Martin’s been around for over a decade, and he deferred questions about his sexuality for most of those years. However, the enormous personal and political risks of “coming out” in the media industry probably made Martin hesitate to talk openly about what everyone suspected. Overt discrimination was certainly possible, but the public derision and lampooning that awaits openly gay artists may have been the greater fear. And what would “coming out” do to Martin’s relationship with his label, especially back in the late nineties when he was an up-and-coming artist? When a new artist is up for promotion by a label, it’s sometimes advisable for him to keep potential controversies at bay, especially if the label is targeting a mainstream market.</p>
<p>In fact, Martin’s choice to “come out” now probably reflects his increased power as a creator in the music industry. He pulls his own weight with his label now and boasts a large and diverse fan base, and so feels sure enough that his sexuality will no longer adversely affect his career. It&#8217;s even possible that, with so many openly-gay or gay-supporting artists on the scene right now (read: Lady Gaga), &#8220;coming out&#8221; as  LBGT today can help to boost an artist&#8217;s career. However, that was not necessarily the case only a decade ago.</p>
<p>In many ways, GLAAD hopes to encourage the media industry to be more supportive of those LBGT up-and-coming artists, rather than forcing them into the closet until they become popular enough to “come out” safely. GLAAD’s public advocacy role here is clear: They are trying to increase representation in all media industries, including the sound recording industry, for LBGT artists. At its core, this is an <a href="http://www.ethnicmajority.com/media_home.htm">age-old demand for more diverse views in American media</a>. GLAAD&#8217;s cause, however, may be gaining ground. The large fan base of artists like Martin, whose sexuality was never truly a secret, proves that sexuality matters less and less compared to talent. There are more openly LBGT individuals in the media industry today than ever before. And the recording industry now routinely uses these individuals to target niche markets. In Martin’s case, not only the LBGT community, but also specifically the <em>Latino</em> LBGT community may now be more receptive to his music.</p>
<p>Sex and identity politics have always been part of the business strategy of the record industry. Incorporating LBGT sexuality and identity into that strategy ultimately doesn’t take much imagination. That profit motive and pressures from groups like GLAAD may contribute to a new openness in the industry toward openly LBGT artists.</p>
