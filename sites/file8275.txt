								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Social media is a platform which allows the teens of today’s world to communicate with other people from all around the world and from all walks of life. In theory, social media is a positive mechanism that brings all people closer together. However, in reality, the complete opposite is true. As explained in the YouTube video “How social media is affecting teens,” the youth of today are being harmed by too much social media interaction. The ways in which they are being affected does not refer to one’s impaired eye sight from staring at a screen for too long or obesity from reduced activity. Rather, this destruction is attributed to the desire to be famous (The National, 2014).</p>
<p>Researcher Yalda Uhls conducted a few experiments on teenagers in Los Angeles and elementary school students in Canada (The National, 2014). The basis of the experiment was to get the kids to write down a personalized list of the top 16 lifetime goals and aspirations that they valued the most in order of importance (The National, 2014). When this experiment was conducted in the past the 15th goal, which can be assumed to be almost the least important, was typically fame. Uhls’ results were the complete opposite during the most recent version of the similar experiment; the majority of teens that were involved in this study had fame as their number one want in life (The National, 2014). According to Uhls, this sudden desire to be famous is closely linked to the increased use of social media today. This escalation in time spent being engaged with some nature of technology is not allowing teens to have time for reflection whether it be of oneself or another person. In turn, this causes these technology-driven teens to have less empathy for others which subsequently leads to a generation full of people who do not care about the well-being of others (The National, 2014). This statistic is just another aspect in which social media is damaging society.</p>
<p>Obviously teens are not spending 100% of their time on social media sites. Whenever their nose is not in the phone however, they are sometimes mesmerized by a program that is on television. These programs go hand in hand with social media and can be used to explain why today’s teens have such an overambitious want to be famous (The National, 2014). Some of the most popular television shows from the past decade deal with people being liked and becoming famous. For example, <em>Hannah Montana</em> was about a girl who was an average teenager by day and an iconic pop star by night and <em>American Idol</em> was about average people auditioning in front of judges and competing against other contestants to be recognized as a wonderful singer (The National, 2014). Although both of these shows no longer exist, they are certainly what today’s teens grew up watching which makes them relevant to the issue at hand.</p>
<p>In the long run, it can be argued that parents are the culprits to be blamed for this unrealistic infatuation that teens possess (Marshall, 2009). More and more often today you see children who can’t walk or talk yet but are toying with an iPad and navigating through the device better than most adults would be able to. Parents who shove technology in the faces of children just so they will stop bothering them are the ones who are kick starting the obsession with social media and therefore, the desire to be famous. If children were taught that being famous is not everything from the beginning then society would not be faced with a bunch of young teens who only care about how many likes their selfie got on Instagram.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is no secret that in today’s world people have an ever-growing hunger for the newest, the best, and the quickest form of any good/service that exists. This demand for efficiency has subsequently led to the invention of many products that fulfilled such requirements. For example, people did not want to wait three days for a letter to be delivered to its recipient so electronic mail (e-mail) was invented, some people did not want to wait in a ticket booth line on the Turnpike so E-ZPass transponders were manufactured, and students did not feel like manually having to write citations for papers so online citation websites were generated. All of the aforementioned inventions are different and unique in terms of what they provide but similar in their purpose: keeping up with consumers’ mile-a-minute lifestyles. Following suit is banking. The days of actually going to a bank, conversing face to face with a teller, and completing a transaction are soon to be long gone. In their place is electronic banking: the newest, the best, and the quickest way to deposit, withdrawal, or transfer funds. Chapter 7 of <em>The Future of Banking</em> focuses solely on electronic banking. The term “electronic banking” is an umbrella terms that covers any banking activity accessed by electronic means (2002, p 131). To further simplify this concept, note that it includes automated teller machines (ATMs), automated call centers, digital cash, Internet banking, and many other electronic-related forms of banking (2002, p 131).</p>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, electronic banking is not as innovative as it has been made out to be. The first form of electronic banking arose in 1871 when a nationwide money-transfer service was being offered by the Western Union Telegraph Company (2002, p 132). This was then followed by the Fedwire telegraph system in 1918, SWIFT and CHIPs payments systems in the 1970s, and Western Union’s first over-the-Internet services in 2000 (2002, p 132). In between all of these large milestones are more milestones that are smaller than but just as important as their predecessors. Such achievements include the first machine to read checks, credit cards, ATMs, and a multitude of other Internet-based inventions and innovations (2002, p 132). It is undeniable to say that society’s banking ways have made leaps and bounds since their birth 144 years ago. However, what is not so clear to people is if society is still headed in the right path or if it is time to take a break from becoming so obsessed with the need for speed in every aspect of daily life. Despite the extreme convenience of it, is electronic banking posing a number of negative effects on society?</p>
<p>It can be argued that technology is ruining society in a number of different ways. In this instance, electronic banking is affecting society negatively in three major ways. First, the amount of jobs available to people is steadily decreasing. It is predicted that 45% of all jobs will belong to robots within the next two decades (Worstall, 2013). Second, people are becoming dependent on technology. The 188 billion text messages sent monthly in the US alone is an enormous indicator that people have an electronic obsession (Kluger, 2010). Another red flag appears when people are installing devices that make their lives revolve around technology now more than ever (Kluger, 2010). The final reason that electronic banking has adverse effects is the lost amount of face-to-face interaction between people. The assumption of believing that closing banks is not significant because it is just “one job,” is beyond false due to the fact that there are a number of jobs that are similarly being eliminated which add up and become an enormous issue for society to deal with. Nowadays, on average, people only have 74 face-to-face conversations a month (Narins, 2013). Closing banks and other like-businesses will only cause this statistic to become even worse. Although Gup refers to electronic banking as “innovative,” “faster,” “better,” and “cheaper” it is safe to say that he is wrong (2002, p 133). With the continued support and advancement of electronic banking and other technology-based substitutes, society as a whole will be hurt more than they will be helped.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is no doubt that social media plays an enormous role in people’s, mainly teens, lives today. The innumerable amount of social media sites that exist allow today’s youth to feel a sense of connectedness and individuality. However, researchers are beginning to look at the shocking fact that although users are compelled in such a way, the complete opposite is occurring. More, now than ever, social media users are possessing less of a sense of individuality that they ever have before (Andsager, 2014). As if that is not scary enough, these users typically do not even realize that they are being influenced to act, look, or be a certain way. The underlying urges to be a clone of society’s ideal man/woman are causing impressionable teens to fall victim to body dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>In the 1980’s anorexia nervosa and other similar eating disorders became recognized health issues for young girls (Andsager, 2014). More than 30 years later, such eating disorders have become massive health problems for society. Not only has the magnitude of the disorders changed but so have their victims; now it is not unusual for males to be battling the same disorders as females (Andsager, 2014). The article states that factors such as sexual orientation and gender roles need to be taken into consideration when searching for the cause of the eating disorder but at the root of it all is the unnatural and unbearable amounts of social pressure that today’s youth are faced with daily, especially on social media sites (Andsager, 2014). Although males are battling eating disorders and body dissatisfaction just as much as females, in terms of such disorders stemming from social media, females are more abundant. This is due to the fact that there is a generally higher percentage of females that use social media sites (Andsager, 2014).</p>
<p>A quote from the article that truly illustrates the level to which society has sunk and may explain why teens, mostly females, have disorders and dissatisfaction is “[It] has not been physically possible for the idealized U.S. female body to become much thinner in the last 20 years…” (Andsager, 2014). Social media reinforces the need to be as thin as possible because of the ease of access to communities of people that share this belief. Before any form of social media existed, eating disorders and body dissatisfaction were not a well-known issue because teens could not as easily seek out positive reinforcement in their quest for thinness. In today’s world when anything a person wants to find out is one quick Google search away, eating disorders and body dissatisfaction is through the roof. The existence of “Thinspiration” boards on Pinterest and @Perfect_Women profiles on Instagram and Twitter are huge perpetrators. All of the different versions of social pressures on those three popular social media sites were found in one simple search and were accompanied by a multitude of others just like it. Therefore, young females need to recognize the adverse effects of social media and keep them in mind when on such sites. By doing so, users would be less manipulated into believing that they need to look like someone else and accept and love who they are.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the ever evolving world today, teens have become so accustomed to the presence and use of technology in their day to day lives. With the existence of technology, comes the ever-growing want and need of two top priorities: to be connected to friends, family, and strangers around the world and to have one’s privacy remain intact while doing so. In July 2011, the wants and needs of the aforementioned teens came true via the release of Snapchat. The app was created by Evan Spiegel, Bobby Murphy, and Reggie Brown as a requirement for a course at Stanford University (“Snapchat,” 2015).  The app’s platform encourages users to send candid pictures of whatever it is that they are doing in that moment. The unsaved photos are then sent to user’s friends and are deleted after a maximum of ten seconds which is set by the sender. Although this form of social media sounds utopic, are teens relying so heavily on the assumption that the pictures are deleted forever that they let their guard down? The answer is yes.</p>
<p>An increased sense of privacy is typically accompanied by an increased sense of indestructibility. Within the four years that Snapchat has been up and running, sexting has become overwhelmingly popular because users believe that once the content disappears after the time limit expires, it is gone forever (“Snapchat,” 2015). Contrary to popular belief, Snapchat’s main privacy page states that “there may be ways to access messages while still in temporary storage on recipients’ devices or, forensically, even after they are deleted (“Privacy Policy,” 2014).” Therefore, users of Snapchat are being deceived by themselves. By not knowing the full parameters of the app, one is acting in ways that they would not if they did not believe the app was private. The fact that this not-really-private-privacy is not hidden but rather in regular sized text on the main webpage of Snapchat, shows that teens are not looking carefully at what they are agreeing to when signing up for an account. Consequently, I believe that teens today allow themselves to get into the trouble that they are getting in because they are too quick to believe what they want to be true.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Instagram is one of the most popular forms of social media that exists. The platform of this specific social media focuses solely on the posting of pictures with different filters and captions which are seen by a user’s followers who are able to like and comment on the posted photo. Although Instagram has a lot of positive aspects such as allowing people to be connected to family, friends, and strangers around the world, there are still numerous adverse effects that make the app not as advantageous as it is intended to be. In the article “The Instagram Effect: How the Psychology of Envy Drives Consumerism,” author, Lane Anderson lays out on the table all of the destructive consequences that stem from the thriving site. Anderson categorizes the most prominent aspects as “peer pressure,” “reality check,” and most importantly, “comparison.” Comparison is by far the most emphasized point in this article. Anderson interviewed multiple people and quoted them throughout the article and without fail, each person mentioned something about the envy that is typically instilled in majority of Instagram’s users.</p>
<p>A quote that embodies the overall message of this article was said by Andrea Mouritsen, a well-known blogger turned Instagrammer. In regards to “famous” bloggers receiving free gifts just because they are well-known on the Internet, Mouritsen said, “There are photos of (a popular blogger) pushing a $1,800 stroller while a professional photographer follows them. Suddenly, I feel like my stroller is a piece of crap, and it puts me in a state of annoyance.” This quote is so vital to relaying the author’s message because it shows how Instagram is being misused. Instagram is supposed to make the users feel unified with the people that they follow; whether people are following their friends, family, or a superstar, everyone is on the same level. However, when situations like the one above occur users are no longer on the same level. Instead, people are driven apart and it is often a person’s own fault for allowing this to happen.</p>
<p>This is not to say that comparison is always an awful thing. Sometimes it can be a constructive component that people utilize in order to better him- or herself or life. Comparison changes sides when people allow it to morph into envy and allow it to affect their life.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At one point in the article “Want to Be a Better Writer? Read More.” author Mike Hanski claims that every writer’s purpose for writing are the people that will eventually read the work. Hanski’s statement is proven to be true throughout the entire article with his choice of diction which acts as the driving force behind relaying the aforementioned message. With his strategic word choice, Hanski is able to subtly persuade his audience to believe that reading is an essential component in the journey to becoming a successful writer by keeping his audience in mind while writing.</p>
<p>In the first full paragraph, Hanski refers to reading in a positive, upbeat manner to make it seem inviting and fun. A few words that immediately stand out are “fashionable”, “cool”, “awesome”, and “wonderful.” Although these adjectives are not all referring to reading directly, they all have a helpful impact indirectly. Hanski uses such words because he hopes that they will cause his audience to think about all of the positive effects of and thoughts about reading and writing rather than negative ones. Due to the pleasant thoughts that come to the minds of the audience, Hanski’s persuasion becomes effective.</p>
<p>Contrary to initial thought, Hanski does not only focus on the positive effects of reading; he also spends some time reviewing the negative results of not reading. Abandoning his use of positive vocabulary seen in the beginning of the article, Hanski switches to a darker choice of words. He brings up “social exclusion”, “illiteracy”, and “unemployment” which are all undesirable situations to be in. By bringing up such circumstances, he assumes that the reader will realize how serious it is if a person has poor reading habits/abilities because no reader will read this section and think that he or she wants to be in any of the mentioned categories.</p>
<p>In the grand scheme of things, Hanski’s main goal is not to only display the fact that positive words lead to positive thoughts and vice versa; rather, Hanski wants the words in his article to work in a way that will leave a lasting impression on the reader. Because of this objective Hanski does not use trite words such as “good” or “bad” which do not have the same effects that the wisely selected ones have on its’ readers. Nonetheless, it is quite clear that Hanski followed his own advice and wrote his article while keeping his target audience in mind. Throughout the entirety of the article Hanski shed light on all of the positive aspects of reading even though sometimes his description came off as something negative. Due to his very carefully chosen words, Hanski produced an article that truly persuades the readers that reading is a paramount mechanism in order to become a triumphant writer.</p>
