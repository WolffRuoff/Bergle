								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bond, Paul. (2011, April 27). &#8216;Atlas Shrugged&#8217; producer promises two sequels despite terrible reviews, poor box office. <em>The Hollywood Reporter</em>. Retrieved from <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/atlas-shrugged-producer-promises-two-182714">http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/atlas-shrugged-producer-promises-two-182714</a></p>

The film, based on Ayn Rand&#8217;s long controversial 1957 novel of the same name, opened on April 15. This is probably news to many of this blog&#8217;s readers, and it&#8217;s news to us as well. In writing the novel &#8220;Atlas Shrugged,&#8221; Rand incorporated her philosophical viewpoints into a highly debated novel that has been drawing negative criticism but a devoted fanbase for decades. Rand, a philosopher and author, was known for developing the philosophical system of Objectivism, which advocated reason as the only method of gaining knowledge and emphasized laissez-faire (or hands-off) capitalism in politics. This should sound familiar, as the recent rapid rise of the Tea Party in American politics gave John Aglialoro, a producer/financier, the idea to finally bring a film version of the &#8220;unfilmable&#8221; &#8220;Atlas Shrugged&#8221; to the big screen. However, the film received an atrocious 9% score on Rotten Tomatoes (which measures critics&#8217; reviews), with only 3 positive reviews out of 35 overall. And with middling box office returns added to the public perception of the film, Aglialoro has spoken out against film critics for their hatred of &#8220;individualism&#8221; and stated his plans to make two follow-up films.<span id="more-1164"></span></p>
<p>Unlike most feature films produced through the Hollywood system, Aglialoro spent $10 million of his money to finance the film through an independent studio. &#8220;Atlas Shrugged: Part 1&#8221; also avoided conventional marketing norms and instead concentrated on the Internet and talk radio to get word out about the film and attract a niche audience of those who share Rand&#8217;s political views. Specifically, Aglialoro was hoping to attract Libertarians and Tea Party followers, an effort that seems to have at least partially worked. Despite the critical drubbing and poor box office, Rotten Tomatoes also indicates that 85% of the audience who voted on their website actually recommends the film. However, the film is becoming well-known for some of the harsh reviews it has received. Peter Travers of <em>Rolling Stone</em> gave the movie zero stars and said &#8220;the novel gets the l0w-budget, no-talent treatment and sits there flapping on screen like a bludgeoned seal,&#8221; while Vadim Rizov of <em>Boxoffice Magazine </em>called the film &#8220;lifeless as entertainment and incoherent as ideology.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aglialoro has accused professional film critics of having a political agenda while speaking out about the film. &#8220;It was a nihilistic craze. Not in the history of Hollywood has 16 reviewers said the same low things about a movie. They&#8217;re lemmings. What&#8217;s their fear of Ayn Rand? They hate this woman. They hate individualism,&#8221; he said in this <em>Hollywood Reporter </em>article. Aglialoro also indicated his desire to continue making adaptations of &#8220;Atlas Shrugged,&#8221; both because particular audiences have responded well to it and as a means of spiting the critics. He also acknowledged that future films should most likely have different marketing strategies to expose them to a wider audience, perhaps by partnering with a major studio or spending more money to advertise the films on television and open them on more theaters.</p>
<p>The limited success of &#8220;Atlas Shrugged: Part 1&#8221; with a narrow audience and the completely negative reaction to it from nearly everyone else shows many things about success in the film industry. To attract a broad audience and win the approval of film critics, filmmakers cannot simply rely on a cult audience to bring in profits. While many films in the past saw box office success despite critics&#8217; negative opinions, the reviews on &#8220;Atlas Shrugged: Part 1&#8221; were <em>so </em>bad that it likely deterred many from seeing the film. The lack of traditional marketing also likely contributed to the film&#8217;s failure. Aglialoro concentrated largely on getting fans of the book and Rand&#8217;s followers to come out to see the film, but the focus on this group was so specific that it alienated everyone else. The Internet can be an effective marketing enhancer when a film is already being promoted through print and other forms of mass media; however, it cannot be the sole marketing technique. &#8220;Atlas Shrugged: Part 1,&#8221; true to its title, was met with indifference from the general audience, and it remains to be seen whether Aglialoro&#8217;s hopes for parts 2 and 3 will be met with a similar response or worse&#8230;</p>
