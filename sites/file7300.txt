					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;This was really relatable to me because sometimes when I am bored I will play games on the computer. Video games are definitely not allowed to be blamed for wasting time because People choose to play in their free time. I do agree with you that binge playing is dangerous but in moderation computer games are okay and perfectly fine for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;This is a really interesting take on perceptions of technology and video games in specific. Although we are exposed to video games, we cannot blame them for taking up our time. When we play, we consciously make the decisions to use our time to play the game rather than doing something else. The video games are there for us to use. However, what we do with them and how long we use them is completely up to us and we cant put the blame on anyone or anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
