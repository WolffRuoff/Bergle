								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-230" src="http://mediacom.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2009/11/main_hdr-300x66.jpg" alt="main_hdr" width="300" height="66" srcset="http://mediacom.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2009/11/main_hdr-300x66.jpg 300w, http://mediacom.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2009/11/main_hdr.jpg 984w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Starting last December, I began working on my resume with a family friend who works at CNN in New York City. Especially in the field of Media and Communication, the importance of connections is priceless. You’ll be surprised how far a few friendly emails can take you; that contact can be a genuine help in getting your name out there! She personally placed my resume on the desks of some of CNN’s top producers, which lead to interviews and my ultimate offer for a position as an intern with <em>Showbiz Tonight</em>, an entertainment news show that airs on CNN’s sister network, HLN.</p>
<p>The first day I set foot in the Time Warner building, I was naturally nervous. But the more days I worked, the more comfortable I became with the friendly staff and the intern jobs, which included printing scripts for the show’s anchor, greeting and briefing show guests, finding footage for the Production Assistants, logging and assisting with interviews, and helping the writers with research. Each day, I attended the morning meeting in which Dave Levine, Senior Executive Producer and head of CNN Entertainment, lead the staff in planning the day’s show, and I was encouraged to participate. Watching a show come together from scratch was amazing.</p>
<p>A few weeks into my internship, what began as a relatively normal day turned into an experience that I will never forget. When both Farrah Fawcett and Michael Jackson passed away on June 25, <em>Showbiz</em> aired live at 11 pm to keep up with the coverage. Although the other intern and I were told we didn’t need to stay, I had no intentions on leaving. I couldn’t help but stop to look around every once in a while and realize that I was here, at CNN, the day MJ died. And I helped report on it!</p>
<p>I also shadowed staff members in multiple departments, including the woman who helped me with my resume, in order to learn about each step of creating the show. When an employer encourages you to ask questions or ask to work with particular people whose jobs you are interested in, always go for it! In doing so, I not only got to know the staff members better and learn more specifics about writing, editing, and producing, but I was able to do more work myself. By the end of my internship, I had teleprompted for the show multiple times, edited my own voice-over video clips, gone to workshops with big CNN names like Soledad O’Brien and one of the head writers for <em>Anderson Cooper: 360</em>, and, finally, got to wave to an international audience during the taping of my last show.</p>
<p>Working towards a career in journalism, this internship was valuable in that it taught me a different type of journalism than I had ever worked in before, not to mention introduced me to some amazing people! I even returned to <em>Showbiz</em> this semester to do an interview assignment for one of my writing courses; after encouragement by all the staff members to keep in touch, I asked Dave Levine if he would be willing to do an interview and, despite his busy schedule, he agreed. It felt incredible to be sitting in the office of the head of CNN Entertainment, asking him questions about a picture of him with a pigtailed Britney Spears on the wall. From the day MJ passed away to the day I interviewed Dave Levine, this internship has helped to show me that I really am on the right track in my aspiring career path.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Lisa Siciliano &#8217;10 blogs about her summer internship.</em></p>
<p><em></em><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-143" src="http://mediacom.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2009/10/mtv_logo_by_h4v0c.jpg" alt="mtv_logo_by_h4v0c" width="180" height="180" srcset="http://mediacom.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2009/10/mtv_logo_by_h4v0c.jpg 300w, http://mediacom.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2009/10/mtv_logo_by_h4v0c-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 180px) 100vw, 180px" />How did I get an internship at MTV Networks?  I’m not 100% sure, but I would credit it to a strong resume and skill set as well as good luck and good timing.  Along with getting all A’s, choreographing a dance, and trying to live the college life, obtaining a summer internship was one of my greatest goals of the Spring 2008 semester.  After researching programs during my winter break, shadowing a Muhlenberg Alum at NBC, and fine tuning my resume and cover letter with help from The Career Center, I applied to MTV, ABC, and NBC.  I started receiving e-mails from MTV&#8217;s Human Resources Department and had various phone interviews with my future boss. By the end of finals, I was officially an MTV Networks Intern.  I worked for the Digital Encoding Services, and though I had no idea what I was in for, I was excited.</p>
<p>Digital Encoding Services is located on the tenth floor of MTV Networks, right in the middle of Times Square.  Its main objective is to prepare files to be sent to various “Download to Own” clients such as I-Tunes, X-Box, Amazon.com, Hulu, and more.  The episodes you watch of your favorite MTV shows on I-Tunes are put together by us!  DES also works with On-Demand programming for a variety of networks.  MTV Networks is not just MTV, but Spike, Comedy Central, Nickelodeon, Noggin, The N, VH1, MTV 2, and more.  One of the newer projects I worked on was preparing for the premiere of the new EPIX on demand movie channel for August.</p>
<p>My day to day duties included a variety of somewhat challenging projects.  I put my editing skills to use and edited files with Final Cut Pro—taking out the black commercial slugs.  I learned how to transcode, or crop files for certain specifications.  I encoded a variety of files, putting them on the computer from the tape to make sendable files.  I watched hours of television shows from “Dora the Explorer” to “Trucks” to “My Super Sweet Sixteen,” looking for any video or audio errors that would interrupt the file quality.  I even was a test audience member for the new show, “It’s On With Alexa Chung!”  I learned something new every day.</p>
<p>My internship at MTV Networks allowed me to put the theories and skills I have learned in Muhlenberg classes to use and it opened my eyes to how different the corporate world is from the classroom.  This internship reaffirmed that television production is something that I definitely want to pursue for at least part of my adult life.  Thankfully, I know that I can take the great experiences and the same determination and persistence that I used to get the internship to allow me to be successful in my life after Muhlenberg.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-104" src="http://mediacom.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2009/09/Untitled-11.jpg" alt="Untitled-1" width="127" height="96" /><em>Dr. Ranieri reflects on significance of internships.</em></p>
<p><em></em>Being a dog lover, I’m fond of the slogan that advises people to stay on the porch if you can’t run with the big dogs. The slogan suggests that if you’re not strong enough, you can’t compete. Our summer interns’ essays entitled <em>How did courses you took prepare you for your internship?</em> offered proof that they are strong contenders.<em> </em> For example, Jill Press learned while studying abroad “to become more independent” . . . a quality “that cannot be taught.” Interning at <a href="http://www.wdhafm.com/">WDHA 105.5</a> FM, Rebecca Shaffer found that <em>Media, Theory &amp; Methods</em> helped her “connect the politics to media.” The “coding skills” Nicole DiStefano learned in the same course were valuable to her as an intern at <a href="http://www.cosmopolitan.com/">Cosmopolitan Magazine</a>. <em>Media &amp; Society</em> groomed Christina Cangelosi to use “the same techniques as I did for the celebrity tracking essays” to create numerous photo galleries as an intern at <a href="http://www.b104.com/main.html">B104</a>.</p>
<p>Organizational and time management skills promoted in the classroom have a high value in the workplace. Jana Elfenbein learned in <em>Popular Culture &amp; Communication</em> to use note cards as an organizational tool which, she said, “helped me during my Weekly Edit meetings with the Health Department” of <a href="http://www.ivillage.com">iVillage</a>. Lisa Siciliano wrote that <em>Studio TV Workshop</em> “prepared her “for the demanding amount of work and fast pace” at her <a href="http://www.mtv.com">MTV</a> internship.</p>
<p><em>New Information Technologies</em> helped Kurt Beyer understand how social media is important for “the spread of information and exposure for talent” in his internship at <a href="http://www.icmtalent.com">International Creative Management</a>.  That course also helped digital native and <a href="http://today.msnbc.msn.com/">NBC Today Show</a> intern Meredith Murphy support “producers who were digital residents.”  Sarah Mellick learned in <em>Hypermedia</em> “how to manipulate photographic images” in Photoshop which was immensely valuable while interning at <a href="http://www.lyonsmaguns.com">Lyons Magnus</a>.</p>
<p>Courses like <em>Documentary Research</em> prepared Jillian Bevacqua by helping her “to understand the creation of a TV show.” Kimberly Kaufman wrote “many of the legal guidelines I had for <em>Documentary Research</em> were the same for <a href="http://www.hybridfilms.tv">Hybrid Films</a>.” Meredith Murphy also found that <em>Documentary Research </em>“was as close to what a producer would do for a television show as a student in a classroom setting.”</p>
<p>Reflecting on her internships at <a href="http://www.nbcnewyork.com/">NBC4 New York Sports</a> and <a href="http://www.ny1.com">NY Channel 1 Sports</a>, Alyssa Scaglione wrote that <em>Sports, Culture &amp; Media</em> “helped me not only sharpen my debating and reasoning skills but also let me form and express opinions about events actually taking place in the sports world.”  The <em>Public Relations</em> course came alive for Catherine Schwartz when she saw “publicists being ‘friendly adversaries’&#8221; at <a href="http://www.pmkhbh.com/">PMK/HBM Public Relations</a>, and for Lanna Solinsky who realized interning at <a href="http://www.tractenbergandco.com/">Tractenberg &amp; Co</a>. how “a unique pitch is critical.”</p>
<p>Whether in the classroom, working on course projects or studying abroad, it’s obvious that our interns get it. They transition easily from theories and skills learned in the classroom to successful work in their internships. Clearly, this summer’s interns can run with the big dogs.</p>
