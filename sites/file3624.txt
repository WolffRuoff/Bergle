<p>As busy college students, many of us find it difficult to sit down to watch our favorite shows when they originally air. That’s what makes a website like <a href="http://www.hulu.com/">Hulu</a> so convenient—this online television option makes it easy to catch up on <em>Glee</em> or <em>The Office</em> in between classes (or parties).  Also attractive to college students is the fact that Hulu is free, as the site earns its money from advertisers rather than from users.  While Hulu is fantastic for busy TV fans, it is not necessarily ideal for television networks—while the networks are given a share of Hulu’s advertising revenue, some have deemed this percentage inadequate (check out this <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/03/business/media/03hulu.html?scp=1&amp;sq=hulu%20and%20comedy%20central&amp;st=Search"><em>New York Times</em> article</a>, which describes Comedy Central’s grievances with and temporary departure from Hulu).   Adding to the industry’s woes is the difficulty of measuring ratings from Hulu, which is also tied to profits, as networks use ratings as a resource to lure advertisers.  This dilemma was the topic of this &#8220;State of the TV Industry&#8221; panel at the February 15th TV Summit, an event hosted by the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences Foundation and <em>Variety</em>.</p>
<p><span id="more-892"></span></p>
<p>Television distribution has become extremely fragmented, providing audiences with a choice of where and how to watch TV shows.  Much like Tivo, a site like Hulu acts as a distributor that, in many ways, empowers audiences:  viewers aren’t bound to network-determined schedules and can watch their favorite shows when they want, free of charge.  The television industry’s effort to monetize this online content, a goal expressed by several members of the “State of the TV Industry” panel, creates a bit of a power struggle between audience and producer, with the distributor, Hulu, in the position of middleman with the ability to direct the flow of power.   However, the networks have some muscle when dealing with Hulu as they control a resource that is absolutely crucial to Hulu’s operation: content.  If a network is not satisfied with Hulu’s method of compensation, the network can simply withdraw its content from the site, which could cost Hulu viewers, and, as a result, money from advertisers.  Taking this power structure into consideration, we anticipate that Hulu will eventually shift into a completely subscription-based system (the site did recently add a premium option, <a href="http://www.hulu.com/plus">Hulu Plus</a>, which cost users $7.99 a month) in order to boost the percentage of its profits that it directs to the participating networks, which will ensure that these networks continue to provide Hulu with the content the site needs to hold onto audiences.</p>
<p>While much of the TV Summit discussion centered on the necessity of making a profit from online content, some panelists were more concerned with the quality of the content itself, with some industry insiders emphasizing the importance of inspired writers and emotionally-gripping story lines.  But when it comes to the issue of monetizing online television, it will be producers and investors, rather than TV writers or creators, who will exercise the most influence over this technological and financial issue.  However, if the networks’ monetization dreams do come true, audiences will, hopefully, demand top-notch quality if we’re asked to pay top-dollar to watch TV online.</p>
