<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are we beginning to count on the Internet for everything?  Not only are we beginning to rely on our music playlists created on online streaming cloud-based sites, but the founders of Skype are betting on our usual creation of playlists created in iTunes, are moving to &#8216;<a href="http://www.indystar.com/article/20110403/BUSINESS06/304030004/1281/BUSINESS06">celestial jukeboxes</a>&#8216; listened to through the Internet.  These internet radio stations, and cloud-based playlist options, are becoming new distributors for artists&#8217; music.  We aren&#8217;t completely forgetting about terrestrial radio in cars, and on systems in the house, but when people are choosing to listen to these internet streams they immediately think, well&#8230; can I play this in my car? Around the house?  In the bathroom?  And with the emergence of new technologies that support the access of these internet &#8220;user-created&#8221; stations and playlists, industries of many different types want to get their feet in the door.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span id="more-1043"></span></p>
<p>Linking with the music industry, radio is now becoming an on-demand service.  Listeners are able to pick their music, and if they have the technologies acquired for listening to their music, they will be more than willing to do so.  The automobile industry, smartphone industry, and the television industry are all becoming exhibitors and distributors for this idea of the &#8221; &#8216;celestial jukebox&#8217; of the Internet, allowing listeners to play virtually any song, any time, anywhere, through a variety of Internet-linked devices.&#8221;  Not only do we see the Internet becoming a huge producer and distributor for the internet radio, its facilitation is allowing for extreme variety when it comes to listening to music.</p>
<p>This is extremely threatening to FM/AM radio.  Those who will have access to these streaming sites will begin to acknowledge the fact that they are willing to pay a subscription fee/month to be able to listen to any music of their choice.  Instead of turning on the radio, hearing the same 20 songs played by the hour, and listening to boring, ever-lasting advertisements, they can subscribe to the internet radio sites, create their own playlists, and enjoy the music that they want to hear.  Some of these cloud-based sites aren&#8217;t subscription based yet, so they still need the support of the advertising power role, but in time they will build up to being subscription based.</p>
<p>&#8220;<a href="http://mog.com/">Mog</a> and <a href="http://www.rdio.com/">Rdio</a> offer subscribers unlimited access for a set monthly fee &#8212; $9.99 for both companies. For that amount, subscribers can select any song from a catalog of 8 million to 10 million tunes and listen through any device connected to the Internet.&#8221;  These are other Internet radio sites like Pandora and Slacker radio, and are giving people the chance of unlimited access for a small fee.  These sites can be accessed in the car, on a smartphone, and even on the television. &#8221; For times they lack an Internet connection, subscribers can store songs to a phone or laptop, music they can use as long as they subscribe.&#8221;  This is an extremely important feature because I&#8217;m sure the client-based roles were concerned with this aspect.  Not only could this bump out iTunes as a music distributor and exhibitor, but it can also knock out mp3&#8217;s and CD&#8217;s.  All in all, the internet is beginning to control not only social life, but how we now listen to music, and understand radio.  We don&#8217;t envision radio as talkshows, or advertisements anymore, because we have the ability to create the music played for us on &#8220;our&#8221; own, creator made radio stations.</p>

(22 February 2011). Interscope&#8217;s Jimmy Iovine fighting the 24-bit fight. <em>Billboard</em>. Retrieved from <a href="http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/industry/digital-and-mobile/interscope-s-jimmy-iovine-fighting-the-24-1005044072.story#">http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/industry/digital-and-mobile/interscope-s-jimmy-iovine-fighting-the-24-1005044072.story#</a></p>
<p>Forget CDs! The real format war in the recording industry is between 16-bit and 24-bit audio files, and some industry executives are taking the 24-bit side. Interscope CEO Jimmy Iovine and Columbia Records Co-President Rick Rubin are pressuring other labels to start releasing audio files to iTunes in the higher-quality 24-bit format, ostensibly in an effort to improve the user’s experience. Unfortunately for users, the price of the new format may increase along with the quality.</p>
<p><span id="more-921"></span></p>
<p>But which users will buy these new 24-bit files? In a world where CDs still form the bulk of the industry’s profits, it seems silly for industry executives to promote an upgrade from an iTunes file format that nobody’s complaining about. However, it’s not the first format upgrade the industry’s initiated. In fact, the industry aggressively promoted CDs back in the late eighties and ended up with a years-long boom in profits as everyone switched to the new format. Maybe industry executives are hoping to mirror their success with CDs by promoting another “higher-quality” format for which they can charge more.</p>
<p>The future of this plan, however, hinges on Iovine and Rubin’s success in recruiting other industry executives to their side. As producers, both executives worry about their companies’ future profitability, and history shows that every media company promoting its own personal format isn’t conducive to higher profits for anyone. Both surely remember the <a href="http://www.mediacollege.com/video/format/compare/betamax-vhs.html">disastrous VHS-Beta war of the eighties</a>. The industry’s continued existence may rely on multiple producers banding together under one format.</p>
<p>It’s also possible that, after alienating the bulk of their digital fan base with <a href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2008/09/proving-file-sh/">frivolous file-sharing lawsuits</a>, record industry executives like Iovine and Rubin are eager to prove that they’re still on the users’ side. What better way to do this than to don the public advocate hat and pretend that what’s good for the record industry is what’s good for America? After all, the higher-quality music may enrich users’ overall experience—and would probably sound <em>great</em> under some of Iovine’s <a href="http://www.beatsbydre.com/">“Beats by Dre” line headphones</a>!</p>
<p>The real linchpin in this scheme is, of course, <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/">Apple</a>. Industry executives can release music in any format they want, but Apple’s software and devices need to play them. As music distribution and exhibition responsibilities pass from “one-stops” to iTunes, Apple’s cooperation becomes a crucial component of any business strategy in the music industry. Iovine is working with Apple and says they’ve been “great,” which must be the new euphemism for “greedy.” Everyone who understands Apple knows they won’t agree to reconfigure their software and devices to run a new, higher-priced format without reconfiguring the way they manage profits from sales of that new, higher-priced music. Financial details are sketchy, but with industry executives and Apple executives (is there a difference anymore?) on either end of the bargaining table, the negotiations should be intense.</p>
<p>The real issue, however, revolves around whether music fans care more about quality of music or convenience of access. Another executive at Sony pointed out that users historically care more about convenience. And as every Internet user knows, accessing music online has never been more convenient. If a new 24-bit format became standard right now, it’s likely that the only major change would be more 24-bit files on <a href="http://thepiratebay.org/">Pirate Bay</a>.</p>
<p>Maybe industry executives should focus on getting people to pay for the existing 16-bit format before promoting new digital formats.</p>
