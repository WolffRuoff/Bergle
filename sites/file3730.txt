<div><span id="more-793"></span></div>
<div>These ideals create reason for Pandora to being to seek revenue for their site.   It is a unique site, therefore a &#8220;Wall Street&#8221; investment with an IPO (Initial Public Offering) to give Pandora capital to expand their intentions of keeping this site active for unique creativity of their users and potential users.  “Pandora is the leader in internet radio in the United States, offering a personalized experience for each of our listeners. We have pioneered a new form of radio – one that uses intrinsic qualities of music to initially create stations and then adapts playlists in real-time based on the individual feedback of each listener.&#8221;  This was quoted in the article by the Pandora company to give reasons as to why this hundred million dollar investment will be worth while and show great prospect in the future. Again, Pandora hopes to provide itself with more capital for expansion without incurring any debt. The risk is that the stock may lose value should investors lose faith in the company&#8217;s ability to make money, however because the company sees that Wall Street is being &#8220;receptive&#8221; to IPO&#8217;s in 2011, they have faith in this investment for the betterment of their company.</div>
