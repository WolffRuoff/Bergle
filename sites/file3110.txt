<p style="font-family: Times"><span style="font-family: Helvetica;font-size: 14px"><strong>Reflections on Alumni Week</strong> by Andalisa Lopez &#8217;12</span></p>
<p style="font-family: Times"><img style="float: right" src="http://mediacom.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/AndalisaLopez.jpg" border="0" alt="AndalisaLopez" width="250" height="416" /></p>
<p style="font-family: Times"><span style="font-size: 14px;font-family: Helvetica">For Media Communication majors, Alumni Week is a great opportunity to network with recent graduates who are living proof that jobs are out there.  I recently had the opportunity to speak with two recent graduates, Jillian Bevacqua ’11 and Jennifer Gable ’10 about their careers in the non-profit sector.  It was certainly refreshing to hear about alums who are continuing the Media Communication’s mission of social justice in their careers, and they both graciously agreed to share advice and the possibilities beyond the red doors.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: Times"><span style="font-family: Helvetica;font-size: 14px">Jillian Bevacqua was interested in writing and was not anticipating working at a non-profit but through connections at Muhlenberg College and taking advantage of networking, she landed a job as the External Affairs Associate at the Institute for Children, Poverty, and Homelessness in New York City.  The Institute is a research and policy organization that not only presents nationwide data on homelessness, but through its sister organization, Homes for the Homeless, provides firsthand assistance and shelter for homeless families in New York City.  Jillian’s work includes presenting data and policies to the public in a coherent and interesting way and plans conference attendance to help distribute publications to a wider audience.  Jillian also works with advertisers and designs ads which help to showcase the Institute’s work.  While the Institute for Children, Poverty, and Homelessness focuses more on policy, they do coordinate with more hands-on organizations such as Homes for the Homeless to strengthen programming.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: Times"><span style="font-family: Helvetica;font-size: 14px">Jennifer Gable knew she wanted to work for non-profits, and after a year as an AmeriCorps VISTA with the Community Action Committee of the Lehigh Valley, she is located in Washington, DC at the National Skills Coalition.  The National Skills Coalition works to fill the skills gap by organizing broad-based coalitions nationwide with the common goal of raising the skills of America’s workers across a range of industries.  They work with groups of business leaders, employers, and community organizations who can identify what skills are needed in the workforce, and advocate for policy changes that will help meet those needs and get America’s workers back on the job.  Her work as the Communications Associate includes advocacy, website management, social media, event planning, helping with press releases, media placements and media tracking. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: Times"><span style="font-family: Helvetica;font-size: 14px">When asked to describe the best part of her job, Jillian speaks about the “multiple hats”  she gets to try on working with a non-profit.  This gives her an opportunity to explore what she is good at and what tasks she specifically enjoys.  Jillian hopes to continue writing more within the Institute for Children, Poverty, and Homelessness and beyond.  At Muhlenberg, she served as the co-editor in chief and writing is where her passion lies and she seeks out opportunities to continue this. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: Times"><span style="font-family: Helvetica;font-size: 14px">For Jen, the best part of her job is it has pushed her outside of her comfort zone.  She was never particularly interested in politics, but her current position at the National Skills Coalition has pushed her to learn more about policy issues. This has awakened a new interest and she plans to remain in her current field and possible pursue a higher degree to further her career prospects in the future. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: Times"><span style="font-family: Helvetica;font-size: 14px">Alumni Week provides students with a unique opportunity to speak with people who recently left your shoes, and can better understand what you may be going through.  It is an important time to ask for advice; and Jillian and Jen both agree that internships are crucial experiences for students.  Jillian also advises students to seek out connections even outside of your major—you never know who you can connect you to a job or internship.  Take time to speak with professors from various departments about your interests and make sure to hold onto those connections.  Jen also adds that students should be open-minded and broaden their scope when searching for internships and jobs.  Oftentimes, students don’t believe they are qualified for certain opportunities, but the truth is we all have great experience from classes, workshops, extracurriculars, and work study jobs.  Jen and Jillian also suggest making a list of courses you’ve taken and highlighting the skills you’ve gained from each and work them into a cover letter.  You may be surprised at how much experience you do have…</span></p>
<p style="font-family: Times"><span style="font-family: Helvetica;font-size: 14px">Both Jillian and Jen shine as examples of successful Muhlenberg College alums who have found careers which continue the Media Communications Department mission of social justice. </span></p>

He told workshop participants&#8211;which included students, faculty, and department alumni&#8211; that 90% of online community users are lurkers who never contribute, 9% of users contribute a little and 1% of users account for almost all of the action. And, of course, Justin urged <em>action</em>. Justin emphasized that today’s college students are primed for social networking because they grew up with technology, they live in a mobile society and they’re way ahead of older generations (who are busy catching up with the technology). And because students are already using all types of free social media, they can create a niche that will pay rewards.</p>
<p>To get started, Justin recommended doing what you love but doing it more publicly and then adding the web to the equation. He emphasized that branding yourself was important, as well as choosing an easy-to-remember name, being consistent, thinking ahead and getting your name out there. Justin also talked about his night job as one of the top New York City nightlife promoters. Using social networking to promote NYC nightlife and with his JustinRZB brand, he earns awards, cash and free passes to the city&#8217;s truly <strong>hot</strong> spots.  In the end, he challenged students to consider “Where do you fit in?”</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Digital Media Assistant Tony Dalton recently produced a video documentary for the Class of 1960 for their 50 year reunion.  Throughout 2009-2010, Tony met with alumni, conducted interviews, gathered and photographed memorabilia, and scoured College archives for items in the <em>Chiarla</em> and <em>Weekly</em> to represent life on campus between 1956 and 1960.  The result is an impressive and entertaining documentary titled <em>Band of Brothers and a Few Sisters</em>.  In working closely with alumni from the Class of &#8217;60, Tony most enjoyed &#8220;listening to their stories and having the opportunity to retell them.&#8221;</p>
