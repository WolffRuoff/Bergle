Kan, M. April 27, 2011. China&#8217;s Baidu Revenue, Profits Up on Strong Traffic Growth.<em> Network World</em>. Retried from <a href="http://www.networkworld.com/news/2011/042811-chinas-baidu-revenue-profits-up.html">http://www.networkworld.com/news/2011/042811-chinas-baidu-revenue-profits-up.html</a></p>
<p>Google dominants search in nearly every corner of the world, except in one: China. Google’s forays into the lucrative Chinese internet search marketplace, which is estimated at 457 million users, have captured less than 20% of the market. Baidu, an eleven year old competitor, offers many similar services to those provided by Google, yet has gained a significant market share by leveraging linking pin power roles. For instance, Baidu is the “default search engine in 80 percent of Andriod phones in China&#8230;because the mobile operating system is open-source software, device manufactures can make changes to it.” Baidu is pre-installed on devices through revenue sharing agreements with manufacturers.</p>
<p><span id="more-1182"></span></p>
<p>Baidu’s power as a exhibitor in the Chinese search market exceeds that of Google in the Unted States (approx. 65%), and rivals Google’s dominance in Europe (closer to 80%). This runs in paradox to the belief that American media power tends to be more concentrated than the European media system. The internet industry differs in this regard from traditional media. One reason may be the entrepreneurial spirit in the United States encourages more imitators and competitors; backed by venture capital firms (an important investor power role in the internet industry) that provide billions of dollars annually to internet start ups.</p>
