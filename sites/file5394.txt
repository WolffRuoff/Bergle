								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I think as an Asian American on Muhlenberg’s campus the idea of privilege is a skewed topic to understand. Most of my time freshman year was spent with the idea that as a person within the “model minority,” I didn’t think my life had much overlap or relatability to warrant the need to say or speak out on the inequalities for students of color. I think this first week of listening to interviews has definitely helped me realize that indifference and detachment from these issues, inherently gives me privilege. I think a pivotal point in understanding how integration for marginalized communities on campus moves forward is by realizing not everyone has the privilege to not talk about these issues. While I realize that intrinsically the idea of pro-social justice seeking movements in general is not appealing to all types of individuals, and balancing how much time and effort one invests into such discussions is completely a personal choice, I would seriously advocate that everyone, no matter what path of life, see the importance of taking part and putting themself in an uncomfortable position, because as a result you will grow to be a better, more educated person. As a result I’m looking forward to sophomore year as a way for me to demonstrate how to be a better ally in the community, as well as help speak out for other students of color that may not necessarily fit into the black or white binary.</p>
