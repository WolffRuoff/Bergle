								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Facebook is just another one of the countless forms of social media that my generation uses to see what their “friends” are doing. One’s news feed is the endless list that updates itself as people upload new content. These news feeds encompass status updates, pictures, and even articles that people like and share. The problem with Facebook occurs when users accept friend requests from people they don&#8217;t actually know. Now these strangers have access to not only personal pictures, but personal information.</p>
<p>Robert Lemieux, a professor in the communication department at McDaniel College, conducted a study about privacy on Facebook. His participants had to construct a fictitious profile with the name Jamie Marple and a profile picture showing both a girl and a boy. The name Jamie was chosen because of the possibility that it could fit either gender. The only other information on the profile aside from the name and the extremely vague picture, was “Jamie’s” date of birth and hometown. “Since the study’s primary interest was to test the likelihood of being accepted as a friend based on limited, personal information, Jamie’s personal information was severely limited” (Lemieux, 2012). Another group of participants within the study were informed to friend Jamie and write on her profile. This made it look like Jamie was real and active user.</p>
<p>The entire purpose of Lemieux’s study was to see if people would accept a friend request from a person with a questionable profile that they really did not know. The results proved that kids are willing to accept friend requests from even the profiles that have meager amounts of information. “Results indicated that 325 Facebook members (72% of the sample) willingly accepted the friendship of the unknown individual” (Lemieux, 2012). More than 50% of Facebook users were willing to welcome a new friendship despite knowing such a minute amount of information about them.</p>
<p>What’s the issue with this? Why is it so bad to casually accept a friend request on Facebook? You see that you have some mutual friends with this persons so it must not be a big deal. Many problems however could come along with the spontaneous action of accepting anyone and everyone. Not only is your privacy in jeopardy, but your security is too. Once accepting that friend request, the person on the other side of the computer has access to very personal information like where you live or where you go to school. They can also see pictures that you post, and pictures other people post of you. One day someone unwanted could find out where you live or the wrong person could see you at a party holding a beer. Would you want that?</p>
