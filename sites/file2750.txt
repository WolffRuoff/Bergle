					<description><![CDATA[American Idol is definitely a champion of synergy.  I think the show provides one of the most blatant examples of integrated advertising with those &quot;Ford music videos&quot; in which the contestants sing and dance around Ford&#039;s latest models (I think contestants even designed their own personalized Ford Fiestas last season).  Though the spots have been ridiculed for their bizarre story lines and shoddy lip syncing, they do leave the audience with little hope of forgetting about the show&#039;s contestants or its sponsor.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The entire American Idol franchise, as you rightly point out, is a fascinating exercise in the power of the linking pin power role.  Artists that are either featured on the program or serve as judges can serve themselves up to a potential music market every night on television, thereby increasing their market clout in the music industry.  The same can be said for the would-be Idols as well - Once they complete the season and one or two of them actually end up with a record contract, they are already household names, thereby minimizing a lot of the risk involved in finding and signing new talent to a record label.  This is nothing new, of course, as you rightly observe - Past TV programs like the Ed Sullivan show, American Bandstand, Soul Train, etc always served to promote talent and to push forward record sales.  Nice analysis here, Group 1!]]></description>
