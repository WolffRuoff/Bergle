(2011, March 28). Ticket thicket at CinemaCon. <em>Variety</em>. Retrieved from <a href="http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118034501?refCatId=4142&amp;query=ticket+thicket+">http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118034501?refCatId=4142&amp;query=ticket+thicket+</a>.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, the task of finding a seat in the theater after the movie had already begun proved to be an impossible task. However, now finding an empty seat is becoming less of a challenge. It has been a grim first quarter of the year for both Hollywood studios and theater owners. For every single weekend of the year thus far, box office revenues have dropped from the equivalent weekends in 2010. At CinemaCon, a convention of the National Association of Theater Owners (NATO) that recently took place in Las Vegas, the box office decline was a prominent topic of conversation.  Not only are consumer habits changing constantly, but last year&#8217;s box office hits &#8220;Avatar&#8221; (2009) and &#8220;Alice in Wonderland&#8221; (2010) drove the box office to record highs during the first half of 2010. And so far this year, there has been a lack of &#8220;event films&#8221; able to rake in large numbers of ticket sales and attract audiences in a way comparable to last year. <span id="more-1062"></span></p>
<p>At CinemaCon, much of the conference&#8217;s discussion has centered around hopes that this summer&#8217;s films will help erase some of the box office deficit. With known properties and sequels such as &#8220;Scream 4,&#8221; &#8220;Fast Five,&#8221; &#8220;Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,&#8221; &#8220;The Hangover Part II,&#8221; &#8220;Cars 2,&#8221; &#8220;Transformers 3,&#8221; and the final installment of &#8220;Harry Potter&#8221; due in theaters between now and July, Hollywood is hoping that moviegoers will be lured back to theaters to see follow-ups to previous successes.  Several of the major studios, including Paramount, DreamWorks, Disney, Warner Bros. and Lionsgate showcased some of their upcoming products at the convention. Sony screened an entire film, the July comedy &#8220;Zookeeper&#8221; starring Kevin James.</p>
<p>CinemaCon, which used to be known as ShoWest, conducted its first-ever conference under that name this year. In an effort to increase studio participation at the conference and encourage attendance among smaller film exhibitors, NATO will begin managing the conference on a non-profit basis. During a time when decreased attendance and other factors have contributed more than ever to box office declines, CinemaCon was an important week for exhibitors as they discussed strategies and changing consumer habits. &#8220;In this day and age, with so many ancillary avenues fighting for the leisure dollar, we have to be at the top of our game,&#8221; said CinemaCon managing director Mitch Neuhauser. &#8220;That&#8217;s really what we&#8217;re keying the conference on: What does it take?&#8221;</p>
<p>As we discussed in our blog last week, a new premium video-on-demand service is proving controversial in the motion picture industry. Making feature films available on demand in a relatively short window following release, this service was a notable point of conversation about CinemaCon. The video-on-demand service is reflective of some of the changes happening within the entertainment industry that could affect how consumers are willing to spend their money. It remains to be seen what kind of impact this specific service will actually have on box office revenues, but it seems clear at this point in time that exhibitors and studios are both counting on the box office receiving a much-needed shot in the arm.</p>
<p>The sheer number of films being released in this summer based on products that previously saw success is an indication that studios are hoping familiarity will bring people back into movie theaters. CinemaCon is a clear example of a power role attempting to maintain their grip on the industry. Exhibitors spent the entire week of CinemaCon discussing the ins and outs of the industry and the current state of box office sales. CinemaCon was an outlet that allowed not only the screening of footage but gave exhibitors and studios a chance to interact. With the common goal of boosting box office and erasing some of the industry&#8217;s current fears, exhibitors and studios used CinemaCon as an opportunity to plan for the future.</p>
