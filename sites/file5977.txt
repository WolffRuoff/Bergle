			<p>Erica Wenzel knew it was only a matter of time before she broke the Muhlenberg softball program’s all-time record for runs scored.</p>
<div id="attachment_2223" style="width: 270px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/03/wenzel_scoringrun.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2223" class="size-full wp-image-2223" alt="this" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/03/wenzel_scoringrun.jpg" width="260" height="478" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/03/wenzel_scoringrun.jpg 260w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/03/wenzel_scoringrun-163x300.jpg 163w" sizes="(max-width: 260px) 100vw, 260px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2223" class="wp-caption-text">this</p></div>
<p>Needing to cross the plate two more times entering Thursday’s doubleheader at Swarthmore, the senior co-captain figured it would happen soon. She just didn’t expect the milestone to happen quite like this.</p>
<p>Wenzel matched and broke the record in the same inning, a 10-run third frame in the nightcap that propelled the Mules to a 10-0 victory and a sweep of the twin bill. To the casual observer, Wenzel’s two runs might have seemed like just a footnote in a historic explosion &#8211; it was the first time that Muhlenberg posted a 10-run inning in a game in which there was no other scoring.</p>
<p>Indeed, coach Marisa DeStasio informed Wenzel of her accomplishment after the game, but during it she was blissfully unaware of her own piece of history.</p>
<p>“I knew I was somewhere close, but that wasn’t really my priority,” Wenzel said. “That wasn’t something I think about when I’m playing.</p>
<p>“I hadn’t really thought about that, either (both runs coming in the same inning). Now that I do, that’s pretty exciting.”</p>
<p>Thursday’s nightcap was the 134th shutout in program history, and the 34th in which the Mules did all of the game’s scoring in a single inning. The previous high total, however, was only five – in a victory over Franklin &amp; Marshall in 1989. The Mules doubled their pleasure with their first 10-run frame since 2012.</p>
<p>Wenzel began the parade with a single to left center, one of 10 hits for the Mules in the inning &#8211; one shy of the school record. She advanced to second on a wild pitch and came around to score on a grand slam by Taylor Trifiolis. That tied the program record set by Devon Barber last year. Wenzel wouldn’t have to wait long to top it.</p>
<p>The Mules sent 15 batters to the plate in the inning, Wenzel’s second turn making her the 11th. With two outs, she worked a walk, then took third on an RBI single by Kelly Kline. Wenzel crossed the plate for the 116th time on a single up the middle by Trifiolis, who she can thank for her record-tying and record-setting runs.</p>
<p>Over the course of her career, Wenzel has certainly had plenty of help.</p>
<p>“We have a very strong team and a lot of good hitters,” Wenzel said. “I owe a lot of my stats to the rest of my team for being able to drive me in. Everyone played a part in that inning.”</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/03/wenzel_MB.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2224" alt="Erica Wenzel" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/03/wenzel_MB.jpg" width="350" height="351" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/03/wenzel_MB.jpg 350w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/03/wenzel_MB-150x150.jpg 150w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/03/wenzel_MB-300x300.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/03/wenzel_MB-299x300.jpg 299w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" /></a>Wenzel, who ranks sixth in program history with 143 hits and inside the top 10 in doubles, extra-base hits and total bases, never expected to be setting records at the collegiate level.</p>
<p>“Definitely not,” she admitted. “I was just hoping to play, and play to the best of my abilities.”</p>
<p>To eclipse the mark set by Barber – a teammate and friend for three years – made it that much more special.</p>
<p>“I’m honored that it was Devon,” Wenzel said. “She was a great player, and to have my name up there with hers is really awesome.”</p>
<p>Wenzel, however, may not be out of the woods just yet. Kline, already the all-time leader in home runs, extra-base hits and total bases, is only 14 runs behind and has already clubbed six homers this season. Still, as long as Wenzel keeps getting on base – she’s hitting .410 with a .479 OBP – Kline is likely to bring her home.</p>
<p>“I guess if she does pass me, then good for her,” Wenzel said with a laugh. “She’s been doing really well this year and I hope she continues to do really well. If either of us is scoring it’s good for the team.”</p>

			<p><em>The Muhlenberg softball team recently participated in a pair of community service projects. Junior outfielder Alyssa Schell fills us in:</em></p>
<p><em></em>If you were awake at 8:00am on a recent Sunday morning, you might have seen the softball team convening outside in the ML parking lot. We were all gathering with plans to head over to the 6<sup>th</sup> Street Shelter in Allentown.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/12/softbig_MB121813.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2140" alt="softball at 6th Street Shelter" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/12/softbig_MB121813.jpg" width="780" height="444" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/12/softbig_MB121813.jpg 780w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/12/softbig_MB121813-300x170.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/12/softbig_MB121813-500x284.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" /></a></p>
<p>The 6<sup>th</sup> Street Shelter is a shelter that specializes in family living. The shelter is unique in doing just that. Instead of dormitory style living, the shelter offers suite style apartments to keep families together during hard times. The hard facts are that 38 percent of those homeless in the Lehigh Valley are children. The shelter combats the dispersing of families and helps set up employment and financial planning for the families that go through the shelter.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/12/sheltercleanup1.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2137" alt="shelter cleanup" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/12/sheltercleanup1-300x201.jpg" width="300" height="201" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/12/sheltercleanup1-300x201.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/12/sheltercleanup1.jpg 425w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>The team helped clean the property around the shelter. We raked and swept up leaves, cleaned up trash that blew in from that week’s heavy wind, cleaned up the shelter’s playground, pulled weeds and even cleared off a fence covered with dead poison ivy. The team tackled this large task by splitting into groups of twos, where each group focused on a separate section of the perimeter of the shelter.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/12/sheltercleanup3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2139" alt="shelter cleanup" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/12/sheltercleanup3.jpg" width="500" height="248" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/12/sheltercleanup3.jpg 500w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/12/sheltercleanup3-300x148.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/12/sheltercleanup2.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2138" alt="shelter cleanup" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/12/sheltercleanup2-253x300.jpg" width="253" height="300" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/12/sheltercleanup2-253x300.jpg 253w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/12/sheltercleanup2.jpg 315w" sizes="(max-width: 253px) 100vw, 253px" /></a>Having all my team members rallying together in order to make a difference in the appearance of the shelter was truly heartwarming. Even though raking leaves can seem like something minimal, you could tell that the small deed goes a long way in helping the confidence of the residents at the shelter.</p>
<p>By the end, team members were asking the employees how we could further help the shelter. The shelter does not typically take clothing donations because of the lack of space. However, the shelter does take donations of cleaning supplies and still needs volunteers. If you are interested in volunteering or even learning more about the 6<sup>th</sup> Street Shelter, go to <a href="http://www2.caclv.org">http://www2.caclv.org</a>.</p>
<p>That Thursday, members of the team assembled and made the trek to Roosevelt Elementary School to participate in their annual Book Blast. One Thursday a month, students and their parents listen to stories and participate in crafts relating to a particular theme. The theme that our team participated was “America and Your Country.”</p>
<p>Our team read and helped with crafts in which the students created their own country where they had to decide their name, national bird, capital, etc. At the end, there was a raffle to determine the student who could take the book we read home.</p>
<p>The team’s combined effort to make an enjoyable experience for these young students was wonderful. Our team was split up again in separate classrooms and I found it very inspiring that in my classroom, the parents were talking to their first- graders and pointing at me saying that one day, if they worked hard enough they could go to college like me. I found that being in the classroom as a college student gave the kids something to strive for.</p>
<p>I know that many volunteers have helped me get to where I am today, and I am glad to give back and possibly help a child progress in their life like someone has done for me.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Wow, did that really happen?&#8221; quipped senior CJ Graetzer as the elated Muhlenberg women&#8217;s soccer team filed onto the bus following its shootout win against McDaniel in the first round of the Centennial Conference playoffs on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Yes, it did happen. And it, or something like it, has happened before &#8211; about 17 times in the last 27 years.</p>
<p>Following is a list of Muhlenberg &#8220;Playoff Walkoffs&#8221; &#8211; postseason contests that were decided on the last play and enabled a Mule team to advance or win a championship. (We stretched the definition of &#8220;last play&#8221; slightly for the two basketball games.)</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/wsocbig_110513.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2065" alt="women's soccer 2013" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/wsocbig_110513.jpg" width="400" height="228" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/wsocbig_110513.jpg 400w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/wsocbig_110513-300x171.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></a>Women&#8217;s Soccer vs. McDaniel, 2013</strong></p>
<p>After a scoreless tie, the Mules won the penalty kick shootout, 4-3, to advance to the Centennial Conference semifinals. Amanda Wong stopped a Green Terror PK on the final play of the game.</p>

<p><strong>Men&#8217;s Basketball vs. Gettysburg, 2013</strong></p>
<p>Malique Killing hit a jumper from the top of the key with seven-tenths of a second remaining for a 45-43 win in a CC first-round game.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/chiliwilliams.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2066" alt="Alexandra Chili" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/chiliwilliams.jpg" width="225" height="487" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/chiliwilliams.jpg 225w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/chiliwilliams-138x300.jpg 138w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /></a>Women&#8217;s Basketball vs. Williams, 2011</strong></p>
<p>Alexandra Chili&#8217;s step-back three from the corner with one second left lifted the Mules to a 64-63 win in the first round of the NCAA Tournament. Muhlenberg went on to defeat Rochester the next day to advance to the &#8220;Sweet 16.&#8221;</p>
<p>video: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOMzz2DKlzU">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOMzz2DKlzU</a></p>
<p><strong>Men&#8217;s Soccer vs. Stevens, 2010</strong></p>
<p>Stevens was ranked 13th in Division III, owned a 34-match home unbeaten streak and had not lost in the NCAA Tournament (except on penalty kicks) since 2005 &#8211; until Josh Luginbuhl scored a &#8220;Golden Goal&#8221; with 3:21 left in double overtime to send Muhlenberg to the &#8220;Sweet 16&#8221; with a 2-1 win.</p>

<p><strong>Softball vs. Gettysburg, 2009</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg trailed 5-3 heading into the bottom of the seventh of this CC first-round playoff game. Four singles cut the deficit to one run, and then Samantha Crist hit a walkoff grand slam for an 8-5 win. It wound up winning the championship for the Mules, who were awarded the title as the highest remaining seed when the tournament was rained out the next day.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/kliewer.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2068" alt="Jonathan Kliewer" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/kliewer.jpg" width="216" height="238" /></a>Men&#8217;s Soccer vs. Franklin &amp; Marshall, 2004</strong></p>
<p>The Mules were 0-3 in overtime games for the season before Jonathan Kliewer, playing near his hometown of Ephrata, Pa., scored a &#8220;Golden Goal&#8221; 1:21 into extra time for a 1-0 win in the first round of the CC playoffs.</p>
<p><strong>Men&#8217;s Soccer vs. Gordon, 2003</strong></p>
<p>In the first round of the NCAA Tournament, Evan Smallwood converted a PK with five minutes left in regulation to tie the game at 2-2. After two scoreless overtime periods, Smallwood ended the shootout with another successful penalty.</p>
<p><strong>Softball vs. Merchant Marine, 2003</strong></p>
<p>Tied 5-5 after four innings, the Mules and Mariners battled through seven scoreless innings in this NCAA Tournament elimination game. Kristen Best finally ended the marathon game with a walkoff single in the bottom of the 12th.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/wsocecac1999.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2069" alt="women's soccer 1999" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/wsocecac1999.jpg" width="400" height="242" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/wsocecac1999.jpg 400w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/wsocecac1999-300x181.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></a>Women&#8217;s Soccer vs. Johns Hopkins, 1999</strong></p>
<p>Maybe the best career postseason walkoff in Muhlenberg history: Hilary Moses (No. 4 in the picture), a senior whose playing time had been limited by injuries, made the winning penalty kick in the ECAC championship game on the final play of her Mule career.</p>
<p><strong>Men&#8217;s Soccer vs. Messiah, 1995</strong></p>
<p>The latest into the postseason for a Muhlenberg walkoff; Todd Ervin&#8217;s &#8220;Golden Goal&#8221; in the 126th minute (overtimes were 15 minutes then, and teams played as many as four before going into PKs) on a frigid night gave the 10th-ranked Mules a 1-0 win against the third-ranked Falcons in an NCAA regional final. Muhlenberg defeated Ithaca the following weekend to advance to the &#8220;Final Four.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Men&#8217;s Soccer vs. Carnegie Mellon, 1994</strong></p>
<p>In an NCAA Tournament first-round game hosted by Muhlenberg, regulation play and overtime went on without a goal. Thomas Auchenbach made the 10th and final penalty kick to give the Mules a 3-2 win in the shootout and send them to the second round for the first time in program history.</p>
<p>video: <a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/msoc1994.wmv">men&#8217;s soccer 1994</a></p>
<p><em>(This game also serves as proof that 20-year-old VHS tapes still work.)</em></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/soft1991.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2070" alt="softball 1991" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/soft1991.jpg" width="300" height="341" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/soft1991.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/soft1991-263x300.jpg 263w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Softball, 1989-92</strong></p>
<p>The softball team made a habit of going to the postseason in the late &#8217;80s and early &#8217;90s, and they also made a habit of winning games in dramatic fashion. The Mules posted walkoff wins against Wilkes in the 1989 NCAA Tournament (on an RBI single by Laura Williams), Mount Union twice in the 1990 NCAA Tournament (RBI single by Val Verenna and three-run triple/error by Kim Lapple) and Franklin &amp; Marshall in the 1991 MAC playoffs (RBI grounder by Karen Brown). The pick of the group, however, was a walkoff single by freshman Tara Molloy in the bottom of the eighth for a 4-3 win against Elizabethtown in the 1992 MAC championship game.</p>
<p><strong>Men&#8217;s Soccer vs. Johns Hopkins, 1987</strong></p>
<p>Six years away from becoming fierce Centennial Conference rivals, Muhlenberg and Hopkins played a wild MAC South championship game. The Mules took leads of 2-1 and 3-2 in the first two overtime periods (which were not sudden death at the time), only to have the Blue Jays tie the score both times. Off to a shootout the match went. With the entire Muhlenberg football team (which was practicing on the adjacent field) looking on, Bert Mukkulainen completed a perfect Mule run through the round of five PKs by converting the winning shot after the fourth Hopkins shooter missed high.</p>

			<p><em>Profiles of senior Muhlenberg athletes are published in game programs in the sports of field hockey, football, soccer, volleyball, basketball, wrestling, baseball, softball, lacrosse and tennis, usually on that sport’s Senior Day.</em></p>
<p><em>As part of the Year in Review, here are some of the best responses in the Q&amp;A profiles from the winter and spring athletes.</em></p>
<p><strong>Matt O’Hara, Men&#8217;s Basketball</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you could trade places with anyone for a day, who would it be? </strong>Truthfully, in a completely non-weird way, I’d love to be on the girls’ basketball team. They have the best team chemistry at this school and some of my best friends are on that team: Julie Kelly, Alita Zabrecky and Kate Clawson, plus the whole sophomore class. They are a great team with great girls who have a ton of fun together.</p>

<p><strong>What was it like student teaching this past fall semester? </strong>Student teaching and playing basketball was an enjoyable hell. I would wake up every morning at six and hang out with a bunch of little prepubescent eighth graders. It was great because they would actually get my jokes and appreciate me acting like an idiot for their entertainment. After I was done yelling at those little whirling dervishes, and maybe teaching them a thing or two about the Mayan Empire, I would drive back to school, shove food down my throat and then get yelled at during practice. In the midst of all of this chaos, I would somehow do homework and sleep (sometimes during practice&#8230;) and I eventually became a master of the chaos. The worst part about all of this running around was that I loved every second of my time being Mr. Lags.</p>
<p><strong>Alita Zabrecky, Women&#8217;s Basketball</strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s the most memorable game of your Muhlenberg career? </strong>My most memorable game was, by far, my freshman year at Gettysburg. For some reason Coach had both Kate Clawson and I on the floor late in the game, down by one, with just seconds to go. We had the ball on the sideline out of bounds and our play was designed to get either Kelly [McKeon] or Alex [Chili] the ball so they could shoot, but they were not able to get open so by default, they had to pass to me. I started dribbling toward the basket and the next thing I know I am dribbling the ball off of my foot, thankfully right in the direction of Kate who snatched it up off of the floor. Once Kate had secured the ball I figured my best bet was just to stay out of the way and run to the basket to grab a rebound if someone missed a shot. After almost turning the ball over, I figured I probably should not be taking the last shot of the game. Kate now throws the ball into Sheila Cook in the post, and as I am making my way to the basket, Sheila throws the ball to me, assuming I am making a cut and that I wanted the ball (which I did not). It bounced off my chest, and I caught it and laid it in for the game-winning bucket. This play was by far the most dysfunctional game-winning play I have ever been a part of. I am just thankful that I made the layup given my track record of missed layups.</p>
<p><strong>Ted Albanese, Men&#8217;s Lacrosse</strong></p>
<p><strong>How did you get started playing lacrosse? </strong>I started playing lacrosse when I was 10 years old and in fourth grade. My career conveniently started when my baseball career ended (I didn&#8217;t make the travel team). It&#8217;s a funny story actually. The night I found out I didn&#8217;t make the baseball team, I also found out my pet hermit crab died, so that was a rough night.</p>

<p align="left"><strong>What was it like playing with your brother at Muhlenberg? </strong>Since I was born, my brother was always right there at my side &#8230; By the time I was a senior in high school, &#8230; the only one I had in mind was Muhlenberg so I could play with my brother. When spring of my freshman year finally came, it felt like Christmas came early. As the team hit the field for the first time, I just saw my brother and I walking out to the backyard to have a catch. When lined up to guard him in practice, he’ll say he got the best of my every time, but he doesn’t want to admit his little brother came in as a freshman and put him on an island day in and day out. It was one thing to practice together, but to play in the games with each other made it even more special. Hearing, &#8220;Carpetto brothers you’re next on defense&#8221; was something that gave me chills every game.</p>

<p align="left"><strong>What’s one possession you couldn’t live without? </strong>The possession I can’t live without is the bond and relationships I have developed with my teammates. This outweighs any material possession I own and is something that will last a lifetime.</p>

<p><strong>What’s one thing on your bucket list? </strong>To go to the Everglades and finally see and/or wrestle an alligator … I’d be okay with either.</p>

<p><strong>Describe Coach DeStasio in one word. </strong>I would describe Coach DeStasio as a “non-hugger.” This year we divided our team into “huggers” and the “touch me and die” group, otherwise known as “non-huggers.” Having grown up with the president of the “huggers,” Angie Sisco, I am definitely part of the “non-hugging” group and it’s great to have a coach that shares my views on this matter.</p>

<p><strong>What off-the-court accomplishment are you most proud of? </strong>One off-the-court accomplishment I am proud of is getting into Muhlenberg. I worked hard to get here, and it has been a remarkable journey that I am so privileged to have had.</p>

<p><strong>This is your second year as team captain. What has been the most rewarding part of leading the team for two years? </strong>The most rewarding part of being captain is being able to see all of my fellow teammates grow not only as tennis players, but as people – on and off the court. On the court especially, I have seen so many of my fellow teammates get more and more confident in their games and play some truly amazing tennis. Every one of them motivates me to be a better tennis player and even though I am captain, I think I look up to them for all that they do and their tennis skills. We spend so much time together during the season and I feel really lucky to have met such a smart, fun, loving group of girls … I am so honored to hold this position for my team.</p>

<p><strong>Do you have any pregame rituals or superstitions? </strong>My teammates will call me the most superstitious person on the team, and I’d have to agree. I’ve been wearing the same bow in my hair for game day throughout my four years here. I have two main rituals &#8211; one is taking a shower before every game. I started doing this my freshman year and when I started having success on the field, I knew I had to keep it. It’s a way of thinking about the game and what I want to accomplish. The second ritual also started my freshman year &#8211; a senior at the time (Alyssa Bascelli) told me about her pregame ritual of eating a pint of Ben &amp; Jerry’s ice cream the night before every game. She informed us that someone had to do it with her so that when she graduated, it would get passed down. I was the willing (and maybe not so intelligent) freshman who said, “Sure!” and proceeded to eat a pint of Ben &amp; Jerry’s Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough ice cream the night before every game. I have for all four years and now that I am graduating, I have passed the ritual down to freshmen Rachel Pedersen and Casey Armstrong. You guys better not disappoint me!</p>

<p><strong>Your middle name, Zoe, is pretty unique. Were you named after someone? </strong>I am named after my Greek grandmother (my Yiayia) whose name was Bessie Zoe Athanasiou. Zoe means “life” in Greek and was the perfect portrayal of my Yiayia who is sadly no longer with us. We also both had only one dimple on our left cheeks. This was something we shared and something she always loved about the two of us. I am honored to be named after my Yiayia, and her spirit lives on and will continue to live on through me as I share her name.  </p>

<p><strong>What’s it like having six siblings? Are you the youngest, oldest or in the middle? </strong>I am the third oldest of seven. My brother, Joey, is the oldest, then I have one older sister, Kelly, and four younger sisters, Erin, Mary Kate, Maggie and Tara. People generally feel sorry for my brother for being the only boy, but they shouldn’t because he is treated like a king (and acts like it). The biggest issue with having six siblings, and especially five sisters, is that you cannot leave any personal items unattended, especially clothing, because you will never get it back.</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Rechten, Baseball</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do you have any pregame rituals or superstitions? </strong>I have way too many superstitions and rituals to even name them all – from the way I put on my cleats to the made-up gibberish language our catcher Brett Rosen and I use to communicate before I pitch. The most meaningful and consistent ritual I have revolves around the word “trust.” The importance of this word was instilled in me by my high school coach. Before the inning begins he would tell me to clear off the mound and envision the word trust printed on the rubber. This year I printed it on the brim of my hat. It has served as my anchor, allowing me to take all the emotion out of the situation and focus on doing my job for our team.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/05/velys_yir.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1781" title="Tim Velys" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/05/velys_yir.jpg" alt="" width="186" height="350" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/05/velys_yir.jpg 186w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/05/velys_yir-159x300.jpg 159w" sizes="(max-width: 186px) 100vw, 186px" /></a>Tim Velys, Baseball</strong></p>
<p><strong>How is it being teammates with Ryan Rechten? </strong>As a player, Ryan is one of the more loose and goofy kids on the team – he always has something ridiculous to say. The best part about this is that it makes everyone around him relaxed and reminds us that baseball is just a game and that we must treat it that way if we want to be successful. What I commend him for is his ability to joke around and have fun in the bullpen for six innings of the game and then turn it on right around the sixth knowing that it is his job to come in late and shut the door against the opposing team. I couldn’t think of a better person to have in this role as I have all the confidence in the world that he will come in and get outs in a hurry.</p>
<p><strong>Rob Shannon, Baseball</strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s it like having nine older siblings? </strong>Having nine older siblings is the most incredible thing in my life. It is something that I truly treasure. I am so blessed to have them because they have truly made me into the person I am today. They mean more to me than words can capture. I wear the number nine to represent them.</p>
<p><strong>Robert Appleby, Baseball</strong></p>
<p><strong>How did you get started playing baseball and what’s your first memory of playing?</strong>I’m not really sure how I got started but when I did start playing at the age of 4, I was instantly obsessed. My first memory of actually playing baseball was my first year of tee ball. The league rules were that there were no outs and each team got to hit through the lineup every inning. I remember being at shortstop when this kid hit a line drive to me, which I caught and doubled off the runner at first base. Even though I made the play, he still got to stay on base. I remember how excited I was when I was old enough to play in the league where you could actually get people out. As a hitter now, I take back ever thinking that.</p>

<p><em>Kline owns two of the top three single-season RBI totals in program history &#8211; mostly due to her clutch hitting and teammates getting on in front of her, some due simply to her power. There&#8217;s only one teammate she&#8217;s driven in more than herself.  </em></p>

			<p><em>With the spring sports season just about wrapped up, we will be taking a closer look at Muhlenberg’s senior student-athletes.</em></p>
<p><em>We continue with softball. Seniors Brittany Blohm and Shelby Smith celebrated Senior Day in style, sweeping Franklin &amp; Marshall, 4-0 and 6-5.</em></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/05/blohmhs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1167" title="blohmhs" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/05/blohmhs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Brittany Blohm</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do you have any hidden or unusual talents? </strong>I am pretty good at playing poker. When I was younger my family told me I should work as a card dealer.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>How much of an accomplishment is it having 100 career hits and ranking fourth in school history in doubles? </strong>I feel very accomplished having 100 career hits and ranking fourth in doubles. I just go up there concentrating on having good at-bats and hitting the ball hard somewhere. That is all that I can control. I really enjoy hitting and helping my team out at the plate. I also know that I am not very fast, so making the career triples list was not going to happen.</p>
<p><strong>Is there one play or at-bat that sticks out in your mind? </strong>A play that sticks out in my mind is when we got the last out of the game at the plate in the Centennial Conference playoffs last year. It was very exciting to make the play and know that we won the game. For an at-bat it would have to be when I hit a grand slam. That was the first one I had ever hit. <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What do you feel are your strengths as a catcher? </strong>My strengths as a catcher are getting along well with umpires (or as my teammates and coaches would say, “flirting” with the umpires), blocking balls in the dirt and being able to call a good game for the pitchers.</p>
<p><strong>What’s the best off-the-field memory from your time here? </strong>My best off-the-field memory from here is all the friends that I have made. They are some of my best friends. I also will miss our team pants talk. These pants are not easy to wear!</p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans? </strong>I am currently applying to grad schools to get my teaching certification in elementary education. I hope to be a teacher soon!</p>
<p><strong>What kind of person is Shelby Smith? </strong>Shelby is a very positive person. She knows how to keep everyone happy, and you rarely see her without a smile on her face. I have enjoyed playing with her the past four years. She is a leader and very versatile player. She is my tanning buddy, and I will miss her “GO Shelby” dance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/05/smithhs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1168" title="smithhs" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/05/smithhs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Shelby Smith</strong><em></em></p>
<p><strong>What’s something most people don’t know about you that they might find interesting? </strong>I have been coming to Muhlenberg softball camps since I was 9 years old. That means that I have been coming to this campus or the Muhlenberg field for the past 13 years. I always enjoyed camp as a young player and dreamt that one day I could be one of the Muhlenberg softball players who was teaching the younger girls and helping them refine their skills. I accomplished that dream and made it a reality. Muhlenberg has been part of my life for many years, and I believe that Muhlenberg truly is where I was meant to be. <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s your most memorable Muhlenberg softball memory? </strong>My most memorable Muhlenberg softball memory has to be the conference championship weekend last year. It was not only one of the most memorable weekends because we won the conference championship, but the team also had so much fun being together and singing along to music (especially the Lion King) on the bus. There has never been a moment that I was happier to be part of such an amazing group of girls. I can honestly say that being part of this team the last four years has allowed me to be part of a special softball family here at Muhlenberg. All the girls I have met over the years have truly become my best friends and a very special part of my life. We cried, laughed, teased each other and confided in each other. Each of us is different in many ways, but we bring the best out of each other. We are truly a team that supports each other to the fullest. My most memorable Muhlenberg softball memory will be all the amazing people I have met by playing this sport throughout my years here. <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s the best off-the-field memory from your time here? </strong>My semester in Washington D.C. is my best off-the-field memory and an experience that I will never forget. I have fallen in love with the city, and my internship provided me the opportunity to not only live in our nation’s capital, but to learn about it firsthand. The Washington Semester enhanced my college education greatly. We went to our internships during the day and had class in the evenings. One day a week we had field trips and explored many of our national monuments. I learned to live in an entirely different environment, and I really enjoyed it. I had the chance to do many things in Washington that I would not have done if I did not participate in the semester. I not only made many new friends during the experience, but I was able to grow personally. I gained a new perspective of our nation’s capital, and I look forward to returning there one day in the future. It was a life-changing experience that I will never forget.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans? </strong>After I graduate from college I hope to find a position which will utilize the knowledge and skills I have gained during my four years at Muhlenberg. I think it is important that a person enjoys his or her career and feels fulfilled doing it, while still being open to any new avenues he or she can explore to further develop important skills. <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s Brittany Blohm like off the field? </strong>There is truly not a better friend you could ask for than Brittany. Off the field, she is someone whom her friends and teammates can confide in, no matter what the circumstance. She has a passion for life and knows how to have a great time. She is a great listener and is able to inspire each one of us to do our very best. Brittany is a true leader and has a very determined spirit. We enjoy getting together listening to music and just talking. She has a great personality and a beautiful, caring heart. I know that she will be successful in whichever path she takes in life after Muhlenberg.</p>

<p>Jones went 2-0 with a save in a 4-0 week for the Mules. She allowed only two earned runs in 16 1/3 innings for a 0.86 ERA while striking out 15, walking none and holding opponents to a .194 batting average. In Muhlenberg&#8217;s final Centennial Conference doubleheader, she pitched a five-hit shutout in the first game and earned a save in the second. The15 strikeouts gave her 91 for the season, a school record for freshmen.</p>

<p>Rispoli finished his career with an incredible performance in the Mules&#8217; 14-11 loss to Haverford. He was 21-for-26 on faceoffs, breaking the school records for faceoffs won and ground balls (19) in a game, and assisted on two goals. Rispoli also became Muhlenberg&#8217;s all-time career leader with 240 career faceoffs won. He finished fourth on the all-time list for ground balls (156).</p>

<p><em>Yesterday, mathematics/computer science professor Michael Huber gave a <a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/?p=1042">faculty perspective</a>.</em></p>
<p><em>Today&#8217;s guest writer is Marisa DeStasio, head coach of the Muhlenberg softball team. DeStasio is in her second season with the Mules; in her first, she coached the team to the Centennial Conference championship. Like Dr. Huber, who taught at Army before coming to Muhlenberg, DeStasio has a Division I background.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/destasiohs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1052" title="Marisa DeStasio" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/destasiohs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>It is August and finally sunny in the southern tier of New York. Although it is a warm day, the sweat dripping down my forehead is not because of the sun. I am standing on the starting line of the track with my teammates, most of whom I barely know yet. “Go!” screamed my new coach, so I ran and I ran and I ran. I ran for an entire mile! Yes, all 5,280 feet!</p>
<p>I was freshman at Binghamton University and a new member of the softball team. It was the point in my life when my biggest stressor was running the timed mile. I can still feel the nervousness flowing through my body on that day. In hindsight, I realize running a mile is not a big deal and really not all that challenging, but give me a break… I was a naïve freshman.  The month and a half of our fall season had just begun and so had a new school year.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/destasio1.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1053" title="Marisa DeStasio" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/destasio1.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="515" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/destasio1.jpg 250w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/destasio1-145x300.jpg 145w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px" /></a>During the fall, we had practice every day with tournaments on the weekends until the end of October. Three times a week we were also required to lift with our strength coach. However, the end of the fall marked the beginning of our offseason training regimen. Monday through Friday we had either 7 a.m. conditioning or lifting sessions and then individual skill workouts with our coaches in the afternoon. We had a countdown in the locker room of when our next dreaded conditioning day was, so we could mentally prepare ourselves for sprint torture.</p>
<p>Over winter break we were given a lifting and conditioning workout packet. Upon our return, we would “max out” with the strength coach and once again run the dreaded mile with the goal of beating our previous time from the fall. (Thankfully, I always did.) It was comforting when spring practice finally started because all our hard work would pay off soon.</p>
<p>In Division I, you get the chance to travel all over the country, albeit mostly on a smelly, bumpy charter bus. Sometimes you drive sixteen hours in one weekend and live in a hotel room just to get beat up on by nationally ranked teams. Our goal every year was the same, make the America East Conference Tournament. We may have come up shy, but it did not make my experience at Binghamton any less rewarding. It was certainly not glamorous and you often ask yourself why you do it. The answer is always the same, because you love to play the sport.</p>
<p>After working with student-athletes at Muhlenberg for the last three years, I realize some of the similarities and differences between divisions have nothing to do with skill. This campus has shown me the true meaning of “student-athlete.”</p>
<p>Being a Division I athlete is like having a job, with little time for anything else other than classes and your sport. At the time, I was not interested in expanding my horizons beyond softball and certainly could not fathom life after Binghamton. I should have been more focused on my future.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/destasio2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1054" title="softball team" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/destasio2.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="158" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/destasio2.jpg 500w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/destasio2-300x94.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>This cannot be said for the student-athletes at Muhlenberg. Everyone here is committed to success both in academics and athletics. And from what I can tell, it comes from pure self-motivation. They work extremely hard in the classroom and then on the field, while also striving to make a difference in the community. They wake up early for practice, they sprint just as hard, they are just as competitive, and they hate running the mile just as much as I did. The bottom line is they want to win.</p>
<p>In the end, it does not matter what division you play because the ultimate goal is an education. A mile is still 5,280 feet, and we all play for love of the sport.</p>

			<p>In the third inning of the Muhlenberg softball team’s game at McDaniel, a Mule fan looked toward the on-deck circle and said, “Oh, Kelly’s up next, I need to get my front row seat,” before hurrying to the first row of the bleachers.</p>
<p>That’s because when the sophomore first baseman steps to the plate, it is more than just an at-bat, it’s a chance to witness history.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/kline_blog.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1039" title="Kelly Kline" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/kline_blog.jpg" alt="" width="330" height="458" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/kline_blog.jpg 330w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/kline_blog-216x300.jpg 216w" sizes="(max-width: 330px) 100vw, 330px" /></a>Moments after the fan got to his seat, Kline sent a towering shot over the right-center fence for her third straight home run. It was just the latest in what has been a sizzling season for Kline. And her onslaught at McDaniel helped her leave some impressive marks on the school record book.</p>
<p>The three straight blasts, one in the opener and two in game two, not only kept her school-record hitting streak intact at 23 games, but they moved her season home run total to nine, breaking the Mule single-season record of seven set last season by two-time CC player of the year Ashley Brewer.</p>
<p>They also moved her within one of Brewer’s career home run mark of 13 less than two seasons into her career, which Kline could hardly believe.</p>
<p>“I had no idea,” Kline said when told about the season record. “Ashley was a great player; I really looked up to her. She helped me a lot as a freshman. To be mentioned with her is incredible. It means a lot.”</p>
<p>Through games of last Sunday, Kline led the CC and ranked in top five in Division III in batting average (.519) and slugging percentage (1.013). Her 23-game hit streak is five more than the previous Mule record. She’s also two home runs shy of the CC single-season mark.</p>
<p>But wait, there’s more!</p>
<p>Kline needs only one more extra-base hit to tie the program season record of 20, and she currently sits third on the single-season lists for total bases (78, 11 shy of second and 15 away from first) and RBI (34, 2 away from second and 17 shy of first).</p>
<p>There’s more than enough numbers and records to make heads spin. But it’s nothing compared to head spinning that comes from trying to figure out how to get Kline out.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why McDaniel gave Kline the &#8220;Barry Bonds&#8221; treatment in the second game of Saturday&#8217;s doubleheader, walking her intentionally to start the sixth inning despite having a six-run lead.</p>
<p>Kline can hit for both power and average, and she can make things happen when she gets on base, witnessed by her team-high 26 runs scored.</p>
<p>Much of her success comes from the time and effort she puts in every day at practice. Senior Shelby Smith said Kline is the hardest worker on the team, and makes everybody better just by being in the lineup.</p>
<p>“She’s amazing,” Smith said of Kline. “She hits the ball so hard, and you think she’s going to get a hit every time. She’s just a great player and a great teammate.” </p>
<p>But for all the astronomical numbers and tape measure shots she’s been putting up this season, Kline said she just tries to keep things simple when it comes to hitting.</p>
<p>She tries to hit the ball as hard as she can every time up, and if it goes out of the park, all the better, she added.</p>
<p>So while she said the records and accomplishments are nice, she’s far more concerned with team goals. And after winning the conference title as a freshman, she has her sights set high again.</p>
<p>“I didn’t even know how many home runs I have hit, so I don’t think about it. I just wait for a good pitch and try to hit it,” she said. “It’s cool to have records, but it’s just really fun to win. We’ve been playing well, and hopefully we can keep on winning.”</p>
