<p>Muhlenberg (8-2) hosts the ECAC South Atlantic Bowl for the second straight year, welcoming a Salisbury (6-4) squad that was nationally ranked for most of the season.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.muhlenberg.edu/main/athletics/fall13/1122.html">preview</a> | <a href="http://www.muhlenberg.edu/sports/livestats/xlive.htm">live stats</a> | <a href="http://www.livestream.com/muhlenberg">live video</a></p>
<p><strong>Basketball at Washington College (Saturday, women at 2:00; men at 4:00)</strong></p>
<p>Both Muhlenberg teams are off to a hot start, with three wins and a Scotty Wood Tournament title under their belts. Although this is the third time in the last four years that both Mule squads started 3-0, it&#8217;s never happened that both started 4-0.</p>
<p>It also had never happened that both teams won a one-point game this early in the season, but the men edged Gwynedd Mercy, 81-80, in the Scotty Wood final, and the women outlasted Swarthmore, 75-74, in their overtime Centennial Conference opener.</p>
<p>This is the 21st time in the last 21 years that the Muhlenberg teams aren&#8217;t quite sure what to expect from their trip to Chestertown. Traditionally one of the hardest places in the CC for the Mules to play, the men won there last year but are only 5-16 at Washington since the start of CC play. The women have fared better, going 16-4, but it hasn&#8217;t been easy; two years ago, they <a href="http://www.muhlenberg.edu/main/athletics/winter12/0121.html">overcame a 17-point deficit</a> to win by three.</p>
<p>Both Washington teams are 0-2.</p>

			<p><em>Basketball shots &#8211; five from long range and one from very close range &#8211; from the Scotty Wood Tournament take this week&#8217;s honors.</em></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/stenger_three.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2110" alt="Abby Stenger" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/stenger_three.jpg" width="230" height="519" /></a>Female Play of the Week &#8211; Abby Stenger&#8217;s run of threes</strong></p>
<p>The Mule women&#8217;s basketball team had a 12-point lead cut to three earlier in the half, so when it went up 51-41 with 11 minutes left in the Scotty Wood championship game, there was still a chance that Misericordia would come back again. Stenger made sure that didn&#8217;t happen, drilling five straight three-pointers in a five-minute span. By the time her run was done, the Mules led by 23 (70-47) and were well on their way to the championship.</p>
<p>To say that the spurt came out of nowhere would be an understatement: Stenger missed her first seven shots from three-point range in the tournament, and the Mules and Cougars were a combined 0-for-9 from behind the arc before Stenger went off.</p>

<p><strong>Male Play of the Week &#8211; Malique Killing pass for Kevin Hargrove dunk</strong></p>
<p>Killing distinguished himself with his scoring during the Scotty Wood Tournament, netting 28 points &#8211; including the 1,000th of his career &#8211; in the championship game to earn MVP honors. But in the first-round game against Bryn Athyn, it was a pass he made that brought the loudest cheers.</p>
<p>With the Mules already leading 69-44, Killing rebounded a missed Lion three-pointer, dribbled the length of the court, spun in the lane and fed an open Hargrove for a dunk.</p>

			<p><em>Not much going on in Muhlenberg athletics this weekend &#8211; except for an eight-team basketball tournament, a rivalry football game, an NCAA cross country meet, a postseason soccer tournament and four wrestling matches. It&#8217;s one of the biggest weekends of the year!</em></p>
<p><strong>Basketball hosts Scotty Wood Tournament (Friday and Saturday, 1, 3, 6, and 8)</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/swtlogo_new.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2090" alt="Scotty Wood Tournament" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/swtlogo_new-300x230.jpg" width="300" height="230" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/swtlogo_new-300x230.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/swtlogo_new-390x300.jpg 390w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/swtlogo_new.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>The Scotty Wood Tournament tips off the Muhlenberg basketball season for the 32nd year. The Mule women open up against Rowan on Friday at 6:00, followed by the men against Bryn Athyn. Both Muhlenberg teams are trying to recapture the titles they won in 2011 after falling in the championship games last year.</p>

<p><strong>Cross Country hosts NCAA Mideast Regional (Saturday, women at 11:00, men at 12:30)</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/ncaaxcsquare.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2092" alt="NCAA cross country" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/ncaaxcsquare.jpg" width="203" height="211" /></a>Nearly 1,000 runners from 60 schools are scheduled to line up on Lehigh&#8217;s Goodman Campus in one of eight qualifier meets for the NCAA Championships (slated for next Saturday at Hanover, Ind.). Haverford has won the men&#8217;s meet the last three years, while Johns Hopkins brings in a streak of five straight regional championships.</p>
<p>The top two teams in each race automatically qualify for the NCAA Championships, and there are also 16 at-large berths available to fill out the 32-team national field. After the team bids have been determined, the top seven individuals in each region not on a qualifying team are selected to run in the national meet.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg, which is hosting the regional meet for the fourth time since 2001, has sent at least one runner to the NCAA Championships for the last eight seasons. Senior Nicki Cronin, who earned all-region honors by placing in the top 35 in both 2011 and 2012 and narrowly missed an NCAA berth last year, is the top candidate to continue that streak.</p>

<p><strong>Football vs. Moravian (Saturday, 1:00)</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/moraviantrophy.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2089" alt="football trophy" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/moraviantrophy.jpg" width="250" height="539" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/moraviantrophy.jpg 250w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/moraviantrophy-139x300.jpg 139w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px" /></a>In addition to all the reasons Moravian and Muhlenberg football players have anticipated this rivalry game for more than 50 years &#8211; local bragging rights, one last win for the seniors, etc. &#8211; there is now something else: A gleaming new trophy, donated by Sodexo, will go to the winner.</p>
<p>The Mules (7-2, 6-2) come in on a historic roll, having beaten five straight opponents by at least 20 points for the first time in program history. The Greyhounds (2-7, 2-6) are on a surge of their own, with two wins in their last three games following on 0-6 start.</p>
<p>Moravian has topped the 40-point mark three times in its last five games and boasts the top freshman runner and top rushing quarterback in the Centennial Conference. Muhlenberg has allowed only one offensive touchdown at home this season and ranks in the top 30 in Division III in scoring defense (20th), pass efficiency defense (24th), total defense (26th) and rushing defense (28th). The Mules have given up only three offensive touchdowns in their five-game winning streak.</p>
<p>Two Mule milestones are possible: Nick Palladino needs 141 yards to break the CC mark for passing yards by a freshman, and Cody Geyer needs 88 receiving yards to record the fourth 1,000-yard season in program history.</p>
<p>Moravian leads the all-time series, 33-26-2, but Muhlenberg has won eight of the last 11 meetings. The Mules have not allowed an offensive touchdown in taking the last two meetings.</p>

<p><strong>Men&#8217;s Soccer at Swarthmore (Saturday, 7:00)</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/ecacclr.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2091" alt="ECAC logo" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/ecacclr-300x93.jpg" width="300" height="93" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/ecacclr-300x93.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/ecacclr.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>The Mules (10-7-1) look to extend their season with an ECAC South semifinal game against CC rival Swarthmore (10-5-4). The winner faces the winners of the other semi between Frostburg State and Lebanon Valley in Sunday&#8217;s championship match.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg hasn&#8217;t beaten Swarthmore since 2007, but all the meetings since have been close: a scoreless tie, two 1-0 games and four 2-1 games. The last time the teams faced each other in the postseason was the 2010 CC championship game, a thriller that the Garnet won in double overtime.</p>
<p>The Mules went on to advance to the NCAA &#8220;Sweet 16&#8221; that year, which was the last time they won two postseason games in a season. Muhlenberg reached the ECAC championship game in both 1999 and 2000; its last ECAC title came in 1988.</p>

<p><strong>Wrestling at Penn Tech with Lafayette (Saturday, 12:00); at Scranton with Yeshiva (Sunday, 11:00)</strong></p>
<p>After winning a dual meet at Mount St. Vincent last weekend, the Mules will try to pick up some more wins. Muhlenberg outscored Scranton in contested bouts, 25-3, the last two years, but lost the matches due to forfeits. The Mules defeated Yeshiva, 24-15, when the teams last met in 2011.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Wow, did that really happen?&#8221; quipped senior CJ Graetzer as the elated Muhlenberg women&#8217;s soccer team filed onto the bus following its shootout win against McDaniel in the first round of the Centennial Conference playoffs on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Yes, it did happen. And it, or something like it, has happened before &#8211; about 17 times in the last 27 years.</p>
<p>Following is a list of Muhlenberg &#8220;Playoff Walkoffs&#8221; &#8211; postseason contests that were decided on the last play and enabled a Mule team to advance or win a championship. (We stretched the definition of &#8220;last play&#8221; slightly for the two basketball games.)</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/wsocbig_110513.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2065" alt="women's soccer 2013" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/wsocbig_110513.jpg" width="400" height="228" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/wsocbig_110513.jpg 400w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/wsocbig_110513-300x171.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></a>Women&#8217;s Soccer vs. McDaniel, 2013</strong></p>
<p>After a scoreless tie, the Mules won the penalty kick shootout, 4-3, to advance to the Centennial Conference semifinals. Amanda Wong stopped a Green Terror PK on the final play of the game.</p>

<p><strong>Men&#8217;s Basketball vs. Gettysburg, 2013</strong></p>
<p>Malique Killing hit a jumper from the top of the key with seven-tenths of a second remaining for a 45-43 win in a CC first-round game.</p>

<p>Alexandra Chili&#8217;s step-back three from the corner with one second left lifted the Mules to a 64-63 win in the first round of the NCAA Tournament. Muhlenberg went on to defeat Rochester the next day to advance to the &#8220;Sweet 16.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Men&#8217;s Soccer vs. Stevens, 2010</strong></p>
<p>Stevens was ranked 13th in Division III, owned a 34-match home unbeaten streak and had not lost in the NCAA Tournament (except on penalty kicks) since 2005 &#8211; until Josh Luginbuhl scored a &#8220;Golden Goal&#8221; with 3:21 left in double overtime to send Muhlenberg to the &#8220;Sweet 16&#8221; with a 2-1 win.</p>

<p><strong>Softball vs. Gettysburg, 2009</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg trailed 5-3 heading into the bottom of the seventh of this CC first-round playoff game. Four singles cut the deficit to one run, and then Samantha Crist hit a walkoff grand slam for an 8-5 win. It wound up winning the championship for the Mules, who were awarded the title as the highest remaining seed when the tournament was rained out the next day.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/kliewer.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2068" alt="Jonathan Kliewer" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/kliewer.jpg" width="216" height="238" /></a>Men&#8217;s Soccer vs. Franklin &amp; Marshall, 2004</strong></p>
<p>The Mules were 0-3 in overtime games for the season before Jonathan Kliewer, playing near his hometown of Ephrata, Pa., scored a &#8220;Golden Goal&#8221; 1:21 into extra time for a 1-0 win in the first round of the CC playoffs.</p>
<p><strong>Men&#8217;s Soccer vs. Gordon, 2003</strong></p>
<p>In the first round of the NCAA Tournament, Evan Smallwood converted a PK with five minutes left in regulation to tie the game at 2-2. After two scoreless overtime periods, Smallwood ended the shootout with another successful penalty.</p>
<p><strong>Softball vs. Merchant Marine, 2003</strong></p>
<p>Tied 5-5 after four innings, the Mules and Mariners battled through seven scoreless innings in this NCAA Tournament elimination game. Kristen Best finally ended the marathon game with a walkoff single in the bottom of the 12th.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/wsocecac1999.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2069" alt="women's soccer 1999" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/wsocecac1999.jpg" width="400" height="242" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/wsocecac1999.jpg 400w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/wsocecac1999-300x181.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></a>Women&#8217;s Soccer vs. Johns Hopkins, 1999</strong></p>
<p>Maybe the best career postseason walkoff in Muhlenberg history: Hilary Moses (No. 4 in the picture), a senior whose playing time had been limited by injuries, made the winning penalty kick in the ECAC championship game on the final play of her Mule career.</p>
<p><strong>Men&#8217;s Soccer vs. Messiah, 1995</strong></p>
<p>The latest into the postseason for a Muhlenberg walkoff; Todd Ervin&#8217;s &#8220;Golden Goal&#8221; in the 126th minute (overtimes were 15 minutes then, and teams played as many as four before going into PKs) on a frigid night gave the 10th-ranked Mules a 1-0 win against the third-ranked Falcons in an NCAA regional final. Muhlenberg defeated Ithaca the following weekend to advance to the &#8220;Final Four.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Men&#8217;s Soccer vs. Carnegie Mellon, 1994</strong></p>
<p>In an NCAA Tournament first-round game hosted by Muhlenberg, regulation play and overtime went on without a goal. Thomas Auchenbach made the 10th and final penalty kick to give the Mules a 3-2 win in the shootout and send them to the second round for the first time in program history.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/soft1991.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2070" alt="softball 1991" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/soft1991.jpg" width="300" height="341" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/soft1991.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/soft1991-263x300.jpg 263w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Softball, 1989-92</strong></p>
<p>The softball team made a habit of going to the postseason in the late &#8217;80s and early &#8217;90s, and they also made a habit of winning games in dramatic fashion. The Mules posted walkoff wins against Wilkes in the 1989 NCAA Tournament (on an RBI single by Laura Williams), Mount Union twice in the 1990 NCAA Tournament (RBI single by Val Verenna and three-run triple/error by Kim Lapple) and Franklin &amp; Marshall in the 1991 MAC playoffs (RBI grounder by Karen Brown). The pick of the group, however, was a walkoff single by freshman Tara Molloy in the bottom of the eighth for a 4-3 win against Elizabethtown in the 1992 MAC championship game.</p>
<p><strong>Men&#8217;s Soccer vs. Johns Hopkins, 1987</strong></p>
<p>Six years away from becoming fierce Centennial Conference rivals, Muhlenberg and Hopkins played a wild MAC South championship game. The Mules took leads of 2-1 and 3-2 in the first two overtime periods (which were not sudden death at the time), only to have the Blue Jays tie the score both times. Off to a shootout the match went. With the entire Muhlenberg football team (which was practicing on the adjacent field) looking on, Bert Mukkulainen completed a perfect Mule run through the round of five PKs by converting the winning shot after the fourth Hopkins shooter missed high.</p>

			<p><em><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/06/CSFathletes.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1807" alt="Ron Christian, Katy Mitton, Amanda Wong" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/06/CSFathletes.jpg" width="425" height="300" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/06/CSFathletes.jpg 425w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/06/CSFathletes-300x211.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 425px) 100vw, 425px" /></a>Earlier this month, three Muhlenberg athletes – rising seniors Amanda Wong (soccer) and Katy Mitton (basketball) and rising sophomore Ron “Big Ron” Christian (football) – participated in the NCAA Career in Sports Forum in Indianapolis.</em></p>
<p><em>The forum was an opportunity for NCAA athletes from all over the country and all three divisions to learn about the job opportunities in intercollegiate athletics. Some 700 athletes applied and only 277 were accepted into the four-day event.</em></p>
<p><em>Wong wrote about the experience:</em></p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">DAY ONE</span></b></p>
<p> The first half of the day was focused on values. Before the forum within our discussion teams, we had to fill out a survey about our own values. Through our values, we were able to identify what style of personality we are.</p>
<p>We were introduced to the DiSC test, which identified if we were <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">D</span></b>ominance, <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">I</span></b>nfluence, <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">S</span></b>teadiness or <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">C</span></b>onsciousness. Everyone carries all four styles, but usually there is one that is more dominant. Through the DiSC test, we were able to understand what are the other styles strengths and weaknesses along with how to work with them. From this test I was able to understand myself a lot more, and I plan on utilizing this test to my benefit when it comes to working with other people such as my teammates.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/06/CSF3.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1799" alt="Career in Sports Forum" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/06/CSF3.jpg" width="400" height="357" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/06/CSF3.jpg 400w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/06/CSF3-300x267.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/06/CSF3-336x300.jpg 336w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></a>The second half of the day, we listened to guest speaker DeNita L. Turner, President and CEO of Image Builders, Inc. She focused on the topic of branding yourself. This includes the importance of branding, how you carry yourself everywhere you go and how you represent yourself on social networking sites. Branding yourself creates your reputation and one slip up can easily lose you a job.</p>
<p>This portion was a wakeup call for most of the athletes, especially when it came to social networking sites. I think the most important advice DeNita said about the websites was  “if you are questioning whether or not you should keep something on your site, take it off.”</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">DAY TWO</span></b></p>
<p>Even though most of the athletes were exhausted from their early flights and long day from the day before, the energy was still high the next morning. Day Two was labelled “Big Picture of Intercollegiate Athletics.”</p>
<p>After our morning activities, we went off to our new set of color teams to experience the longest sitdown session of our lives. This session was focused on the ins and outs of the NCAA and where we can see ourselves based on our interests. </p>
<p>The session consisted of three rotations, and in each rotation we had different facilitators to learn more about their stories and experiences. This was a good chance for us to have the one-on-one attention from our facilitators to answer our questions and concerns about the different positions in the intercollegiate athletics.</p>
<p>Later that day we had another panel where we were able to find out other alternative careers in sports. There was Greg Pottorff, Attorney at Law; Julie Arnold, Director of NCAA Special Projects; Bruce Wimbish, Director of Marketing and Communications; and Charley Casserly, NFL Network analyst. This was the first time we had a perspective outside of administration and coaching where they gave us the insights about how to become involved with the NCAA in other positions.</p>
<p>They gave great advice about how we should always have a goal, how to build our resumes, how important work ethic is and why we should always take risks. I think my two favorite quotes from Charley Casserly were “the greatest investment you can make is with yourself” and “live cheap.”</p>
<p>After our long day of listening and working with one another, the forum awarded the athletes dinner at the NCAA Hall of Champions. It was like a big funhouse with a basketball court, virtual games and more. We were able to read up on the history of every sport and the NCAA. This was the place for us athletes to be competitive athletes and to act like kids on a playground.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/06/CSF1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1800" alt="Career in Sports Forum" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/06/CSF1.jpg" width="500" height="285" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/06/CSF1.jpg 500w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/06/CSF1-300x171.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">DAY THREE</span></b></p>
<p>Day Three was the hump day for most of the athletes. It was the day where we all had to dress business attire rather than business casual like the other days. Our emcee mentioned that today would be the most important day since we would be meeting more people who can help us with our future.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/06/CSF2.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1801" alt="Career in Sports Forum" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/06/CSF2.jpg" width="415" height="338" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/06/CSF2.jpg 415w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/06/CSF2-300x244.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/06/CSF2-368x300.jpg 368w" sizes="(max-width: 415px) 100vw, 415px" /></a>The forum focused on how we build our resumes and our “brand.” In our discussion teams, we were able to have others look at our resumes and receive feedback. The advice helped a lot, and luckily I was able to talk to Jill Redmond, Commissioner of the Atlantic 10 Conference, who gave me advice and even took my resume after I made my corrections. It’s funny how we can run into certain people and not realize they might be important figures in our future.</p>
<p>We also did mock interviews in our color teams to figure our strengths and weaknesses. It was interesting to see what our teammates picked up on about how ourselves.</p>
<p>We concluded the day with a Networking Dinner where the athletes were able to have the opportunity to have a sitdown dinner with two representatives of the NCAA. I am not going to lie, it was a little intimidating, but as the conversations took off, it became a productive night.  I enjoyed listening to many stories and have them answer our questions.</p>
<p>From all the stories I’ve heard, there seems to be a recurring pattern about work ethic and opportunities. If we work hard in anything we hope to achieve, the only person stopping us is ourselves. All doors are open and it is up to us if we take a step in. If it doesn’t work out, then we always have a choice to close the door behind us and walk into a new one.</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">DAY FOUR</span></b></p>
<p>The worst day finally arrived, the last day with very sad goodbyes. The final day was cut short to allow the athletes to catch their flights home. </p>
<p>After breakfast, the athletes and I had the honor to listen to Ann Gaffigan, Treasurer of the Track &amp; Field Athletes Association and the American record holder in the women’s steeplechase. She shared experiences with different job titles and making an impact on those she worked with. Ann mentioned how her values were tested and the challenges of being a woman in the sports industry.</p>
<p>In addition, we were even luckier for Ann to share her story about when she achieved the American record in the steeplechase. When all hope was lost and she had to fight through the pain, she challenged herself to be number one, and that she did. The whole room was hypnotized by her story, and I am sure every athlete in there was imaging their dreams coming true along with what they had to do to get there. Ann Gaffigan hands down was my favorite speaker during the whole forum, and I’m sure others will say the same. I encourage any athlete to research her story.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/06/csf4.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1804" alt="Career in Sports Forum" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/06/csf4.jpg" width="315" height="420" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/06/csf4.jpg 315w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/06/csf4-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 315px) 100vw, 315px" /></a>This experience will always be one of the highlights of my college athletic career. I could not be more grateful for the support from the Muhlenberg Athletic Department. I am also blessed to have the chance to share this experience with my two respectable Muhlenberg athletes, Katy and Big Ron.</p>
<p>I didn’t know what I was getting into, but I can honestly say I took out a lot more than I expected from those four days. I built friendships I plan on keeping for the rest of my life, I have more respect and interest in intercollegiate athletics after school, and I feel more prepared for what may come during my senior year. More importantly, I was able to reflect, discover, and appreciate who I am as a person.</p>
<p>I highly recommend this experience to anyone who is looking for answers or have any interest in pursuing a job with the NCAA. I will never forget or take this experience for granted. I would do it all over again and not change a thing.</p>

			<p><em>Profiles of senior Muhlenberg athletes are published in game programs in the sports of field hockey, football, soccer, volleyball, basketball, wrestling, baseball, softball, lacrosse and tennis, usually on that sport’s Senior Day.</em></p>
<p><em>As part of the Year in Review, here are some of the best responses in the Q&amp;A profiles from the winter and spring athletes.</em></p>
<p><strong>Matt O’Hara, Men&#8217;s Basketball</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you could trade places with anyone for a day, who would it be? </strong>Truthfully, in a completely non-weird way, I’d love to be on the girls’ basketball team. They have the best team chemistry at this school and some of my best friends are on that team: Julie Kelly, Alita Zabrecky and Kate Clawson, plus the whole sophomore class. They are a great team with great girls who have a ton of fun together.</p>

<p><strong>What was it like student teaching this past fall semester? </strong>Student teaching and playing basketball was an enjoyable hell. I would wake up every morning at six and hang out with a bunch of little prepubescent eighth graders. It was great because they would actually get my jokes and appreciate me acting like an idiot for their entertainment. After I was done yelling at those little whirling dervishes, and maybe teaching them a thing or two about the Mayan Empire, I would drive back to school, shove food down my throat and then get yelled at during practice. In the midst of all of this chaos, I would somehow do homework and sleep (sometimes during practice&#8230;) and I eventually became a master of the chaos. The worst part about all of this running around was that I loved every second of my time being Mr. Lags.</p>
<p><strong>Alita Zabrecky, Women&#8217;s Basketball</strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s the most memorable game of your Muhlenberg career? </strong>My most memorable game was, by far, my freshman year at Gettysburg. For some reason Coach had both Kate Clawson and I on the floor late in the game, down by one, with just seconds to go. We had the ball on the sideline out of bounds and our play was designed to get either Kelly [McKeon] or Alex [Chili] the ball so they could shoot, but they were not able to get open so by default, they had to pass to me. I started dribbling toward the basket and the next thing I know I am dribbling the ball off of my foot, thankfully right in the direction of Kate who snatched it up off of the floor. Once Kate had secured the ball I figured my best bet was just to stay out of the way and run to the basket to grab a rebound if someone missed a shot. After almost turning the ball over, I figured I probably should not be taking the last shot of the game. Kate now throws the ball into Sheila Cook in the post, and as I am making my way to the basket, Sheila throws the ball to me, assuming I am making a cut and that I wanted the ball (which I did not). It bounced off my chest, and I caught it and laid it in for the game-winning bucket. This play was by far the most dysfunctional game-winning play I have ever been a part of. I am just thankful that I made the layup given my track record of missed layups.</p>
<p><strong>Ted Albanese, Men&#8217;s Lacrosse</strong></p>
<p><strong>How did you get started playing lacrosse? </strong>I started playing lacrosse when I was 10 years old and in fourth grade. My career conveniently started when my baseball career ended (I didn&#8217;t make the travel team). It&#8217;s a funny story actually. The night I found out I didn&#8217;t make the baseball team, I also found out my pet hermit crab died, so that was a rough night.</p>

<p align="left"><strong>What was it like playing with your brother at Muhlenberg? </strong>Since I was born, my brother was always right there at my side &#8230; By the time I was a senior in high school, &#8230; the only one I had in mind was Muhlenberg so I could play with my brother. When spring of my freshman year finally came, it felt like Christmas came early. As the team hit the field for the first time, I just saw my brother and I walking out to the backyard to have a catch. When lined up to guard him in practice, he’ll say he got the best of my every time, but he doesn’t want to admit his little brother came in as a freshman and put him on an island day in and day out. It was one thing to practice together, but to play in the games with each other made it even more special. Hearing, &#8220;Carpetto brothers you’re next on defense&#8221; was something that gave me chills every game.</p>
<p><strong>Jack Reilly, Men&#8217;s Lacrosse</strong></p>
<p align="left"><strong>What’s one possession you couldn’t live without? </strong>The possession I can’t live without is the bond and relationships I have developed with my teammates. This outweighs any material possession I own and is something that will last a lifetime.</p>
<p><strong>Angie Sisco, Softball</strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s one thing on your bucket list? </strong>To go to the Everglades and finally see and/or wrestle an alligator … I’d be okay with either.</p>

<p><strong>Describe Coach DeStasio in one word. </strong>I would describe Coach DeStasio as a “non-hugger.” This year we divided our team into “huggers” and the “touch me and die” group, otherwise known as “non-huggers.” Having grown up with the president of the “huggers,” Angie Sisco, I am definitely part of the “non-hugging” group and it’s great to have a coach that shares my views on this matter.</p>
<p><strong>Jessica Klein, Women&#8217;s Tennis</strong></p>
<p><strong>What off-the-court accomplishment are you most proud of? </strong>One off-the-court accomplishment I am proud of is getting into Muhlenberg. I worked hard to get here, and it has been a remarkable journey that I am so privileged to have had.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/05/vontaube_yir.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1779" title="Amanda von Taube" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/05/vontaube_yir.jpg" alt="" width="228" height="350" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/05/vontaube_yir.jpg 228w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/05/vontaube_yir-195x300.jpg 195w" sizes="(max-width: 228px) 100vw, 228px" /></a>Amanda von Taube, Women&#8217;s Tennis</strong></p>
<p><strong>This is your second year as team captain. What has been the most rewarding part of leading the team for two years? </strong>The most rewarding part of being captain is being able to see all of my fellow teammates grow not only as tennis players, but as people – on and off the court. On the court especially, I have seen so many of my fellow teammates get more and more confident in their games and play some truly amazing tennis. Every one of them motivates me to be a better tennis player and even though I am captain, I think I look up to them for all that they do and their tennis skills. We spend so much time together during the season and I feel really lucky to have met such a smart, fun, loving group of girls … I am so honored to hold this position for my team.</p>
<p><strong>Alexandra Franck, Women&#8217;s Lacrosse</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do you have any pregame rituals or superstitions? </strong>My teammates will call me the most superstitious person on the team, and I’d have to agree. I’ve been wearing the same bow in my hair for game day throughout my four years here. I have two main rituals &#8211; one is taking a shower before every game. I started doing this my freshman year and when I started having success on the field, I knew I had to keep it. It’s a way of thinking about the game and what I want to accomplish. The second ritual also started my freshman year &#8211; a senior at the time (Alyssa Bascelli) told me about her pregame ritual of eating a pint of Ben &amp; Jerry’s ice cream the night before every game. She informed us that someone had to do it with her so that when she graduated, it would get passed down. I was the willing (and maybe not so intelligent) freshman who said, “Sure!” and proceeded to eat a pint of Ben &amp; Jerry’s Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough ice cream the night before every game. I have for all four years and now that I am graduating, I have passed the ritual down to freshmen Rachel Pedersen and Casey Armstrong. You guys better not disappoint me!</p>

<p><strong>Your middle name, Zoe, is pretty unique. Were you named after someone? </strong>I am named after my Greek grandmother (my Yiayia) whose name was Bessie Zoe Athanasiou. Zoe means “life” in Greek and was the perfect portrayal of my Yiayia who is sadly no longer with us. We also both had only one dimple on our left cheeks. This was something we shared and something she always loved about the two of us. I am honored to be named after my Yiayia, and her spirit lives on and will continue to live on through me as I share her name.  </p>

<p><strong>What’s it like having six siblings? Are you the youngest, oldest or in the middle? </strong>I am the third oldest of seven. My brother, Joey, is the oldest, then I have one older sister, Kelly, and four younger sisters, Erin, Mary Kate, Maggie and Tara. People generally feel sorry for my brother for being the only boy, but they shouldn’t because he is treated like a king (and acts like it). The biggest issue with having six siblings, and especially five sisters, is that you cannot leave any personal items unattended, especially clothing, because you will never get it back.</p>

<p><strong>Do you have any pregame rituals or superstitions? </strong>I have way too many superstitions and rituals to even name them all – from the way I put on my cleats to the made-up gibberish language our catcher Brett Rosen and I use to communicate before I pitch. The most meaningful and consistent ritual I have revolves around the word “trust.” The importance of this word was instilled in me by my high school coach. Before the inning begins he would tell me to clear off the mound and envision the word trust printed on the rubber. This year I printed it on the brim of my hat. It has served as my anchor, allowing me to take all the emotion out of the situation and focus on doing my job for our team.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/05/velys_yir.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1781" title="Tim Velys" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/05/velys_yir.jpg" alt="" width="186" height="350" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/05/velys_yir.jpg 186w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/05/velys_yir-159x300.jpg 159w" sizes="(max-width: 186px) 100vw, 186px" /></a>Tim Velys, Baseball</strong></p>
<p><strong>How is it being teammates with Ryan Rechten? </strong>As a player, Ryan is one of the more loose and goofy kids on the team – he always has something ridiculous to say. The best part about this is that it makes everyone around him relaxed and reminds us that baseball is just a game and that we must treat it that way if we want to be successful. What I commend him for is his ability to joke around and have fun in the bullpen for six innings of the game and then turn it on right around the sixth knowing that it is his job to come in late and shut the door against the opposing team. I couldn’t think of a better person to have in this role as I have all the confidence in the world that he will come in and get outs in a hurry.</p>
<p><strong>Rob Shannon, Baseball</strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s it like having nine older siblings? </strong>Having nine older siblings is the most incredible thing in my life. It is something that I truly treasure. I am so blessed to have them because they have truly made me into the person I am today. They mean more to me than words can capture. I wear the number nine to represent them.</p>
<p><strong>Robert Appleby, Baseball</strong></p>
<p><strong>How did you get started playing baseball and what’s your first memory of playing?</strong>I’m not really sure how I got started but when I did start playing at the age of 4, I was instantly obsessed. My first memory of actually playing baseball was my first year of tee ball. The league rules were that there were no outs and each team got to hit through the lineup every inning. I remember being at shortstop when this kid hit a line drive to me, which I caught and doubled off the runner at first base. Even though I made the play, he still got to stay on base. I remember how excited I was when I was old enough to play in the league where you could actually get people out. As a hitter now, I take back ever thinking that.</p>

			<p>Members of the Muhlenberg men’s and women’s basketball teams stepped onto the court last Wednesday as they have hundreds of times in their careers. This time, however, it wasn’t with the goal of defeating an opponent – it was to run a practice for <a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/04/clawson.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1707" title="Kate Clawson" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/04/clawson-237x300.jpg" alt="Kate Clawson" width="237" height="300" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/04/clawson-237x300.jpg 237w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/04/clawson-812x1024.jpg 812w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/04/clawson.jpg 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 237px) 100vw, 237px" /></a>their favorite sport with Special Olympics athletes from the Lehigh Valley.</p>
<p>This is the second year in a row that the team has participated in the event, which is held at Trexler Middle School.</p>
<p>“The Student Athletic Advisory Committee (SAAC) wanted to do more stuff with the Special Olympics this year,” said senior Kate Clawson, who is a committee member. “We helped them organize the Lehigh Valley Polar Bear Plunge and wanted to continue our involvement with the organization.”</p>
<p>The Polar Bear Plunge, held in January, benefitted Special Olympics Pennsylvania, and many of the organization’s members participated in it.</p>
<p>Clawson, who interned for Special Olympics in her home state of Connecticut last summer, helped plan the basketball practice, and at the same time, got to be an active participant.</p>
<p>The players started off by leading the Special Olympics athletes through a series of <a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/04/drills.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1713" title="Warmup Drills" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/04/drills-300x149.jpg" alt="Austin Curry" width="300" height="149" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/04/drills-300x149.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/04/drills-1024x509.jpg 1024w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/04/drills-500x248.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>warmups. Once they were ready to go, the athletes participated in a defensive stance drill where they had to smack the floor and get into position before shuffling left and right.</p>
<p>Fullcourt layups (righty and lefty!) were next, followed by three different work stations.</p>
<p>At one station, Clawson, juniors Austin Curry and Kevin Hargrove and sophomore <a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/04/girls.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1715" title="Special Olympics Athletes" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/04/girls-239x300.jpg" alt="Special Olympics" width="239" height="300" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/04/girls-239x300.jpg 239w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/04/girls-816x1024.jpg 816w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/04/girls.jpg 1416w" sizes="(max-width: 239px) 100vw, 239px" /></a>Hannah Rush instructed the athletes on how to defend the dribble. At another, sophomores Abby Stenger and Malique Killing and freshmen Nick Melosky and Ryan Marchetti ran the athletes through series of ballhandling and dribbling drills. At the third station, senior Julie Kelly, sophomores Nicole Pepe and Jesse Lerner and freshman Alec Stavetski helped the players shoot from different spots on the floor.</p>
<p>At the end of the evening, men’s assistant coach Marqus Hunter gave away Muhlenberg bracelets to the athletes who correctly answered various basketball trivia questions. But they didn’t just have to answer the questions correctly, they had to make a shot before receiving their prize!</p>
<p>“The best part is just getting to come hang out with these athletes” added Clawson. “It’s so nice to work with them – they’re just so happy doing the little things. It really makes you appreciate your life and what you have.<a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/04/group-photo.jpg"><img class="alignright size-large wp-image-1708" title="Muhlenberg Basketball &amp; Special Olympics Athletes" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/04/group-photo-1024x382.jpg" alt="Special Olympics" width="584" height="217" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/04/group-photo-1024x382.jpg 1024w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/04/group-photo-300x112.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/04/group-photo-500x186.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 584px) 100vw, 584px" /></a></p>

			<p>Four years ago, the women’s basketball team took a trip to New York City to see a broadway show called <em>Hair. </em>And little did we know, a tradition would be born. Over the past four years, the seniors have also seen <em>Billy Elliot</em>, <em>Memphis</em>, and then, most recently, <em>The Phantom of the Opera. </em></p>
<p><em>The Phantom of the Opera </em>is a classic love story and is the longest running show in the history of Broadway. Set in France, the play features a “ghost” who <a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/01/phantom.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1622" title="The Phantom of the Opera" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/01/phantom.jpg" alt="" width="215" height="312" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/01/phantom.jpg 215w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/01/phantom-206x300.jpg 206w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /></a>torments an opera house. This ghost is actually a man who wears a mask to cover his disfiguration, and who also happens to be a very talented singer. He secretly takes a young girl named Christine under his wing, teaching her how to sing beautiful opera music. The phantom demands that she be given the lead roles in the various operas that are performed, otherwise he will make terrible things happen to the cast members. Over time, the masked phantom ends up developing feelings for her. But Christine rekindles a relationship with a man she knew as a child named Raoul, and the two fall in love, leaving the phantom desperate and alone, as he has felt his entire life. He proceeds to kidnap Christine and try and convince her to be with him instead (not exactly the most romantic gesture). She is forced to choose between the two men, but ultimately the decision is not up to her.</p>
<p><em>The Phantom of the Opera </em>is a story of love, loss, and twisted fate. The voices of the cast are very impressive, and the music is quite catchy. But despite those two positive features, I have to say, I think it’s pretty overrated. No offense to any of you <em>Phantom </em>lovers out there, but I just didn’t find the story to be convincing. The phantom and Christine never even share a nice conversation and the audience is supposed to believe that he truly loves her. I think I loved the cupcake I had before the show more than he loved Christine.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/01/hair_broadway1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1624 alignleft" title="Hair" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/01/hair_broadway1-300x206.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="206" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/01/hair_broadway1-300x206.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/01/hair_broadway1-435x300.jpg 435w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/01/hair_broadway1.jpg 580w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>I asked my fellow classmates, Alita Zabrecky and Kate Clawson, what their favorite play we had seen over the past four years was. Alita and I both agreed that the best was <em>Hair</em>, a musical about the youth counterculture of the 1960s, which featured awesome music and long-haired hippies dancing around in the audience. At the end of the show, they invited anyone to come down and dance on the stage. So naturally, I ran down with a <a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/01/memphis_broadway.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1627" title="Memphis" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/01/memphis_broadway-240x300.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="300" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/01/memphis_broadway-240x300.jpg 240w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/01/memphis_broadway.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px" /></a>few of my teammates and we danced around with the cast members. It was amazing. Kate’s favorite was <em>Memphis</em> &#8211; the play we saw last year. That was about the first white DJ to play soul music by African American artists in the 1950s. I have to say, that one was pretty great too.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that <em>Phantom of the Opera </em>wasn’t the best play I’ve ever seen, we still had a great time in New York. We had dinner and a few of us walked around a bit before the show began, stopping at a little bakery called Baked By Melissa. It had bite-sized cupcakes in all different flavors &#8211; a perfect little treat. Going into the city to see a show is a great opportunity for all of us to do something fun together. And since we come back to school so much earlier than the rest of the students, it’s nice to have a little trip to look forward as a way of spicing up our sweatsuit-clad lives.</p>
<p>I think special events like this is a way of bringing our team even closer than we already are. We are so much more than a team, and it definitely translates on the basketball court. Communication is crucial for success in games, and we certainly get <a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/01/mules-on-broadway-2013.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1620" title="Muhlenberg women's basketball" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/01/mules-on-broadway-2013-300x268.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="268" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/01/mules-on-broadway-2013-300x268.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/01/mules-on-broadway-2013-335x300.jpg 335w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/01/mules-on-broadway-2013.jpg 612w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>plenty of practice talking to each other on a day-to-day basis. I couldn’t ask for a better group of girls to call my teammates. We all get along so well, and it’s really a testament to Coach Rohn. Our friendships and memories with eachother are more important than the game of basketball, but I do think that is why we have achieved so much success as a team over the past years. The yearly trip to see a Broadway show may be a new tradition, but the bond that exists between players on the Muhlenberg women’s basketball team is far more long-standing.</p>

			<p>Every January, in honor of Martin Luther King Day, the Muhlenberg men’s and women’s basketball teams take a short drive to Jefferson Elementary School in downtown Allentown to participate in the “Dream To Read” program.</p>
<p>The event is organized by the Volunteer Center of the Lehigh Valley with the cooperation of Muhlenberg and the elementary school. Each year the children receive t-shirts to commemorate the event.</p>
<p><em>more on Dream to Read:</em> <a title="Dream to Read photo gallery" href="http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10151332750428221.492174.103031738220" target="_blank">photo gallery </a>| <a title="Dream to Read video" href="http://youtu.be/hdIrsUbLS2c" target="_blank">Service Electric TV2 video</a></p>
<p>For the first half of the event, the players read a book to the children, who ranged in age from first to third grade. The book was about the life and work of Dr. Martin Luther King, and during and after the story, they asked the youngsters questions about civil rights and racial issues.</p>
<p>“With first graders, difficult topics like segregation and racism aren’t things that they face on a daily basis, but that they will be faced with in the future,” said junior Erin Laney, an American studies major who will graduate with a certification to teach fourth through eighth grade. “It’s hard to introduce those topics without them having prior knowledge.”</p>
<p>Laney felt that her background in education helped with getting the youngsters to raise questions about the issues.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/01/laney_dreamtoread.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1616" title="Erin Laney" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/01/laney_dreamtoread.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="399" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/01/laney_dreamtoread.jpg 600w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/01/laney_dreamtoread-300x199.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/01/laney_dreamtoread-451x300.jpg 451w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p>“First-graders are so fun,” she said of working with a younger age group than that for which she will be certified to teach. “You can joke around with them and laugh, and it’s really carefree in the classroom.”</p>
<p>After the reading sessions, the players asked the children to think about and envision their own dreams. The children then gathered around their desks to draw their dreams while the players talked to them and had them explain their drawings.</p>
<p>“It’s a chance for us to come and get a laugh and give back to the community,” added Laney. “Jefferson Elementary and Muhlenberg have always had a great connection and we see these kids a lot between the Jefferson Field Day and other events that occur on campus.</p>
<p>“It’s great to have that connection and do something other than basketball during the two weeks we’re here before classes start.”</p>

			<p><em>It wasn&#8217;t hard to pick the sport for the Muhlenberg&#8217;s athletes of the month: The basketball teams were the only ones to compete in December! But picking the athletes was more challenging, as both teams had good records for the month (the women 5-1 and the men 4-2) and plenty of good performances.</em></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/01/zabreckyhs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1610" title="Alita Zabrecky" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/01/zabreckyhs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Female Athlete of the Month &#8211; Alita Zabrecky, Basketball</strong></p>
<p>Zabrecky averaged 13.7 points in six games &#8211; exactly what she needed to reach the 1,000-point milestone. She became the ninth Mule in the 1,000-point club by hitting a three-pointer in the first half of a 52-point win at Misericordia. Zabrecky also averaged 9.3 rebounds and 2.5 assists for the month and will head into Saturday&#8217;s home game against McDaniel as the only player in the Centennial Conference who ranks in the top 10 in scoring, rebounding and assists.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/01/killinghs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1609" title="Malique Killing" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/01/killinghs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Male Athlete of the Month &#8211; Malique Killing, Basketball</strong></p>
<p>Killing scored 38 points in the final game of November but <em>increased</em> his scoring average in December, averaging 20.8 points in six games. He shot .452 from the field and .786 from the foul line while averaging 3.5 assists and 2.7 steals per game. Killing hit the game-winning shot (<a title="game-winning shot at Dickinson" href="http://youtu.be/0Uu_VnTKjgs">a three-pointer with 27.4 seconds left</a>) in a key win at Dickinson and notched his third career 30-point game at Johns Hopkins. He is in the top 10 in the CC in scoring (second), steals (third) and assists (sixth).</p>
