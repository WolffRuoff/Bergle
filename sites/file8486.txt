								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As online social networking sites are expanding their popularity, a phenomenon termed “Facebook envy” seems to be on the rise (Appel, 2015). The frustration of logging on to Facebook and being flooded with endless pictures, status updates and friends’ notifications showing what seems to be their perfect lives is one way to describe Facebook envy. This problem has been faced by all Facebook users since 2006 yet still, there is very few research investigating how envy can lead to many other very real physiological effects. Envy and jealousy go hand and hand with depression, yet little is known about the mechanisms underlying this connection. In the “Journal of Social &amp; Clinical Psychology, Vol. 34” a quasi-experimental study entitled, “Social Comparison, Envy, and Depression on Facebook” discusses how Facebook is a high-risk environment for depressed individuals and investigates the severity to which envy harms Facebooks 1 billion users.</p>
<p>In this study, depressed and non-depressed individuals were asked to describe their current levels of self-esteem and were then assigned and compared to a specific Facebook profile. These profiles were either attractive or unattractive and each participant compared themselves to the owner of the profile they were assigned and they reported their resulting feelings. I am sure each feeling was different than the other, yet feelings of envy were the most popular among all test subjects. The original hypothesis for this experiment was that the depressed individuals were expected to feel inferior and more envious, particularly when paired up with an attractive Facebook profile (Appel, 2015). The experiment was also expected to demonstrate how envy can be correlated with low self-esteem, and depressiveness in social comparison.</p>
<p>Social comparison on Facebook is an ongoing process that appears to be the major cause in online envy. This is all a result of Facebooks impression management which allows its users to select, edit and post pictures that misrepresent the truth behind each user’s life (Appel, 2015). This study does a fantastic job in showing how envy is created and why it is harmful. The results were written down, participants were compared to one another and it turns out that resulting envy was higher after seeing an attractive profile. Also, among depressed participants the jealousy experienced was higher than any other. Both results yielded p-values well below zero which gives us strong evidence to conclude that when depressed individuals meet Facebooks misrepresented profiles, the result is in fact envy.</p>
<p>We know by now that Facebook’s boastful atmosphere makes it a very hostile environment for depressed individuals (Appel, 2015).  The results of this experiment shed a new light on the mechanisms underlying the connection between depression and Facebook envy. With this new information, Facebook and many other social networks alike should realize the dangers their users face on a daily basis. Since online social media are already a part of most people’s lives today, interventions must take place soon in order to silence the dangers surrounding the media.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Instagram is one of the most popular forms of social media that exists. The platform of this specific social media focuses solely on the posting of pictures with different filters and captions which are seen by a user’s followers who are able to like and comment on the posted photo. Although Instagram has a lot of positive aspects such as allowing people to be connected to family, friends, and strangers around the world, there are still numerous adverse effects that make the app not as advantageous as it is intended to be. In the article “The Instagram Effect: How the Psychology of Envy Drives Consumerism,” author, Lane Anderson lays out on the table all of the destructive consequences that stem from the thriving site. Anderson categorizes the most prominent aspects as “peer pressure,” “reality check,” and most importantly, “comparison.” Comparison is by far the most emphasized point in this article. Anderson interviewed multiple people and quoted them throughout the article and without fail, each person mentioned something about the envy that is typically instilled in majority of Instagram’s users.</p>
<p>A quote that embodies the overall message of this article was said by Andrea Mouritsen, a well-known blogger turned Instagrammer. In regards to “famous” bloggers receiving free gifts just because they are well-known on the Internet, Mouritsen said, “There are photos of (a popular blogger) pushing a $1,800 stroller while a professional photographer follows them. Suddenly, I feel like my stroller is a piece of crap, and it puts me in a state of annoyance.” This quote is so vital to relaying the author’s message because it shows how Instagram is being misused. Instagram is supposed to make the users feel unified with the people that they follow; whether people are following their friends, family, or a superstar, everyone is on the same level. However, when situations like the one above occur users are no longer on the same level. Instead, people are driven apart and it is often a person’s own fault for allowing this to happen.</p>
<p>This is not to say that comparison is always an awful thing. Sometimes it can be a constructive component that people utilize in order to better him- or herself or life. Comparison changes sides when people allow it to morph into envy and allow it to affect their life.</p>
