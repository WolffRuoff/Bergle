<p>Mayden won both the mile and the 1000 meters &#8211; two races that started less than an hour apart &#8211; at the Lafayette-Rider Games. Her mile time of 5:02.63 (converted) is the second-fastest in the CC and the 15th-fastest in Division III this year. Her time in the 1,000 (2:58.69) broke the former school record – held by a three-time NCAA qualifier – by almost nine seconds.  </p>

<div>Rice was part of two first-place finishes at the Lafayette-Rider Games, winning the 400 and anchoring the 4&#215;400. His time in the 400 (49.56) is the best in the CC this season, and he helped the relay team break an eight-year-old school record. Rice is now part of five school-record relay teams.</div>

<p><strong>Track &amp; Field at Lafayette-Rider Games (Friday, 1:00)</strong></p>
<p>The Mule teams compete at the Armory in their last big meet before the Centennial Conference Championships in two weeks. The track in Manhattan has been very good to the Muhlenberg runners, particularly senior Peter Rice, who broke the school record in the 200 and 400 at this meet last year. He then returned to the Armory eight days later and broke the 400 record again, hitting the NCAA qualifying standard.</p>
<p>Results: <a href="http://www.armorytrack.com/">http://www.armorytrack.com/</a></p>
<p><strong>Basketball doubleheader vs. McDaniel (Saturday, women at 2:00, men at 4:00)</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s rare that individual accomplishments would be put ahead of team goals in basketball, but Alexandra Chili and Spencer Liddic are two rare student-athletes. Unless the Mules qualify to host playoff games, this will be the last time they play at Memorial Hall.</p>
<p>Both have had incredible careers on and off the court. Both were preseason All-Americans and are Centennial Conference all-time leaders in a major statistical category (Chili in three-pointers, Liddic in rebounds). Chili is the all-time leading scorer in Muhlenberg basketball history (men or women); Liddic is likely to move into fourth place tomorrow:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Alexandra Chili, 2009-12 &#8211; 1865 points</strong></li>
<li>Bob McClure, 1968-71 &#8211; 1788 points</li>
<li>Felicia Perryman, 1990-93 &#8211; 1690 points</li>
<li>Dennis Adams, 1991-94 &#8211; 1638 points</li>
<li><strong>Spencer Liddic, 2009-12 &#8211; 1631 points</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Both also were named to the Academic All-District first team recently and are candidates for Academic All-America honors. It is quite remarkable for two student-athletes like this to be at the same school, playing the same sport and in the same class year.</p>
<p>As for the games, both are key for Mule teams in search of playoff berths with three games remaining in the regular season.</p>
<p>The women (17-5, 12-5) are tied for third in the CC and can clinch a playoff spot with a win. They beat McDaniel 77-64 in the first meeting. Although the Green Terror is a little down this year (10-13, 7-11) it is coming off a 76-74 upset of first-place Johns Hopkins and has a history of spoiling Muhlenberg&#8217;s parties, winning three CC playoff games at Memorial Hall in the last 11 years.</p>
<p>The men (14-8, 8-7) are in sole possession of fifth place in a tightly packed CC. Johns Hopkins and Washington are both a game ahead, Haverford and Ursinus (next week&#8217;s opponents for the Mules)both a game back. Muhlenberg came back from an eight-point deficit in the final two minutes to pull out a 71-70 win at McDaniel in January. The Green Terror (7-15, 4-11), which is nationally ranked in scoring defense, has won only two of its last 20 games in Allentown.</p>

			<p><em><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/02/pricehs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-792" title="Alex Price" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/02/pricehs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/02/nortonhs.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-791" title="Renee Norton" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/02/nortonhs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Since there isn’t enough analysis of the Super Bowl in the two weeks leading up to the game, we asked two Muhlenberg senior athletes &#8211; track runner Alex Price (from Westborough, Mass.) and field hockey player Renee Norton (from Lincoln Park, N.J.) – to break down the matchup. What teams do you think they’re rooting for?</em></p>
<p><strong>How far do you live from your team’s home stadium?</strong></p>
<p>AP: Westborough is about 45 minutes up 495 from Gillette Stadium.</p>
<p>RN: I live just about 15 minutes from the stadium. It&#8217;s a very easy ride to get there. I&#8217;ve been there for not only games, but for concerts and fairs as well.</p>
<p><strong>How many games have you gone to?</strong></p>
<p>AP: I’ve been to a decent amount over the years, hard to get tickets. The most notable game I’ve been to was the Snow-Bowl/Tuck-Rule Game against the Raiders back in 2002. Between being the last game at the old Foxboro Stadium and part of the Pats’ first championship, I’ll never forget it.</p>
<p>RN: I would say I&#8217;ve been to about three games in my life. I think I went to a few preseason games when I was younger with my family, and this year I went to the Giants vs. Dolphins game. I will definitely be going to more games in years to come because my parents became season ticket holders this year. However, it is hard to compete with my three brothers and parents for games to go to considering they are all diehard fans also.</p>
<p><strong>On a scale of 1 to 10, how big of a fan are you?</strong></p>
<p>AP: 12, the number of Tom Brady. One of the superstitions I’ve had since the Patriots’ Super Bowl run back in 2004 is that I only wash my jersey after a loss. So, since the Patriots have won 10 games in a row, it’s going on almost three months now. Smells like victory.</p>
<p>RN: Ummmmmm, 10!!! My whole life I’ve been a Giants fans. I was brought up with the game of football being a huge part of my life. All three of my brothers played football, my father was a football player, my uncles were football players &#8230; I even wanted to play little league football, but my dad wouldn&#8217;t let me (it&#8217;s hard not to be a &#8220;tomboy&#8221; when I grew up with mostly guys). My grandfather, my dad&#8217;s dad, was actually a diehard Giants fan since the 1930s as well. I own four Giants jersey. I got a Plaxico Burress jersey the year of their Super Bowl win in 2007, and quickly hid it in my closet shortly after his incident that sent him to jail. I then got my Ahmad Bradshaw jersey. My family&#8217;s Christmas card last year was a picture of me and my three brothers with our Giants jerseys on. Last season I got a Kevin Boss jersey, after the season. Of course he was then traded so it was a waste. Lastly, this season I got a Victor Cruz jersey, and I can&#8217;t be more excited about that. I will be wearing his jersey for the Super Bowl. </p>
<p><strong>Who is your favorite player?</strong></p>
<p>AP: Definitely the big man, Vincent Lamar Wilfork. He had a monstrous game against the Ravens two weeks ago and you can bet he’ll be hungry this weekend.</p>
<p>RN: Through the years, we have all had our favorite players, sometimes from different teams. I would say that Victor Cruz has become my new favorite Giants player. I remember thinking to myself after he made his first touchdown early this season that I would love this guy. He&#8217;s a phenomenal receiver. He&#8217;s quick, he&#8217;s agile, he&#8217;s firy, he&#8217;s electric, he&#8217;s a HUGE game-changer … He&#8217;s everything you would want in a player.  And he&#8217;s from Paterson which is like five minutes from where I live.  All I gotta say is CRUZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZz!!!</p>
<p><strong>What did you think of the Giants-Patriots Super Bowl two years ago?</strong></p>
<p>AP: It was a tough, tough game. But that was a different team with a lot of aging players, especially on defense. And don’t get me started on Belichick wearing a red sweatshirt for that game. He ALWAYS wears gray, occasionally navy blue. Luckily, sources have confirmed that Bill won’t be wearing red this time around.</p>
<p>RN: That was a PHENOMENAL game. It was sooooo exciting! It was my mom, my dad, and me watching it at my home. I remember being scared once they were down and rushing to get that touchdown. All of a sudden &#8230; &#8220;THE CATCH!&#8221; Eli Manning to David Tyree &#8230; how did he hold on to that ball? I still don&#8217;t get it! But it was so amazing. Then the touchdown to Burress. I got the chills immediately. We were going insaneeeeee in my house! Yelling &#8230; laughing &#8230; high-fiving! What a great memory, thanks to the Giants.</p>
<p><strong>What or who do you like least about the other team?</strong></p>
<p>AP: Eli Manning. He’s always going to be the “other Manning” whether or not Peyton plays again or not. Don’t get me wrong, the Giants have some very talented players on their roster, but it’s hard to take them seriously with Eli at the helm.</p>
<p>RN: Bill Belichick and that ATROCIOUS sweatshirt. Who cuts the sleeves off their sweatshirts? It is just awful looking. Also, I know it&#8217;s hard to hate Tom Brady because he is awesome, but he is not the Giants quarterback. That&#8217;s enough reason right there not to like him. Also, Brady is a little embarrassing too. This is evident if you click on this link: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGF4l3hcgBg">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGF4l3hcgBg</a></p>
<p><strong>Are you doing anything special for the game?</strong></p>
<p>AP: Probably going to be watching with a whole lot of Giants fans and hopefully a few of us on the New England side too. Weeks ago we could all see this matchup coming, and campus is definitely going to be exciting on Sunday.</p>
<p>RN: I will be going home for the game to watch it with my whole family. It will be my mom, my dad, my three brothers, my brother&#8217;s fiance and my boyfriend. We will be making football cookies and blue-chocolate covered pretzels and all will be wearing BLUE!</p>
<p><strong>Who wins and what&#8217;s the score?</strong></p>
<p>AP: Everyone knows what our offense can do. It’s definitely going to come down to our defense and this time around we have a young crew between Mayo, Chung, Spikes, and others who won’t be getting tired at the end. Patriots get their revenge, 24-23.</p>
<p>RN: Giants 28-21. It should be a close game but I believe in the Giants to pull through.</p>

			<p>As the end of the season draws closer, the contests grow bigger in importance. And that&#8217;s certainly the case this weekend, with only 15 days left in the regular season.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-104" title="Mule Marquee Matchup" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="237" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg 350w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1-300x203.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" /></a>Men&#8217;s Basketball vs. Franklin &amp; Marshall (Saturday, 4:00)</strong></p>
<p>Franklin &amp; Marshall is 19-1, ranked eighth in Division III and closing in on the top seed for the Centennial Conference playoffs. Muhlenberg is 13-7 and tied for fourth place in the CC, just a game ahead of two other teams with five games to go in the regular season.</p>
<p>While it&#8217;s obviously a big game for the Mules, what makes this the Marquee Matchup is the history of the series. Muhlenberg has five wins against nationally ranked F&amp;M teams at Memorial Hall since the early 1990s, including a 71-67 win last year when the Dips were ranked 19th. The Mules have won nine of the last 14 against F&amp;M at home, and only one of F&amp;M&#8217;s wins was by more than five points.</p>
<p>Then there&#8217;s the presence of two of the &#8220;marquee&#8221; players in the CC. On the league&#8217;s all-time lists, F&amp;M senior Georgio Milligan is second in assists and steals, seventh in scoring and 11th in blocked shots. Muhlenberg senior Spencer Liddic is second in rebounds and double-doubles, 10th in scoring and tied for 16th in blocked shots. He needs 12 rebounds and a double-double to tie the CC all-time marks.</p>

<p><strong>Women&#8217;s Basketball vs. Franklin &amp; Marshall (Saturday, 2:00)</strong></p>
<p>This is a key CC matchup between two teams that are tied for second place in the loss column, two games behind Johns Hopkins. Franklin &amp; Marshall is 14-6 overall, 11-4 in the CC, while Muhlenberg is 15-4, 10-4.</p>
<p>The Mules, who won the first meeting, 62-54, looked like their former selves in beating Swarthmore, 81-46, on Wednesday. The Diplomats are coming off two impressive wins of their own, by 13 points at home vs. Haverford and by 14 points at Washington.</p>
<p>The top three scorers in the CC will be on display in F&amp;M junior Alexa Barbush (17.2 ppg), Muhlenberg senior Alexandra Chili (16.5 ppg) and Muhlenberg junior Alita Zabrecky (15.4 ppg). The Diplomats haven&#8217;t won in Memorial Hall since 2000.</p>

<p><strong>Track &amp; Field at New Balance Collegiate Invitational (Friday) and DeSchriver Invitational (Saturday)</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg will send a women&#8217;s distance medley relay to the Armory tonight for one of the most prestigious indoor meets. The Mule quartet is the only Division III team in its heat. The rest of the team will also compete against athletes from higher divisions at East Stroudsburg on Saturday.</p>

<p><strong>Wrestling at Washington and Lee with McDaniel and NYU (Saturday, 10:00)</strong></p>
<p>The Mule wrestlers will get to preview more of their opponents for the upcoming Centennial Conference Championships. New York University is in its first year as an associate member of the CC in wrestling.</p>

<div>Keegan had a busy and successful day at the Muhlenberg Invitational, placing in four events. She won the long jump and triple jump, led off the second-place 4&#215;400 relay team and finished sixth in the 55 meters. Keegan landed in third and fifth in the triple and long jumps, respectively, on the Centennial Conference performance list, and in third place on Muhlenberg&#8217;s all-time list in the triple jump.</div>

<div><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/01/liddichs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-662" title="Spencer Liddic" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/01/liddichs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Male Athlete of the Week &#8211; Spencer Liddic, Basketball</strong></div>
<div> </div>
<div>Liddic shot 60.6 percent from the field while averaging 17.0 points and 7.7 rebounds to lead the Mules to a 2-1 week. The two wins came in Centennial Conference games, putting Muhlenberg right back in the thick of the playoff chase. Liddic scored a game-high 27 points in a 79-69 win against Haverford that snapped a three-game losing streak. He also recorded his 39th career double-double (two short of the CC record) in a non-conference loss to DeSales. During the week, Liddic moved into third place on the Mules&#8217; all-time scoring list with 1,574 career points.</div>

			<p>Jim Gamrat is a thrower on the Muhlenberg track and field team. On Friday, life threw him a hurdle.</p>
<p>On the day Gamrat was looking forward to the Mules’ lone home meet of the indoor season, he received some horrible news: his academic advisor and research advisor, Dr. Charles Russell, had passed away suddenly overnight.</p>
<p>Gamrat had talked to Russell just the day before about their organic chemistry research project. They were trying to find an asymmetric ligand to use in a Heck reaction.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/01/gamrat.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-762" title="Jim Gamrat" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/01/gamrat.jpg" alt="" width="260" height="502" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/01/gamrat.jpg 260w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/01/gamrat-155x300.jpg 155w" sizes="(max-width: 260px) 100vw, 260px" /></a>And while that might be a little hard to grasp for those who aren’t chem majors, anyone can relate to the feelings Gamrat had for his mentor.</p>
<p>“We were really close,” said the junior. “He was an easygoing guy and a great teacher. He loved teaching. I really wanted to be a part of his research team. He was just an awesome guy.”</p>
<p>Muhlenberg head coach Brad Hackett said that when Gamrat reported for the meet Friday afternoon, he had a “stunned look” on his face. A memorial service for Russell was scheduled for 3:30, and the shot put wasn’t scheduled to begin until 4:00.</p>
<p>“I’m going to the memorial service, and then I’m coming back to throw,” Gamrat told Hackett.</p>
<p>“I did feel well enough to compete,” said Gamrat after the meet. “I tried to throw well for him, but it was difficult. It kept popping into my head, and that kind of clouded everything.”</p>
<p>Gamrat, who received plenty of support from two close-knit groups, the large track and field teams and the small chemistry department, finished seventh with a throw of 38-1¼. In was not his personal best, but it was still a noteworthy personal accomplishment.</p>
<p>“It was a tough day,” Gamrat said. “But we had to carry on.”</p>

			<p><em>by Kimberlee Yalango and Michael Baer</em></p>
<p>While the end of every school year is a time for celebration, it can also be bittersweet for members of sports teams, as they watch their seniors graduate. However, for the Muhlenberg track and field team, the home indoor meet is a time for all current and past</p>
<div id="attachment_752" style="width: 435px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/01/track_alumni.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-752" class="size-full wp-image-752" title="Track alumni" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/01/track_alumni.jpg" alt="" width="425" height="283" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/01/track_alumni.jpg 425w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/01/track_alumni-300x199.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 425px) 100vw, 425px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-752" class="wp-caption-text">Muhlenberg track and field alumni at last year&#39;s indoor meet</p></div>
<p>members to reunite on their old track. Since the outdoor home meet falls on a holiday weekend, the indoor meet is usually the only opportunity for alumni to come and cheer on their old teammates.</p>
<p>It also is the only chance for Muhlenberg students to come and find out what their “crazy” track friends are doing every day in the fieldhouse. </p>
<p>With the fieldhouse full of friends, alumni and family, the track team is always fully energized by the sea of red and grey. This motivates the team to perform well, even though the track, a 160-meter oval, is much smaller than the standard 200 meters. This tight space packs the crowd together, amplifying the noise during the closing lap of an 800 or the last exchange of the baton in the final event, the 4&#215;400 meter relay.</p>
<p>The small size of the fieldhouse does have its disadvantages. All of the field events, which consist of the shot put, the jumps, and the pole vault, must compete before the track events can begin. Despite this quirky arrangement, field athletes can still gain a home field advantage, since they are more familiar with the equipment and setup than the competition. </p>
<p>Even if you’re not a diehard track and field fan, the indoor meet can still hold something exciting. Want to see someone vault several body lengths into the air? Then come watch the pole vaulters, including Erin Saucier and Ryan Hellings, who both have the top marks in the Centennial Conference. Want to see an All-American and NCAA qualifier compete? Then come watch Peter Rice as he runs his first collegiate 800. Want to see someone fly through the air before landing in a pile of sand? Then come watch the triple and long jumpers, like highly ranked athletes Marc Brookland and Tara Keegan.</p>
<p>Or do you just want to watch a dedicated and talented group of athletes compete in preparation for the Indoor Centennial Conference Championships? Then come watch the Muhlenberg track team compete this Friday starting at 3 pm!</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/11/chilihs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-530" title="Alexandra Chili" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/11/chilihs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Female Athlete of the Week &#8211; Alexandra Chili, Basketball</strong></p>
<p>Chili sparked the Mules to a 60-57 come-from-behind win at Washington by scoring 18 of her 21 points in the second half. She netted eight straight points in one 71-second span that took the score from 38-23 to 38-31. Her steal and pass led to free throws that gave Muhlenberg its first lead, and she hit the game-winning basket with 43.1 seconds left. In three games on the week, Chili averaged 16.3 points to hang on to the Centennial Conference scoring lead.</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft" title="Peter Rice" src="http://www.muhlenberg.edu/images/main/athletics/men/trackandfield/hs/track11/ricehs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" />Male Athlete of the Week &#8211; Peter Rice, Track &amp; Field</strong></p>
<p>Rice recorded the fastest 200 meters time in the CC so far this year, running a 23.09 at the Lehigh Multi and Invite. He also anchored the 4&#215;400 relay team that posted the fastest time in the CC to date and came within 0.05 seconds of the school record in the 60 meters.</p>

			<p>It&#8217;s the first Saturday of the winter season in which all five Muhlenberg teams are scheduled to compete &#8230; and it&#8217;s supposed to snow. Here&#8217;s what to look for if everything goes on as scheduled:</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-104" title="Mule Marquee Matchup" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="237" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg 350w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1-300x203.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" /></a>Basketball doubleheader at Washington (Saturday, women at 2, men at 4)</strong></p>
<p>Chestertown will be the site for two pivotal games in the Centennial Conference standings.</p>
<p>The 14th-ranked Muhlenberg women (13-2, 8-2) will try to keep pace with Johns Hopkins (a half-game ahead in the CC) against a Washington team that is having an outstanding season. The Shorewomen (11-5, 6-5) have won nine of their last 10, with their only loss coming at Johns Hopkins.</p>
<p>Washington gave the Mules a tough battle when the teams met in Allentown in early December. Muhlenberg had a 15-point second-half lead slashed to five before holding on for a 71-63 victory.</p>
<p>The Mules lead the all-time series 32-4, but their only series loss in the last 16 years came in the 2006-07 season in Chestertown when they were nationally ranked (23rd).</p>
<p>In the men&#8217;s standings, it is Muhlenberg (10-5, 4-5) that is looking up at Washington (10-6, 6-3). The Shoremen won their last two games on the road against teams that handed the Mules their two biggest losses of the season (Franklin &amp; Marshall and Johns Hopkins).</p>
<p>Muhlenberg hasn&#8217;t had much success at the Cain Center, winning just four times in 19 trips since the start of CC play in 1994. Then again, Washington hadn&#8217;t won in Allentown since 1989 before pulling out a 96-93 victory in overtime in the first meeting this season.</p>

<p><strong>Indoor Track &amp; Field at Lehigh Multi &amp; Invite (Saturday, 11:00)</strong></p>
<p>After getting their feet wet at Kutztown last week, the Mules will start to get more of a feel of where they stand in their second meet of the season. The teams are improving the level of competition (at a Division I meet) and the quality of the facility (they will be allowed to wear spikes), which should make for faster times.</p>
<p>Several athletes who did not compete at Kutztown will make their season debuts, and the women will line up 4&#215;400 and 4&#215;800 relay teams.</p>
<p><strong>Wrestling at Gettysburg with Johns Hopkins (Saturday, 12:00)</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg kicks off its Centennial Conference dual-meet season with a tri-match at Gettysburg. Although the Mules do not have enough wrestlers to be successful in dual meets, the individual bouts are important for seeding at the CC Championships.</p>
