								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi again everyone! I hope that everyone is enjoying the warm weather that has FINALLY arrived. Here at Muhlenberg, the last few weeks of the semester are a frenzy of finishing up the academic year, scrambling to attend/host those last few events for clubs and organizations, and anticipating final exams in the all-too-near future. It&#8217;s a struggle to drag myself inside to study on these beautiful days (turns out studying outside under Victor&#8217;s Lament with all my friends isn&#8217;t as effective as studying in the library. Who knew?) Anyway, I&#8217;m having an awesome last few weeks and while I&#8217;m excited for a long, homework-free summer, I&#8217;m sad to be finishing up another awesome semester at Berg. Here&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve been up to lately:</p>
<p>-I went on a class trip to Northampton County Jail! As I have mentioned before, I am taking a sociology course called Inequality and Power which focuses on the American criminal justice system. As part of our research, we took a tour of the prison facility and got the opportunity to speak to a few different inmates about their experiences in the jail and, in a few cases, the drug rehabilitation program. While it was an incredible academic experience and I was lucky to see everything I&#8217;ve learned this semester with my own eyes, I have to admit the visit was a bit shocking. I was reminded to stay on the right track and always do the right thing so that I will never have to enter a jail again (I know you will be happy to see this, Mom!) I&#8217;m grateful to have had this educational opportunity- field trips and active learning experiences like this are quite common at Muhlenberg.</p>
<p>-Through The Red Doors! This past weekend, Muhlenberg hosted it&#8217;s annual &#8220;Through The Red Doors&#8221; day for both committed and prospective members of the Class of 2017. I feel like my own Through the Red Doors day wasn&#8217;t so long ago, so it was very interesting to be on the other side of things and be one of the more experienced students talking to incoming freshmen and their families. Since I am on Hillel Board, I worked at the Hillel table to talk to everyone about what Jewish life at Muhlenberg has to offer them. I met so many awesome people and I can&#8217;t wait for them to be on campus next semester! During these types of events, I am always happy to speak to anyone who will listen about how much I love this school, and how glad I am that I chose Muhlenberg!</p>
<p>-Spring fever! As I mentioned, the springtime is finally here to stay on campus and students are THRILLED. It was a cold, snowy winter, and everyone is ready to break out their shorts, flip flops, and frisbees. It&#8217;s so nice that as I&#8217;m walking down Academic Row to go to class, my classmates are outside on picnic blankets, reading and enjoying the sunshine. Some professors have started holding their classes outside when they can- it&#8217;s just too beautiful to pass up! We are in for a beautiful (and also crazy busy!) three weeks.</p>
<p>Until next time,<br />
Caroline</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi again! This week, all the students returned back to campus after a week-long spring break ready to complete the second half of the spring semester. While it&#8217;s definitely nice to have the time off to catch up on sleep and time with family, I always eagerly anticipate my return to school no matter how long I&#8217;m gone for. Even though this is the first week back after vacation, it feels like we&#8217;ve been back for weeks already! Life on campus is just as busy as ever, but the second half of the semester brings lots of exciting events and always flies by.</p>
<p>This week is especially hectic for me because it&#8217;s show week! I am a member of a performance ensemble, An Artist Collective, sponsored by the Muhlenberg Theatre Association. AAC is one of a few different performance groups on Muhlenberg&#8217;s campus, and our focus is on bringing together many different types of artists (dancers, painters, actors, sculptors, writers, etc.) and collaborating together to create anything and everything. Using each other for inspiration, we work hard to challenge the ideas of what art is and what makes somebody an artist. This Saturday is our first performance of the semester, and we have been working around the clock to make it absolutely awesome. I can&#8217;t tell you exactly what it entails just yet, but I know it&#8217;s going to be a great time both for us and our audience. Fun fact: I am not studying theatre here at all, and I don&#8217;t have any prior theatre experience, but I have the best time participating in the Muhlenberg Theatre Association. I meet a lot of awesome people, and An Artist Collective challenges me as an artist and as a student all the time.</p>
<p>I am also happy to announce that I am a newly elected member of Hillel Board! Hillel is the center of Jewish life on our campus, and an incredible resource to have here at Muhlenberg. I have been active in Hillel for the past two years I&#8217;ve been here, and this spring I decided to run for the position of Vice President of Publicity. Since Hillel is such a huge part of my Muhlenberg experience, I can&#8217;t wait to get started working with the other amazing board members and do amazing things for the Jewish community here. Currently, Hillel hosts several weekly events, including two different types of Shabbat services, a huge Shabbat dinner open to the entire college community, and yoga taught by certified instructors. In addition, there are often programming events (group discussions, guest speakers) about different issues in both the Jewish community and our campus community as a whole. I can&#8217;t wait to get started planning events, and becoming even more involved in this awesome organization.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s all for now! Here&#8217;s to hoping the weather keeps getting warmer and spring arrives on campus soon!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi everyone! I&#8217;m Caroline and I&#8217;m a sophomore here at Muhlenberg. I&#8217;m pursuing a major in Spanish along with two minors in sociology and studio art. While my schedule is sometimes hectic, it&#8217;s nice that I&#8217;m able to study three incredibly different fields during my time at school. That&#8217;s one of the benefits of a liberal arts education-students at Muhlenberg are able to combine many of their interests, including subjects that might not normally seem like they fit together.</p>
<p>This semester, I&#8217;m taking four awesome classes, one in each major and minor I&#8217;m pursuing and one General Academic Requirement. I start off my week with Postcolonial Realities in Spanish American Literature, which is an advanced literature class taught entirely in Spanish. We&#8217;re reading lots of awesome texts, and exploring poets and writers who I&#8217;ve never had the chance to delve into as much before taking this class. After that, I move on to Inequality and Power, a sociology course investigating the many aspects of the American criminal justice system.  I love that this class is discussion based, and I often come out of it continuing to talk with my peers as we walk to our next classes.</p>
<p>Later in the week, I head to the Center for the Arts for Painting II, a continuation of a class I took last spring. This is one of my favorite parts of the week because I get to take a break from the stress of my more academic classes and just enjoy the studio time. I&#8217;m currently working on a series of small paintings which will eventually be turned into a collage and later on a large-scale painting. (more on this later!)</p>
<p>My last class is Topics in Environmental Science, which fulfills my science requirement for graduation. I&#8217;m lucky that even though science is not my favorite subject, I have a great teacher who explains all the material in a way that is engaging and accessible to all students. So far, I&#8217;ve been enjoying the class more than I thought I would, and I like knowing that if I ever needed extra help, both my professor and the Academic Resource Center would be able to provide me with it.</p>
<p>I am enjoying having no Friday classes this semester, which allows me to spend time in the library and get a head start on my homework before the weekend begins. Although the weekend is a break from the daily class schedule, I still have just as much going on (sometimes more!) as I do during the weekdays. That&#8217;s a whole new blog post!</p>
<p>Until next time,<br />
Caroline</p>
