								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey everyone!</p>
<p>So, the semester is winding down, but events are still happening here at &#8216;Berg!</p>
<p>This past Thursday was my first go at the Muhlenberg housing lottery. Everyone in the college is assigned a lottery number, then goes to pick rooms in that order (numbers are given out by class). Every Muhlenberg student is guaranteed on-campus housing all four years, and sophomores tend to continue to live in hall-style dorms. However, for larger groups, there is suite living available, in the Benfer dorm. My friends and I all wanted to live together, and since we had a group of 8, we decided to sign up for a Benfer suite! Housing was a pretty stressful experience, since you can&#8217;t know which dorms will exactly be available, but luckily a girl in my group had a low number. And we got our Benfer!</p>

<p>So that was a huge weight off my shoulders. Then, Sunday was Relay for Life! As part of Colleges Against Cancer, I relayed with my team from 10 am to 10 pm. A cappella groups performed, as well as dance teams and other student performers. There was Zumba on Brown Lawn, and plenty of food! Relay altogether raised over $40,000 for the American Cancer Society, which is incredible! My team personally held an on-site fundraiser of tie-dyeing! We tie-dyed old Relay t-shirts and made a bit of money for ACS!</p>

<p>Now it&#8217;s time to start studying! I only have 9 more days of my freshman year left&#8230;it&#8217;s crazy!</p>
<p>Always,</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey everybody!</p>
<p>So, here at Muhlenberg freshman just completed registration for fall &#8217;14 classes. I&#8217;m still undeclared (you don&#8217;t have to declare your major until sophomore year here, folks!), but I&#8217;m leaning towards a business major, and playing with the idea of adding a psychology double major. But I&#8217;d also really love to study abroad, so nothing is decided yet.</p>
<p>This fall, I&#8217;m enrolled in the following courses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Intermediate French 2, continuing to expand my language skills</li>
<li>Macroeconomics, a business prerequisite</li>
<li>Statistical Analysis, another business prereq, but I also just really like math!</li>
<li>Industrial/Organizational psychology, or the study of how people behave in a business environment</li>
<li>Private piano lessons</li>
<li>The Dana sophomore seminar&#8230;this is a course for those enrolled in the Dana honors program. The sophomore seminar meets once a week, but its primary purpose is to be a service-learning class, and to have the weekly meetings serve as sort of check-ins. I believe we will be doing our service learning with schools in the Allentown school district, but I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ve formally decided anything yet.</li>
<li>Possibly a tap class!</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, I&#8217;m taking classes towards both of my (possible) majors, but I still have room to continue to take classes that interest me, or just that I love. That&#8217;s one of the great things about Muhlenberg, I don&#8217;t have to compromise what I love to fit a bunch of pre mandated requirements. I&#8217;m actually encouraged to follow my most random interests! I&#8217;m pretty excited about my classes, and the fact that I have 0 8AMs and only 1 Friday class doesn&#8217;t hurt either.</p>
<p>This past weekend was Easter vacation at Muhlenberg. Since I&#8217;m Jewish and don&#8217;t celebrate Easter, I spent the weekend traveling around my home state of Virginia to visit my friends at their schools! I&#8217;m glad the weather is finally nice because I was walking outside A LOT. It was great to catch up with my friends and see my family. I miss them so much at school, and I&#8217;m grateful to have had this break.</p>
<p><a href="http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/04/IMG_3636.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2875 aligncenter" alt="IMG_3636" src="http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/04/IMG_3636-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" srcset="http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/04/IMG_3636-300x225.jpg 300w, http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/04/IMG_3636-1024x768.jpg 1024w, http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/04/IMG_3636.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>Well, with nice weather and the last break out of the way, that means one thing: finals time is near! I&#8217;m glad that we had the weekend off, because from now on, it&#8217;s full out finals prep time. I go home in 15 days, and there is a LOT to do in the meantime!</p>
<p>Always,</p>
<p>Emily</p>
