								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I got a Facebook when I was 12, I was ecstatic because it was my first time using social media. I didn&#8217;t create an account to truly expose my identity, however. I just sought to communicate with my friends and acquaintances. In 7th grade, there was a trend with the girls in my school to change your last name on Facebook to the last name of your favorite male singer. Pretty soon I was no longer Sarah Kremen; I was Sarah Bublé, a 13-year-old with a Michael Bublé obsession. It was also a trend to be &#8220;in a relationship&#8221; with one of your best friends to make it seem like you weren&#8217;t single. To this day, I am still &#8220;married&#8221; to my best friend Naomi. It&#8217;s been so for 5 years.</p>
<p>It turns out, this trend wasn&#8217;t just a trend for teenagers at South Side Middle School. In <em>It&#8217;s Complicated : The Social Lives of Networked Teens </em>by Danah Boyd, social media is a toss-up because while some teens feel the need to take it seriously and make their profile as accurate as possible to depict who they truly are, others find &#8220;playful ways&#8221; to &#8220;respond to social media sites&#8217; requests for information&#8221; (Boyd 33). An example of a &#8220;playful way&#8221; according to the text is how teens like to make their best friends their &#8220;siblings&#8221; on Facebook to show how close they are. I can relate to this because on my Facebook it says I have 6 sisters, even though I only have 1.</p>
<p>Though it is funny to fabricate information on social media, doesn&#8217;t it defeat the purpose of social media? Now that I&#8217;m no longer 13, I depend on Facebook for providing accurate information about people when I go on their profiles. For example, after I came across my roommate&#8217;s profile for the first time, I assumed that everything she established about herself was true so I wouldn&#8217;t be &#8220;catfished&#8221; in essence. Nowadays, we are becoming more reliant on social media to learn about each other, which is concerning because it is so easy to create an inaccurate depiction of yourself.</p>
