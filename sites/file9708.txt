<p>Josephson made the most of her hits in a 3-0 week for the Mules, hitting .406 with only three errors in 32 attempts. In the two Centennial Conference matches against Bryn Mawr and Washington, she hit .524, recording six kills in only nine attempts in the former. Josephson also had 8 blocks and 4 service aces in the three matches.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/10/thomashs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1951" alt="Jeremey Thomas" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/10/thomashs.jpg" width="100" height="150" /></a>Male Athlete of the Week &#8211; Jeremey Thomas, Football</strong></p>
<p>Thomas filled up the stat sheet in the Mules&#8217; 38-18 home win against Susquehanna on Saturday. He had five tackles for loss among his seven stops for a Muhlenberg defensive unit that allowed only 144 yards, nine first downs and three points. One of his tackles for loss was a sack that forced a fumble on a third-down play, and he also intercepted a pass.</p>

<p><strong>Field Hockey vs. Washington College (Friday, 7:00)</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg&#8217;s Homecoming was two weeks ago, but this is the field hockey team&#8217;s homecoming. The Mules (3-6, 2-2) haven&#8217;t been at home in three weeks, playing five consecutive road games.</p>
<p>Their return to Scotty Wood Stadium is for a key game. Washington (3-5, 2-1) has been to the Centennial Conference playoffs each of the last three years. The Shorewomen have won the last three games against Muhlenberg to take a 12-9 series lead.</p>

<p><strong>Volleyball vs. Washington College (Saturday, 4:00); vs. Hood (Saturday, 4:00)</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/10/vb_dig4acure.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1943" alt="Dig for a Cure" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/10/vb_dig4acure.jpg" width="600" height="214" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/10/vb_dig4acure.jpg 600w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/10/vb_dig4acure-300x107.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/10/vb_dig4acure-500x178.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a>Muhlenberg will be hosting a tri-match while Digging for a Cure: All of the Centennial Conference volleyball teams are joining forces again this year to raise money for Tanner&#8217;s Touch, a non-profit organization that raises money for pediatric cancer research. Teams are collecting pledges for each dig recorded in a preselected match.</p>
<p>The Mules&#8217; designated match is against Washington, and it&#8217;s an important one between two teams looking to reach the upper echelon of the CC. The upstart Shorewomen (12-5, 2-1) have already swept two 2012 CC playoff teams (Gettysburg and Swarthmore). With a win, Muhlenberg (9-5, 3-1) will improve to 4-1 at the midpoint of the CC season for the first time since 2001.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg leads the all-time series against Washington, 18-2. Hood, the Mules&#8217; second opponent, brings a record of 4-10.</p>

<p><strong>Football vs. Susquehanna (Saturday, 1:00)</strong></p>
<p>Last year, Muhlenberg lost at Susquehanna, 17-0, for its first shutout loss in a Centennial Conference game since 1996. The Mules hope to avoid a repeat and head into the bye week on a winning note.</p>
<p>Even though the Crusaders are winless, they were leading in the fourth quarter of one of their losses and tied in another. They have already used three starting quarterbacks this season and rolled up 544 yards of total offense at Gettysburg last week.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg (2-2, 1-2), which has scored at least 58 points in each of its two home games, will try to take advantage of a Susquehanna defense that is allowing more than 480 yards per game. The Mules lead the all-time series, 11-10.</p>

<p><strong>Women&#8217;s Soccer vs. Washington College (Saturday, 1:00)</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg is playing at home for only the third time this season, and the first in two weeks. The Mules (4-5-1, 2-1) have never lost to the Shorewomen (3-4-2, 0-2), outscoring them by a 50-3 margin in 15 meetings.</p>

<p><strong>Men&#8217;s Soccer vs. Washington College (Saturday, 4:00)</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a very balanced season in the Centennial Conference; only a third of the way through, no team has an unblemished record and every team has at least one point. Of the 15 league games to date, only one was decided by more than one goal.</p>
<p>So even though the Mules (5-5, 1-2), coming off back-to-back games against teams ranked in the top 20 in Division III, have a 23-1-2 series lead against Washington (5-4-1, 0-2-1), expect a close game. The Shorewomen lost only 1-0 to nationally ranked Franklin &amp; Marshall and tied regionally ranked McDaniel.</p>

<p><strong>Cross Country at Paul Short Run (Saturday)</strong></p>
<p>One of the largest cross country meets in the country, the 40th Paul Short Run will include more than 6,000 runners from over 450 teams in 14 races. It will be largest field the Mules have run in this year, and it will be on the same course as their other big meet, next month&#8217;s NCAA Mideast Regional.</p>
<p><strong>Men&#8217;s Tennis at Oneonta State (Saturday, 12:00); Men&#8217;s Golf at Mason-Dixon Classic (Saturday-Sunday)</strong></p>
<p>Men&#8217;s tennis wraps up its fall season with a trip to New York, while men&#8217;s golf heads south for a two-day tournament hosted by McDaniel.</p>

<p><strong>Men&#8217;s Soccer vs. Franklin &amp; Marshall (Saturday, 7:00)</strong></p>
<p>This is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> what the doctor ordered for the Mules (4-4, 0-1), who have lost three in a row and scored only one goal in their last 280 minutes. Franklin &amp; Marshall (7-0-1, 1-0) is ranked in the top 15 in both Division III polls and is one of only two teams in NCAA men&#8217;s soccer that is unscored upon this season. (The other is Division II Lander.)</p>
<p>The Diplomats lead the all-time series, 30-27-5, but the Mules have the upper hand since the start of Centennial Conference play, 13-7-2, including two postseason wins. F&amp;M&#8217;s last win in Allentown came in 2005.</p>

<p><strong>Field Hockey at Dickinson (Saturday, 11:00)</strong></p>
<p>The Mules (2-5, 1-1) are playing the fourth of five consecutive road games and will try to reverse the outcome of the first three, all of which they lost 2-1. Dickinson (5-2, 2-0) has already matched its Centennial Conference win total from a year ago, including a 1-0 defeat of 2012 CC finalist Haverford. Muhlenberg won last year&#8217;s game, 4-0, to extend its series lead to 18-12-1.</p>
<p><strong>Football at Johns Hopkins (Saturday, 2:00)</strong></p>
<p>These two teams have dominated the Centennial Conference since 2000, with Johns Hopkins going 70-24 (.745) and winning or sharing eight titles and Muhlenberg compiling a record of 66-28 (.702) with seven titles. No other CC team has a higher winning percentage than .553 during that span.</p>
<p>Hopkins (3-0, 2-0), ranked 13th by the AFCA and 16th by D3football.com, has won 23 of its last 24 CC games and is averaging 537.7 yards per game while allowing just 236.3. The only negative stat for the Blue Jays is their minus-4 turnover margin. The Mules are a CC-best plus-7.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg leads the all-time series, 23-21-1, but Johns Hopkins has won the last two meetings.</p>

<p><strong>Volleyball at Dickinson (Saturday, 2:00)</strong></p>
<p>The Mules (7-5, 1-1), coming off Wednesday&#8217;s sweep of Scranton, will try to avenge a disappointing five-set loss to the Red Devils last year. Muhlenberg leads the all-time series, 18-14, but has not won in Carlisle since 2001. Dickinson (5-8, 0-2) was swept by Haverford and Swarthmore in its first two Centennial Conference matches of the season.</p>
<p><strong>Women&#8217;s Soccer at Dickinson (Saturday, 2:00)</strong></p>
<p>One of Muhlenberg&#8217;s biggest victories last year en route to the playoffs was a 1-0 win in Carlisle. Dickinson had defeated the Mules five straight times, once in the 2009 CC semifinals. This year, Muhlenberg (3-4-1, 1-1) will try to snap a two-game losing skid against a Red Devil (4-3-2, 0-0-2) squad that has been shut out in its last three games.</p>
<p><strong>Men&#8217;s Tennis at ITA Southeast Regional (Saturday-Sunday)</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg travels to Mary Washington for a weekend tournament.</p>

			<div id="attachment_1902" style="width: 110px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/09/cellaryhs.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1902" class="size-full wp-image-1902" alt="Kevin Cellary" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/09/cellaryhs.jpg" width="100" height="150" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-1902" class="wp-caption-text">Kevin Cellary</p></div>
<p>The late author Michael Crichton was a master of suspenseful, thrilling novels. There wasn’t much suspense in the Muhlenberg football team’s 58-0 Homecoming win against McDaniel on Saturday, but senior co-captain Kory Crichton (no relation) was involved in a thrilling, one-of-a-kind play.</p>
<p>The combined 72-yard return by Crichton and Michael Long of Kevin Cellary’s blocked field goal was an easy choice for the Play of the Week.</p>
<p>And it was all planned. Sort of.</p>
<div id="attachment_1901" style="width: 110px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/09/crichtonhs.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1901" class="size-full wp-image-1901" alt="Kory Crichton" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/09/crichtonhs.jpg" width="100" height="150" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-1901" class="wp-caption-text">Kory Crichton</p></div>
<p>The Mules led, 14-0, late in the first quarter when the Green Terror lined up to attempt a 27-yard field goal. Crichton’s job on the field goal block unit was to wrap around the end to guard against a fake.</p>
<p>“I really wasn’t expecting it to be blocked,” said Crichton. “On the film you can see I looked back to see if the kick was good.”</p>
<p>But Cellary did block the kick, and when Crichton looked forward again he saw the ball bouncing in front of him. So did junior defensive end Greg DeLade, who had come around on the other side of the line.</p>
<div id="attachment_1899" style="width: 110px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/09/longhs.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1899" class="size-full wp-image-1899" alt="Michael Long" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/09/longhs.jpg" width="100" height="150" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-1899" class="wp-caption-text">Michael Long</p></div>
<p>“I looked at him, and he looked at me, and I was like, I’ll take it,” said Crichton. “I think he was acknowledging that I was faster than him.”</p>
<p>In high school, Crichton was an offensive lineman and did score a touchdown as the fullback in a goal-line situation, but he hadn’t played running back since his Pop Warner days. His only previous time carrying the ball as a Mule was out of the end zone on an interception return of a Hail Mary pass as time expired against McDaniel in 2011.</p>
<p>The 225-pound inside linebacker picked up the ball cleanly at the 28 with plenty of open field ahead of him and took off.</p>
<p>“Once I got to midfield, I knew some wide receiver was going to track me down,” he said. “So I started looking around.”</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/09/long_mcd.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1900" alt="Michael Long" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/09/long_mcd.jpg" width="275" height="561" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/09/long_mcd.jpg 275w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/09/long_mcd-147x300.jpg 147w" sizes="(max-width: 275px) 100vw, 275px" /></a>Every Friday in practice, Muhlenberg does a “witcha, witcha” drill, in which a defensive player runs the ball and players behind him say “witcha” – “I’m with you” – so the returner knows where to lateral the ball.</p>
<p>Long was with Crichton, behind him on the right, but that’s not who Crichton targeted. It was sophomore running back Kamal Kendrick, who was just off his left shoulder.</p>
<p>“I figured we practice it, so we might as well use it,” said Crichton. “As I was throwing the ball, [the McDaniel tackler] got my left arm.”</p>
<p>Instead of going to Kendrick, the ball bounced to the turf – right into the arms of Long, who ran it in the remaining 40 yards.</p>
<p>The play gave the Mules a 21-0 lead and was as deflating for McDaniel as it was uplifting for Muhlenberg.</p>
<p>“It would’ve been cool to score myself,” admitted Crichton. “I’m glad we scored because it was an unselfish play. I think that was kind of the dagger, and it gave our special teams some momentum that hopefully we can carry forward.</p>
<p>“It was a very awesome play.”</p>

			<p><em>Some tidbits from the football team&#8217;s 58-0 Homecoming win against McDaniel yesterday:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>The win was the Mules&#8217; second by more than 50 points this season &#8211; they knocked off The Apprentice School, 59-6, two weeks ago in their opener. The last time Muhlenberg won two games by 50+ points in a season was 2002, when it opened with a 54-3 victory against Kings Point and made its NCAA Tournament debut with a 56-6 defeat of Mass.-Dartmouth. The last time the Mules had three 50-point wins in a season? 1947.</li>

<p>Freshman Nick Palladino quarterbacked Muhlenberg to the big win in his first career start, accounting for 334 yards of total offense on 264 passing and 70 rushing. Although he fell a little short of the school record for passing yards by a freshman in a game (290), he&#8217;ll get other chances this year. Something he won&#8217;t get another shot at: Palladino was the first Mule freshman to win his first start since Doug Donovan in 1990.</li>
<li>The defense kept McDaniel off the board for the second straight year and the third time in the last four years, marking the fifth straight season that the Mules have recorded at least one shutout. That&#8217;s the longest streak since Muhlenberg had at least one shutout for six straight years from 1999 to 2004. The Mules can match that next season, but to get to the school record they&#8217;ll have to keep going for a long, long, LONG time. Muhlenberg recorded a shutout every year from 1905 to 1943 in an era when (presumably) the offenses were less sophisticated.</li>
<li>Unquestionably, the play of the game was a 72-yard combined blocked field goal return for a touchdown in the first quarter. McDaniel was trying to cut its deficit to 11 points but instead found itself in a three-touchdown hole.</li>

<p><strong>Cross Country at Cedar Crest/Muhlenberg Invitational (Saturday, 10:00)<br />
</strong></p>
<p>The Mules compete in the closest thing they have to a home meet, crossing Ott Street to race for the first time in three weeks. Last year, the Muhlenberg teams swept this meet for the first time since 2008. Both Mule squads are ranked in the top 10 in the Mideast Region.</p>
<p><strong>Volleyball vs. Johns Hopkins (Saturday, 1:00)</strong></p>
<p>The two-time defending Centennial Conference champion Blue Jays kick off (or is it serve off?) the on-campus Homecoming activities. Hopkins comes in 5-4, with all of its losses coming to nationally ranked teams, while Muhlenberg is 6-4. Johns Hopkins holds a 16-5 series lead and has won 10 of the last 11 meetings.</p>
<p>Live stats: <a href="http://www.muhlenberg.edu/sports/vblive/topview.htm">http://www.muhlenberg.edu/sports/vblive/topview.htm</a></p>
<p><strong>Football vs. McDaniel (Saturday, 2:00)</strong></p>
<p>McDaniel nearly spoiled Homecoming two years ago, opening up a 26-7 lead before the Mules rallied with 27 fourth-quarter points. The Green Terror beat Moravian last weekend to snap a 13-game losing streak, while Muhlenberg is coming off a 28-21 loss at Franklin &amp; Marshall. McDaniel leads the all-time series, 22-18-3, but the Mules have won the last three meetings, rolling up a 413-168 margin in total yards in last year&#8217;s 33-0 shutout.</p>
<p>Green Terror senior running back Joe Rollins will be a player to watch, and one to tackle for the Muhlenberg defense. He rushed for 219 yards last week and is the ninth all-time leading rusher in Centennial Conference history.</p>

<p><strong>Women&#8217;s Soccer vs. Johns Hopkins (Saturday, 3:00)</strong></p>
<p>Johns Hopkins (8-0) soared to the top spot of the D3soccer.com Division III rankings after scoring road wins against then-No. 1 Messiah and then-No. 5 Carnegie Mellon. The Blue Jays are 37-4 in the Centennial Conference regular season over the last four-plus years, but three of those losses were to Muhlenberg, each time with Hopkins ranked in the top 10. The Mules (3-2-1) will look to make history repeat &#8211; again. They come in with a four-match unbeaten streak and an unscored-upon streak of 380 minutes.</p>

<p><strong>Men&#8217;s Soccer vs. Gettysburg (Saturday, 7:00)</strong></p>
<p>The last home event of Homecoming matches two teams that dominated the early days of the Centennial Conference, combining to win five of the first seven titles, but both failed to make the playoffs last year. Muhlenberg (4-2) is ranked eighth in the Mid-Atlantic Region, while Gettysburg (0-5) has lost eight straight dating back to last season. Included in the Bullets&#8217; setbacks is a 3-1 loss to Neumann, who the Mules beat. Muhlenberg holds a 35-18-6 series lead and is 8-0-1 against Gettysburg since the 2005 regular season.</p>

<p>The Mules (2-3) travel to Baltimore seeking to improve to 2-0 in the Centennial Conference for the first time in four years. Hopkins is 3-2 and opened CC play with a 4-2 win at Washington. The Blue Jays lead the series, 17-5, and have won the last three meetings.</p>

			<p><em>A look at the top plays from last week.</em></p>
<p><strong>Female Play of the Week &#8211; Bridget McNally, Field Hockey</strong></p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t exactly a &#8220;pick-six&#8221; &#8211; maybe a &#8220;pick-one&#8221; or &#8220;pick-five.&#8221; With the Mules ahead 4-1 in the second half against King&#8217;s, McNally intercepted a pass and took it 47 yards &#8220;to the house,&#8221; finishing for her second goal of the game and putting the exclamation point on a 5-1 win.</p>
<p><strong>Male Play of the Week &#8211; Ellison Heil, Soccer</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg led 2-0 early in the second half against Moravian when Heil came to the edge of the goalie box to punch a ball away. Unfortunately, it went right to another Greyhound player. As the clip begins, Heil is retreating to the goal, and he gets there just in time and has enough spring in his legs to turn away the Moravian volley. The Mules scored a minute later and went on to win, 4-0.</p>
<p><strong>Honorable Mention &#8211; Nick Palladino to Cody Geyer, Football</strong></p>
<p>The duo hooked up on a 54-yard touchdown pass in the fourth quarter of the Mules&#8217; 28-21 loss at Franklin &amp; Marshall. For Palladino, it was the longest scoring strike thrown by a Muhlenberg freshman since 1995.</p>

<p><strong>Field Hockey vs. McDaniel (Friday, 7:00)</strong></p>
<p>After winning their home opener in decisive fashion (5-1 vs. King&#8217;s) on Wednesday, the Mules stay at home to take on McDaniel in the first Centennial Conference game of the year. The Green Terror (2-2) won its first two games in overtime but has been shut out in its last two outings. Both teams finished 4-6 in the CC last year, and they played an appropriately evenly matched game, with Muhlenberg coming back twice to win 4-3 in overtime. The Mules lead, 11-9, in a series in which the road team has won the last four games.</p>

<p><strong>Football at Franklin &amp; Marshall (Saturday, 1:00)</strong></p>
<p>The defending Centennial Conference runner-up travels to Lancaster to face the team picked to finish second in the 2013 preseason poll. The teams&#8217; openers could not have been much different, with Muhlenberg rolling past The Apprentice School, 59-6, and the Diplomats losing to Washington and Lee, 14-13, on a failed two-point conversion in the final 30 seconds.</p>
<p>Franklin &amp; Marshall leads the all-time series, 52-43-1, but the Mules won the last two meetings by three touchdowns, including last season&#8217;s 21-0 shutout. Muhlenberg starting QB Joe Carlucci is the older brother of F&amp;M backup Anthony Carlucci, who played the second half of last year&#8217;s game.</p>

<p><strong>Volleyball at McDaniel (Saturday, 12:00); vs. Goucher (Saturday, 2:00)</strong></p>
<p>The Mules (4-4), who split on their first two weekends of play in 2013, will try to sweep this tri-match, just like they did last year, when they beat McDaniel in four sets and Goucher in three. The Green Terror (3-2), two years removed from a winless season, is improving but carries a 22-match CC losing streak into this contest. McDaniel leads the all-time series, 15-6, although Muhlenberg has won three of the last five. Goucher is 6-3.</p>

<p><strong>Women&#8217;s Soccer at McDaniel (Saturday, 4:00)</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg (2-2) takes its two-game winning streak into its CC opener against McDaniel, which outscored its first three opponents by a 16-0 margin before suffering a 4-2 loss to York on Wednesday. The Mules allowed only three goals in CC games last year, but one of them was to McDaniel in a 1-0 loss to open the league season. Muhlenberg went on to finish 6-3-1 and earn a playoff berth, while McDaniel ended at 2-7-1. The Mules lead the series, 13-6-1, and had not lost to the Green Terror since 2003 before last year.</p>

Defending champion Salisbury has to be considered the favorite to repeat; the Seagulls (37-4 last year) come in ranked 22<sup>nd</sup> in the Division III preseason poll and are off to a 4-0 start. The Mules’ first two opponents have already been swept by Centennial Conference teams – Penn State Abington (0-3) by McDaniel and Neumann (1-3) by Haverford.</p>

<p><strong>Football vs. The Apprentice School (Saturday, 1:00)</strong></p>
<p>The Mules open their 112<sup>th</sup> season of football with their only non-conference game of the season. Last year, in the first meeting between the two schools, Muhlenberg fell into an early 7-0 hole before rallying to win, 27-7, en route to an 8-3 campaign that included a bid to the ECAC South Atlantic Bowl. The Builders finished up at 2-8. Both teams will feature new faces on both sides of the ball. The Mules have won six of their last seven home openers, and when their first home game has been in the afternoon, they haven’t lost since 2003.</p>

<p><strong>Men’s Soccer vs. Ithaca (Saturday, 4:00)</strong></p>
<p>The last time these two teams squared off on Varsity Field, Muhlenberg won 4-0 in a 1995 NCAA Tournament quarterfinal match, earning a trip to its only “Final Four.” The teams didn’t play again until last season, when Ithaca made an early goal stand up in a 1-0 win. The Mules (2-1) are ranked ninth in the Mid-Atlantic Region and come in with two straight shutouts. The Bombers (0-2), the defending Empire 8 co-champions, took nationally ranked Oneonta State to overtime in their season opener.</p>

<p><strong>Women’s Soccer at Gwynedd-Mercy (Saturday, 12:00) and vs. Delaware Valley (Sunday, 2:00)</strong></p>
<p>The Mules go back-to-back for the second straight weekend after losing a pair of matches to regionally ranked opponents last weekend. Last year, Muhlenberg played these teams in the opposite order, defeating Gwynedd-Mercy 1-0 in overtime a day after losing to Delaware Valley by the same score. Gwynedd is 0-2-1 to start the 2013 season, while DelVal is 1-1.</p>

			<p><em><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/06/CSFathletes.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1807" alt="Ron Christian, Katy Mitton, Amanda Wong" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/06/CSFathletes.jpg" width="425" height="300" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/06/CSFathletes.jpg 425w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/06/CSFathletes-300x211.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 425px) 100vw, 425px" /></a>Earlier this month, three Muhlenberg athletes – rising seniors Amanda Wong (soccer) and Katy Mitton (basketball) and rising sophomore Ron “Big Ron” Christian (football) – participated in the NCAA Career in Sports Forum in Indianapolis.</em></p>
<p><em>The forum was an opportunity for NCAA athletes from all over the country and all three divisions to learn about the job opportunities in intercollegiate athletics. Some 700 athletes applied and only 277 were accepted into the four-day event.</em></p>
<p><em>Wong wrote about the experience:</em></p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">DAY ONE</span></b></p>
<p> The first half of the day was focused on values. Before the forum within our discussion teams, we had to fill out a survey about our own values. Through our values, we were able to identify what style of personality we are.</p>
<p>We were introduced to the DiSC test, which identified if we were <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">D</span></b>ominance, <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">I</span></b>nfluence, <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">S</span></b>teadiness or <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">C</span></b>onsciousness. Everyone carries all four styles, but usually there is one that is more dominant. Through the DiSC test, we were able to understand what are the other styles strengths and weaknesses along with how to work with them. From this test I was able to understand myself a lot more, and I plan on utilizing this test to my benefit when it comes to working with other people such as my teammates.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/06/CSF3.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1799" alt="Career in Sports Forum" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/06/CSF3.jpg" width="400" height="357" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/06/CSF3.jpg 400w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/06/CSF3-300x267.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/06/CSF3-336x300.jpg 336w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></a>The second half of the day, we listened to guest speaker DeNita L. Turner, President and CEO of Image Builders, Inc. She focused on the topic of branding yourself. This includes the importance of branding, how you carry yourself everywhere you go and how you represent yourself on social networking sites. Branding yourself creates your reputation and one slip up can easily lose you a job.</p>
<p>This portion was a wakeup call for most of the athletes, especially when it came to social networking sites. I think the most important advice DeNita said about the websites was  “if you are questioning whether or not you should keep something on your site, take it off.”</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">DAY TWO</span></b></p>
<p>Even though most of the athletes were exhausted from their early flights and long day from the day before, the energy was still high the next morning. Day Two was labelled “Big Picture of Intercollegiate Athletics.”</p>
<p>After our morning activities, we went off to our new set of color teams to experience the longest sitdown session of our lives. This session was focused on the ins and outs of the NCAA and where we can see ourselves based on our interests. </p>
<p>The session consisted of three rotations, and in each rotation we had different facilitators to learn more about their stories and experiences. This was a good chance for us to have the one-on-one attention from our facilitators to answer our questions and concerns about the different positions in the intercollegiate athletics.</p>
<p>Later that day we had another panel where we were able to find out other alternative careers in sports. There was Greg Pottorff, Attorney at Law; Julie Arnold, Director of NCAA Special Projects; Bruce Wimbish, Director of Marketing and Communications; and Charley Casserly, NFL Network analyst. This was the first time we had a perspective outside of administration and coaching where they gave us the insights about how to become involved with the NCAA in other positions.</p>
<p>They gave great advice about how we should always have a goal, how to build our resumes, how important work ethic is and why we should always take risks. I think my two favorite quotes from Charley Casserly were “the greatest investment you can make is with yourself” and “live cheap.”</p>
<p>After our long day of listening and working with one another, the forum awarded the athletes dinner at the NCAA Hall of Champions. It was like a big funhouse with a basketball court, virtual games and more. We were able to read up on the history of every sport and the NCAA. This was the place for us athletes to be competitive athletes and to act like kids on a playground.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/06/CSF1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1800" alt="Career in Sports Forum" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/06/CSF1.jpg" width="500" height="285" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/06/CSF1.jpg 500w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/06/CSF1-300x171.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">DAY THREE</span></b></p>
<p>Day Three was the hump day for most of the athletes. It was the day where we all had to dress business attire rather than business casual like the other days. Our emcee mentioned that today would be the most important day since we would be meeting more people who can help us with our future.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/06/CSF2.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1801" alt="Career in Sports Forum" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/06/CSF2.jpg" width="415" height="338" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/06/CSF2.jpg 415w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/06/CSF2-300x244.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/06/CSF2-368x300.jpg 368w" sizes="(max-width: 415px) 100vw, 415px" /></a>The forum focused on how we build our resumes and our “brand.” In our discussion teams, we were able to have others look at our resumes and receive feedback. The advice helped a lot, and luckily I was able to talk to Jill Redmond, Commissioner of the Atlantic 10 Conference, who gave me advice and even took my resume after I made my corrections. It’s funny how we can run into certain people and not realize they might be important figures in our future.</p>
<p>We also did mock interviews in our color teams to figure our strengths and weaknesses. It was interesting to see what our teammates picked up on about how ourselves.</p>
<p>We concluded the day with a Networking Dinner where the athletes were able to have the opportunity to have a sitdown dinner with two representatives of the NCAA. I am not going to lie, it was a little intimidating, but as the conversations took off, it became a productive night.  I enjoyed listening to many stories and have them answer our questions.</p>
<p>From all the stories I’ve heard, there seems to be a recurring pattern about work ethic and opportunities. If we work hard in anything we hope to achieve, the only person stopping us is ourselves. All doors are open and it is up to us if we take a step in. If it doesn’t work out, then we always have a choice to close the door behind us and walk into a new one.</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">DAY FOUR</span></b></p>
<p>The worst day finally arrived, the last day with very sad goodbyes. The final day was cut short to allow the athletes to catch their flights home. </p>
<p>After breakfast, the athletes and I had the honor to listen to Ann Gaffigan, Treasurer of the Track &amp; Field Athletes Association and the American record holder in the women’s steeplechase. She shared experiences with different job titles and making an impact on those she worked with. Ann mentioned how her values were tested and the challenges of being a woman in the sports industry.</p>
<p>In addition, we were even luckier for Ann to share her story about when she achieved the American record in the steeplechase. When all hope was lost and she had to fight through the pain, she challenged herself to be number one, and that she did. The whole room was hypnotized by her story, and I am sure every athlete in there was imaging their dreams coming true along with what they had to do to get there. Ann Gaffigan hands down was my favorite speaker during the whole forum, and I’m sure others will say the same. I encourage any athlete to research her story.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/06/csf4.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1804" alt="Career in Sports Forum" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/06/csf4.jpg" width="315" height="420" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/06/csf4.jpg 315w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/06/csf4-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 315px) 100vw, 315px" /></a>This experience will always be one of the highlights of my college athletic career. I could not be more grateful for the support from the Muhlenberg Athletic Department. I am also blessed to have the chance to share this experience with my two respectable Muhlenberg athletes, Katy and Big Ron.</p>
<p>I didn’t know what I was getting into, but I can honestly say I took out a lot more than I expected from those four days. I built friendships I plan on keeping for the rest of my life, I have more respect and interest in intercollegiate athletics after school, and I feel more prepared for what may come during my senior year. More importantly, I was able to reflect, discover, and appreciate who I am as a person.</p>
<p>I highly recommend this experience to anyone who is looking for answers or have any interest in pursuing a job with the NCAA. I will never forget or take this experience for granted. I would do it all over again and not change a thing.</p>
