								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Peoples, G. (29 March 2011). Amazon beats Apple and Google to the cloud. <em>Billboard</em>. Retrieved from <a href="http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/industry/digital-and-mobile/amazon-beats-apple-and-google-to-the-cloud-1005098372.story">http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/industry/digital-and-mobile/amazon-beats-apple-and-google-to-the-cloud-1005098372.story</a></p>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://cdn.pocket-lint.com/images/zYQm/amazon-cloud-drive-streams-in-1.jpg?20110329-123718" alt="" width="221" height="137" />The last decade has witnessed fierce competition between media companies whose products were initially quite different. <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a>, that little search engine that could in the nineties, today locks horns with <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> in the Internet TV and music exhibition market. Now <a href="http://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a>, that erstwhile book distributor, has announced that it, too, is joining the digital music fray. In a move that will <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/apr/03/john-naughton-amazon-cloud-drive-google-sony">light a fire under product developers</a> at Apple and Google, Amazon announced the debut of its new digital music service <a href="https://www.amazon.com/clouddrive/learnmore/ref=sa_menu_acd_lrn2">Cloud Drive</a>, which allows users to share their own music across computers through the Internet (the “cloud”). And, true to form, the recording companies are already finding reasons to go berserk about it.</p>
<p><span id="more-1024"></span></p>
<p>Amazon, of course, has been both exhibiting and distributing music for years. The new service will make Amazon a facilitator, as well. Users will be able to create an Amazon account, upload existing music files or buy MP3s right from Amazon, and access that music on any Internet-capable computer. By facilitating users’ storage of existing MP3s, Amazon obviously hopes to draw more users into its own MP3 store in an imitation of Apple’s<a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/"> iTunes</a> success. The company even offers discounts on storage space based on the number of MP3s the user buys directly from Amazon. And why shouldn’t they buy? One digital copy of a song is about the same as any other, and Amazon’s MP3s can live on the Internet instead of just one computer. All the people who lost their entire iTunes library when attempting to transfer it from one computer to another should take note.</p>
<p>It looks like Amazon may actually make some money off of this. And wherever you find an outside company profiting from a music service, you find the <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-31001_3-20048499-261.html">major record labels preparing to sue them</a>. The exact details of the labels’ problem with the service are a bit sketchy, but the main concern is a new form of P2P file sharing. Cloud Drive technically only allows users to share music with themselves on different digital platforms, but if one user uploads thousands of songs and then starts selling their Cloud Drive password for $50 a pop, a nightmare could ensue for the recording industry.</p>
<p>The record labels, possibly weary of dragging all of the world’s 7 billion people through the U.S. legal system, have indicated that they’re willing to drop the issue if Amazon re-buys the licenses for the songs they distribute through Cloud Drive, thereby reducing the financial impact of possible mass file sharing. So far, Amazon has adamantly refused. They claim that they are simply providing users with an online external hard drive. The recording companies have pointed out that it’s much easier to share music online than through a physical hard drive, but Amazon argues that the two are legally the same.</p>
<p>In addition to the labels’ lust for making users pay every time two notes of a song hit their ears, Amazon must also find ways to compete with Google and Apple, who are already calling Cloud Drive an inferior product. Google’s upcoming digital music service has hit legal challenges from the labels before it even debuted, but Google claims it’s working through the challenges while developing features for users that will easily out-compete Cloud Drive, including easy ways to store video and photos as well as music. Amazon, for its part, is basking in the glow of both upstaging the record labels and being the first in the new market.</p>
<p>Only time will tell whether all digital content—music, video, etc.—will migrate to the cloud during the next few years, but with almost all the major technology companies developing cloud-driven products, it certainly seems likely. The recording companies may need to be dragged, kicking and screaming, into this future. Now that other companies are finding ways to let users expand their digital music options, the labels will have to continue finding ways to continue profiting from their products. That is the industry’s current challenge.</p>
