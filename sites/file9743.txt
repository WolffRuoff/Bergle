The presence of large bodies of digitized text among your college&#8217;s subscriptions or on the Web affords the literary or historical scholar ample opportunity to design &#8220;digital projects&#8221; for students using readily available tools. Such digital archives expand the range of texts you can bring into the classroom, help you more easily achieve some of the traditional analytical and interpretative textual tasks that are at the heart of the humanities curriculum, and pose different kinds of questions for students than can be answered with the printed texts available in your library. Professors Lauren Coats (Louisiana State University), Laura Mandell (Miami University of Ohio), and Laura McGrane (Haverford College) will discuss work they have done with students using online archives. This seminar will be especially interesting to History and English faculty. &#8221;<\/p>\n<p>For more information, see the full\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.nitle.org\/live\/events\/121-digital-scholarship-seminar-digital-scholarship-in\">event description<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>To register, send an e-mail to participate@nitle.org by\u00a0<strong>February 18, 2011<\/strong>.
