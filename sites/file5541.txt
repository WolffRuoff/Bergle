<p>Following the Mules&#8217; NCAA Tournament second-round loss to Mount Union, Purple Raider football coach Larry Kehres came to Muhlenberg coach Ron Rohn and said, &#8220;I&#8217;d take your number 12 on my football team any day!&#8221; The endorsement of one of the most successful coaches in college football history helps Chili earn athlete of the week. So do averaging 18.0 points, 10.5 rebounds and 3.0 assists in two NCAA Tournament games and becoming the first Centennial Conference basketball player to score 2,000 points.</p>

<p>Vila hit .500 with four RBI as Muhlenberg won two of its first three games in Florida. He had an .833 slugging average and a .600 on-base percentage. Vila hit a game-tying three-run homer in the Mules&#8217; 10-9 win against Wheaton (Ill.) and singled in the middle of a two-run eighth-inning rally that led to a 4-3 defeat of Ohio Northern.</p>

			<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/kreiderhs.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-908" title="Tiffany Kreider" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/kreiderhs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>It started out as just a few words uttered in jest.</p>
<p>With the only goalie on last year’s Muhlenberg women’s lacrosse team a senior, the Mules knew they would need to find someone to fill the void in the cage this spring.</p>
<p>So when then-sophomore Tiffany Kreider heard the news from some of her friends on the team, she volunteered her duties.</p>
<p>Well, kind of.</p>
<p>“It was always kind of a joke,” she said. “They said they needed a goalie, and I said,<br />
‘Well I’ll do it.’ But I never really thought it would actually happen. Then one day I went out and took some shots, and I’ve been hooked.”</p>
<p>Kreider, who played on the field hockey team her first two years at Muhlenberg, had just a small understanding of lacrosse as a senior at Mifflinburg High School in central Pennsylvania.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/kreider.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-906" title="Tiffany Kreider" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/kreider.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="485" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/kreider.jpg 240w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/kreider-148x300.jpg 148w" sizes="(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px" /></a>The Wildcats did not get a team until 2009, when, ironically, current Muhlenberg assistant coach Cindy Wilson helped form a team while she was a senior at nearby Susquehanna University.</p>
<p>But Kreider stuck to field hockey and never tried her hand at lacrosse. That is until her friends on the team said they were in need of a goalie.</p>
<p>Flash forward 10 months, and there was Kreider taking her place between the pipes for yesterday&#8217;s season opener at Widener.</p>
<p>And while she said she had no idea what to expect, she was immediately thrust into a tough spot.</p>
<p>Facing a free-position shot less than 10 minutes in, she got enough of her stick on the ball to send it flying harmlessly away for the first save of her career.</p>
<p>That one save was enough to boost her confidence, and from there she soared.</p>
<p>Kreider stopped nine of the Pride’s 12 shots on goal to help the Mules pick up a 15-3 win. She turned away three shots from point-blank range and two more on fastbreak opportunities.</p>
<p>“I was really nervous, but this wasn’t just about one person,” Kreider said. “It’s a team game, and my teammates did a great job of keeping them away from the goal. All I have to do is make sure I’m in front of the ball, and with the way the rest of the defense played, that was easy.”</p>
<p>To anyone unfamiliar with the situation, she would have looked like a natural who has been playing the game her entire life.</p>
<p>But her teammates were not surprised in the least. They’ve seen her aggressiveness and tenacity from the first day of practice and think she has all the makings of a rock-solid keeper. And, more importantly, the perfect fit for the Mules.</p>
<p>“It’s incredible how quickly she’s picked it up,” said senior Angela Napoletano. “She’s been impressive since the first day of practice. She has no fear, and I can’t wait to see what she does next.”</p>

			<p><em>As the winter sports season begins to wind down, we take a closer look at Muhlenberg’s senior student-athletes. Over the next week or two, the MuhlBox will feature some of the highlights from the traditional senior question and answer profiles from each sport.</em></p>
<p><em>We start with wrestling, which wrapped up its season on Saturday at the Centennial Conference Championships, where seniors Kevin Homan and John Sternlicht each placed fourth in their final collegiate tournament.</em></p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft" title="Kevin Homan" src="http://muhlenberg.edu/images/main/athletics/men/wrestling/hs/wrest10/homanhs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" />Kevin Homan</strong></p>
<p><strong>How great did it feel winning two tournaments this season? What were the keys to your solid season?</strong></p>
<p>Winning two tournaments felt great. It&#8217;s nice to be having a great season since it&#8217;ll be my last with a great team to practice with everyday. Definitely having a new coaching staff and good people to practice with has made a big difference.</p>
<p><strong>What keeps you pushing through all the pain from training and having to make weight?</strong></p>
<p>The fact that this will be my last season of wrestling is my main motivation. I&#8217;ve been wrestling since third grade, and I&#8217;m going to miss the sport. If there&#8217;s one year to give it everything I&#8217;ve got, this is it.</p>
<p><strong>What’s the first thing you’re going to eat when the season’s over?</strong></p>
<p>Pizza and wings</p>
<p><strong>What’s the most memorable moment from your Mule career?</strong></p>
<p>Making the conference finals as a sophomore is one of my most memorable moments, but I&#8217;ve had several more that are pretty memorable.</p>
<p><strong>What made you decide to become a history major and political science minor?</strong></p>
<p>I was originally in the teaching program and planned on becoming a high school history teacher but decided to change my path later in college. Since I only had a few more classes to complete the history major, I kept with it and picked a political science minor my senior.</p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans?</strong></p>
<p>After graduating, I plan on going to the police academy and eventually become a cop. It&#8217;ll take a while, but it&#8217;s something that I look forward to.</p>
<p><strong>What kind of person is John Sternlicht?</strong></p>
<p>John is somewhat of a flamboyant person, I mean he has a tattoo of a rose on his ankle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft" title="John Sternlicht" src="http://muhlenberg.edu/images/main/athletics/men/wrestling/hs/wrest10/sternlichths.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" />John Sternlicht</strong></p>
<p><strong>How frustrating has it been dealing with injuries for a good portion of your career?</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s extremely frustrating. I&#8217;ve dealt with injuries my entire career, and it often seems like I&#8217;m stuck in an endless pattern of injury, recovery, rebuilding, training and right back to another injury.</p>
<p><strong>What’s the first thing you’re going to eat when the season’s over?</strong></p>
<p>I actually don&#8217;t cut any weight at all. I wrestled at 157 and 165 last year and was up to 184 this year. I&#8217;m actually more likely to eat healthier after the season so I can perfect my “beach bod” in time for the summer.</p>
<p><strong>You once owned the New Jersey record for career pins; how did that feel?</strong></p>
<p>It was pretty cool to hear my name announced in front of about 10,000 fans after breaking the New Jersey state record for career pins. It was broken only a few hours later, but it was certainly a rewarding way to finish out my high school career.</p>
<p><strong>What’s the most memorable moment from your Mule career?</strong></p>
<p>Due to injuries, I haven&#8217;t had much of an opportunity to make many good memories on the mat during my career as a Mule. I will likely never forget how much it hurts to rip both shoulders out.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your greatest off-the-mat accomplishment?</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve accomplished so many of my goals off the mat that it would be impossible to choose between beating Donkey Kong Country for Super Nintendo in 27 minutes, completing the Cluck-U 911 hot wing challenge, and memorizing all of the 33 words that use a &#8220;q&#8221; but not a &#8220;u&#8221; in the Scrabble dictionary. So I guess I&#8217;ll just say it was becoming the youngest black belt in Isshin-Ryu Karate history at age 11.</p>
<p><strong>How hard has it been balancing wrestling and school work?</strong></p>
<p>The toughest part about balancing wrestling with my school work has been finding time to do my work. With practice in the middle of the day, it doesn&#8217;t make much sense to start my work before practice, because by the time I get into the groove I need to leave. After practice I&#8217;m pretty tired and just want to relax. But I&#8217;ve survived by pulling plenty of key all-nighters and just powering through. There&#8217;s always time to rest later.</p>
<p><strong>What made you decide to major in political science?</strong></p>
<p>I came to school freshman year, like so many students here, expecting to follow the pre-med track. That lasted all of about a month. I didn&#8217;t really know what I wanted to study after that, but the 2008 election inspired me to pick up an American government course the following term, and the rest is history (or should I say, political science). I completed all of the requirements for the major three short terms later.</p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans?</strong></p>
<p>I wish I knew for sure, but I&#8217;m still exploring my options. The option I like best so far is becoming a multi-millionaire and spending most of my time on my luxury yacht. As soon as I figure out how to make that kind of money, I&#8217;ll be set. It&#8217;s only a matter of time after that.</p>
<p><strong>What’s Nick Pallotta like off the mat?</strong></p>
<p>There is only one Nick Pallotta. Everybody who knows this Italian stallion knows he&#8217;s the life of the party, but the ones that know him best know him as a loyal and generous friend with a heart of gold. Don&#8217;t let his intimidating physique fool you; he&#8217;s a big teddy bear on the inside. Just ask his girlfriend, Amanda.</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft" title="Nick Pallotta" src="http://muhlenberg.edu/images/main/athletics/men/wrestling/hs/wrest10/pallottahs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" />Nick Pallotta</strong></p>
<p><strong>How have you been able to rack up so many quick pins?</strong></p>
<p>I have been able to rack up so many pins over my career manly because I hit my bread and butter move in the beginning of the match.  It’s a great feeling to get a quick pin because I can save my energy for the next match.</p>
<p><strong>Is it true that all other wrestlers are jealous of heavyweights because they get to eat whatever they want?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, after having to cut to 197 my junior season, I can definitely say that everyone is jealous that I don’t have to worry about making weight anymore.</p>
<p><strong>What was it like taking ballet last year?</strong></p>
<p>Taking ballet was definitely an interesting experience. It was much more difficult than I expected and made me gain a lot respect for all the dance majors.</p>
<p><strong>What’s the most memorable moment from your Mule career?</strong></p>
<p>I would say my most memorable moment during my mule career came my freshman year when we wrestled Johns Hopkins. The match came down to me, and it was great winning the match for the team and tying for the league title.</p>
<p><strong>What made you decide to major in political science?</strong></p>
<p>I decided to major in political science because I plan on going to law school after graduation.</p>
<p><strong>What kind of teammate is Kevin Homan?</strong></p>
<p>Kevin is a great teammate that always brings a positive attitude into the wrestling room despite the many hardships that our team has gone through over the past four years. Kevin is by far the hardest worker I have ever met, and I think that his work ethic is the source of his success.</p>

			<p>When Bob McClure was in his late teens and early 20s, it was rare that an account of a Muhlenberg basketball game did not include mention of his tremendous accomplishments.</p>
<p>Who knew that the same would be true when he was in his 60s?</p>
<p>McClure, who played basketball at Muhlenberg from 1968 to 1971, has been in the news a lot lately as some of his records have fallen. It is a testament to how impressive his career was that it not only took 40 years to break his records, but it also took three different players:</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/02/mcclure.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-891" title="Bob McClure" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/02/mcclure.jpg" alt="" width="280" height="453" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/02/mcclure.jpg 280w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/02/mcclure-185x300.jpg 185w" sizes="(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px" /></a>• Last year, Spencer Liddic broke McClure’s 1970-71 mark of 508 points in a season. Liddic scored 509, and this year he passed McClure for second on the Mules’ all-time rebounding list and third on the field goals made chart.</p>
<p>• In late January, Alexandra Chili broke McClure’s record of 1,788 points scored by a Muhlenberg basketball player, male or female. Chili has 1,966 heading into this weekend’s NCAA Tournament.</p>
<p>• Ten days ago, Malique Killing broke McClure’s 1967-68 school record of 419 points scored by a freshman. Killing ended the season with 449, which is also a Centennial Conference record.</p>
<p>So what does McClure, now 62 and a financial consultant in Downingtown, Pa., think about all this?</p>
<p>“It’s a good thing!” he said. “Forty years is long enough [to hold the records].”</p>
<p>McClure played on the highest-scoring teams in Muhlenberg men’s basketball history. In his four years – with no shot clock and no three-point line – the Mules averaged 79.9, 85.8, 84.4 and a school-record 86.6 points per game. For the first three of those years, he formed a sensational trio with Ned Rahn and Mickey Miller. At the time of their graduation, they ranked first, second and fourth on the all-time scoring list. They still are first, fourth and seventh.</p>
<p>“We had fun with our team, and I hope they have as much fun now,” said McClure, the MAC South player of the year in 1969 and 1971. “We had three guys who could put up 40 points every game. We were a run-and-gun team. It was a different way of playing.”</p>
<p><em><a title="Bob McClure video" href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/02/bob_mcclure.wmv">Click here for video of the run-and-gun Mules in their short shorts, with McClure scoring two of his 1,788 points at the end of the play.</a></em></p>
<p>For all the high point totals and records, however, for McClure it always comes back to basketball being a team sport. And his Mules scored high in that regard too.</p>
<p>“We won three conference championships,” he says proudly, and that might be his most impressive legacy. Since Muhlenberg won back-to-back-to-back Middle Atlantic Conference South titles from 1968 to 1970, only twice has a team in the Mules’ conference (the MAC until 1993, the Centennial since) won three straight (F&amp;M from 1992 to 1994 and 2010 to 2012).</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/02/liddic_and_mcclure.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-893" title="Spencer Liddic and Bob McClure" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/02/liddic_and_mcclure.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="315" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/02/liddic_and_mcclure.jpg 400w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/02/liddic_and_mcclure-300x236.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/02/liddic_and_mcclure-380x300.jpg 380w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></a></p>
<p>McClure, who still owns the single-game scoring record of 44 points, was on hand at this year’s Scotty Wood Tournament to present Liddic with a ball for breaking his record, and he recently e-mailed head men’s coach Scott McClary with congratulations after the Mules qualified for the playoffs.</p>
<p>“I wish them all the best,” he said.</p>
<p>That “best” may include more of Bob McClure’s records going down in the coming years. And that would be a good thing too.</p>

<p>The Mules peaked at the right time, beating Franklin &amp; Marshall and Johns Hopkins to capture their record seventh Centennial Conference championship (no other program has more than four). It’s the second straight year Muhlenberg avenged a pair of regular-season loses by beating Hopkins in the title game on its home court. The Mules have won five of the last seven CC titles and are the first team in any sport in school history to advance to five straight NCAA Tournaments.</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft" title="Peter Rice" src="http://www.muhlenberg.edu/images/main/athletics/men/trackandfield/hs/track11/ricehs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" />Male Athlete of the Week – Peter Rice, Track and Field</strong></p>
<p>Rice went 4-for-4 at the Centennial Conference Indoor Championships to pick up his third straight Most Outstanding Performer Award for track events (2 indoor, 1 outdoor). He ran the anchor leg on the 4&#215;200-meter relay team that broke the school and conference championship meet records and set another meet mark in the 400. Rice missed the championship record by .01 seconds to win the 200 and closed out his perfect day with a gold in the 4&#215;400-meter relay. His 16 career gold medals are the most in school history.</p>

			<p>When she looked up, Alexandra Chili admitted she got a little scared.</p>
<p>She had just knocked down a pair of free throws in the closing seconds of the Muhlenberg women’s basketball team’s Centennial Conference Championship win at Johns Hopkins. But the game had been all but decided for several minutes, so she had no idea why her teammates were charging at her.</p>
<div id="attachment_868" style="width: 378px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/02/chilicelebration.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-868" class="size-full wp-image-868" title="chilicelebration" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/02/chilicelebration.jpg" alt="" width="368" height="360" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/02/chilicelebration.jpg 368w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/02/chilicelebration-300x293.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/02/chilicelebration-306x300.jpg 306w" sizes="(max-width: 368px) 100vw, 368px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-868" class="wp-caption-text">The Mules and Coach Ron Rohn celebrate with Chili</p></div>
<p>When they picked her up, the announcement came over the P.A. system: Those foul shots, the 339<sup>th</sup> and 340<sup>th</sup> of her career, pushed her all-time point total to 1,966, the most in conference women’s history.</p>
<p>“I was really confused,” Chili said. “I didn’t know I was that close, so I had no idea what everyone was doing.</p>
<p>“I’m just glad they didn’t drop me like they did last year,” she added with a laugh, referencing the celebration after her game-winning 3-pointer against Williams in the 2011 NCAA Tournament.</p>
<p>Her 28-point effort was just enough to surpass the previous mark of 1,965 set by Swarthmore’s Heather Kile from 1999-02. She is just seven points shy of the conference record for men or women (1,973) held by Dennis Stanton from 2001-04 and 34 away from 2,000.</p>
<p>It’s just the latest of countless milestones for Chili, who also holds the conference mark with 328 career threes (ninth in Division III history) and the school records for career field goals (649) and the top four single-season scoring and 3-point marks.</p>
<p>But for all of her accolades, including second-team Academic All-America honors this season and honorable mention All-America laurels last year, Chili said none of the <a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/02/chilirecord2.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-876" title="chilirecord" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/02/chilirecord2.jpg" alt="" width="267" height="461" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/02/chilirecord2.jpg 267w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/02/chilirecord2-173x300.jpg 173w" sizes="(max-width: 267px) 100vw, 267px" /></a>accomplishments ever came close to crossing her mind when she first stepped on campus three-and-a-half years ago.</p>
<p>Following an illustrious, yet somewhat frustrating, high school career in which she scored more than 2,000 points on a team that hovered around .500 most seasons, she was drawn to the Mules’ success.</p>
<p>She wanted to play for a winning program and had her sights set on team, rather than personal, goals.</p>
<p>“I never could have dreamed this when I was a freshman,” Chili said. “My goal was to just do whatever it took to help the team win. I’ve played with a lot of great players who have helped me during my career. This is not just about me; the record would not have been possible without so many great coaches and teammates.”</p>
<p>As she had hoped, all of her individual accomplishments have come hand-in-hand with team successes. Chili is part of a senior class that tied the school record with 92 career wins. The Mules have played in the CC title game in each of her four seasons, winning three, and advanced to the NCAA Tournament each year.</p>
<p>There have also been two trips to the “Sweet 16,” which she still rates as the two most memorable moments of her career. And she hopes there’s still a chance for one more run.</p>
<p>And that’s what has served as her motivation during her career. While spending countless hours in the gym taking thousands upon thousands of shots, Chili was not focused on numbers or records. All she could think about, she said, was winning, and more importantly, how much she can’t stand losing.</p>
<p>For as mild-mannered as she is away from basketball, Chili morphs into an ultra-competitor as soon as steps onto the court. And it’s that drive that has made her one of the greatest players in CC history, but more importantly, helped the Mules establish a tradition of excellence.</p>
<p>“It’s a great honor to break the record; there have been a lot of great players that have played in this conference,” she said. “But I’m even more proud of our team and how we came together to win the championship.</p>
<p>“I’m sure when I look back on my career the record will mean a lot more. But right now, I’m just worried about trying to keep on winning. I want to play at least a few more games.”</p>

			<p>It only lasted for a little more than two minutes, but Muhlenberg men’s lacrosse goalie James Fasola admitted he felt the proverbial butterflies in his stomach before the season opener against Montclair State.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/02/fasolahs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-857" title="James Fasola" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/02/fasolahs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Not only was it the first start of the junior’s career, but it was also his first action since his freshman season. So he wasn’t quite sure what to expect when he took his spot between the pipes.</p>
<p>But as soon as the first shot traveling upwards of 70 miles per hour found the netting of his stick a mere 2:03 in to the game, he said his nerves vanished on the spot.</p>
<p>“The first save is such a big thing, because when you stop that first shot it gets you in a positive mindset,” Fasola said. “You really don’t want to give up a goal right away, because then things can get out of control. So once I made that first save, I knew I’d be OK.”</p>
<p>He helped the Mules hold the Red Hawks scoreless in their five man-up opportunities, but even more importantly, he stepped when he was most needed.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/02/fasola.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-858" title="James Fasola" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/02/fasola.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="390" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/02/fasola.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/02/fasola-230x300.jpg 230w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>After holding Montclair State to just one goal in the opening 30 minutes, Fasola saved his best for last. He stopped four of the Red Hawks’ five shots on goal in the fourth quarter to help Muhlenberg keep a comfortable cushion en route to a 9-5 win.</p>
<p>The result was an impressive start to his career as the Mules’ starter. But according to junior defenseman Ian de Ruiter, it was just what he and his fellow defenders have come to expect after seeing Fasola in practice for the past three weeks.</p>
<p>“He played great, especially for his first game,” de Ruiter said. “He definitely stepped up, especially considering we were in man-down a lot. He made a lot of great saves and showed just how good he is.”</p>
<p>It was a far cry from Fasola’s Mule debut when he gave up three goals on three shots against Moravian as a freshman. But he has spent the past two seasons learning and improving, while also biding his time, waiting for his chance.</p>
<p>While getting his first win felt great, Fasola said it was more the product of a total team effort than his effort. And with four upperclassmen playing in front of him on defense, he said he is confident they will make his job as easy as possible.</p>
<p>“I was really nervous coming in, but I knew with this defense in front of me, they’ve all played a lot, so I knew they wouldn’t give them many good shots,” he said. “All I had to do was make the saves that any goalie needs to make. It was a good start, but I can’t wait to get back out here and do it all again.”</p>

This weekend, they get their final tuneups.</p>
<p><strong>Men’s Basketball at Ursinus (Saturday, 3:00)</strong></p>
<p>In the CC preseason poll, Franklin &amp; Marshall was picked to finish first, Muhlenberg second and Dickinson third. And even though Dickinson started out 2-4, and Muhlenberg was 4-6 just four weeks ago, that’s exactly the way things could wind up.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-104" title="Mule Marquee Matchup" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1-300x203.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="203" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1-300x203.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>If the Mules (16-8, 10-7) beat the Bears (9-15, 8-9 and out of playoff contention), and Dickinson loses to Franklin &amp; Marshall, Muhlenberg will earn the No. 2 seed and face Dickinson in a CC semifinal next Saturday. If Muhlenberg and Dickinson both win, they will play each other with the Red Devils as the No. 2 seed.</p>
<p>With a loss, the Mules slip to the No. 4 seed, and they would host the loser of the Johns Hopkins-Washington game on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The first pair of Muhlenberg teammates to each score 400 points in a season in 16 years, senior Spencer Liddic and freshman Malique Killing are approaching milestones. Liddic is 22 rebounds away from 1,000, and Killing needs 20 points to break the school freshman record of 419 set by Bob McClure in 1967-68.</p>
<p>Ursinus won the first meeting, 63-61, overcoming a 14-point deficit with 14 minutes to play. The Bears have won the last three regular-season meetings in Collegeville, two in overtime and the other by one point.</p>

<p><strong>Women’s Basketball at Ursinus (Saturday, 1:00)</strong></p>
<p>The Mules are locked into a semifinal playoff game against Franklin &amp; Marshall. They can earn the No. 2  seed with a win and the right combination of other results, but all that impacts is what color jersey they’ll wear in their first playoff game.</p>
<p>There are some team and individual milestones on the horizon. Muhlenberg (19-5, 14-5) will reach the 20-win plateau for the fifth straight year by beating Ursinus. In the College’s athletic history, the only team to post five consecutive 20-win seasons was volleyball (1991-95).</p>
<p>Senior Alexandra Chili, who on Wednesday broke the school record for field goals made by a basketball player (male or female), is within 57 points of the CC career record of 1,965. She hit game-winning last-second shots in two of the three games she’s played at Ursinus.</p>
<p>Ursinus (13-11, 12-7) has clinched a playoff berth but needs a win to secure a first-round home game. The Mules won the first meeting, 72-55, but the Bears are a different team at home, where they are 8-1.</p>
