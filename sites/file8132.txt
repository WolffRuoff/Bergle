								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After Google-searching my full name, I discovered that I share a name with a very well known and successful neurologist at UCLA. This M.D. Sarah Kremen works at an Alzheimer&#8217;s Disease Research Center, which I find to be interesting because my grandpa Kremen has Alzheimer&#8217;s. This Sarah Kremen consumed the majority of the top results, and I didn&#8217;t find any results of myself until the second page. The second page contains both my Facebook profile and my Youtube channel. The third page contains my one video on Vimeo, one Vine that I revined, and pictures of me on my dance studio&#8217;s Pinterest. After the third page, I can&#8217;t find anymore information on me. When I click on &#8216;images&#8217;, the top photos of me that come up are my profile photos of different websites/apps and my Pinterest photos. When I click on &#8216;videos&#8217;, all of my dance teacher&#8217;s dance videos from Youtube come up because she tagged my name in the description of the videos that I am in.Â If someone who doesn&#8217;t know me was to search my name in the internet, they would most likely come to the conclusion that I am a passionate dancer because the majority of the photos and videos of me are dance related.</p>
<p>This digital activity made me feel reassured that there is nothing too personal or too private in the internet of myself that I wouldn&#8217;t want the public to see. When I am older and job authorities are searching my name, I am confident that they won&#8217;t find anything that would prevent me from getting that job.</p>
