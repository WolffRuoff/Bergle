								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is no surprise that young adults spend more time with media and technology daily than any other activity. &#8220;It has been reported that young adults spend between 11 and 12 hours a day with technology and media&#8221; (Vaterlaus, Patten, Roche, Young 2015). Along with this, young adulthood has been said to be a risky time period for the development of poor diet and exercise habits (Vaterlaus et al. 2015). There are several factors that influence health behaviors, and it is predicted that social media could be a relevant factor in contributing to a person&#8217;s diet. Some of the considerations in making food choices include time availability and convenience (Vaterlaus et al. 2015). Interestingly enough, it is said that television may play a role in people&#8217;s dietary choices mainly due to food related advertisements. The connection with this is that when young adults watch advertisements about food, a lot of times unhealthy foods, it is likely that they could become hungry and add unnecessary snacks to their diet (Vaterlaus et al. 2015).</p>
<p>A research study was conducted in an effort to determine more specific influences of social media on young adult health behaviors. The sample consisted of young adults that were recruited from five courses at a midwestern university in the United States. The results of the survey showed that the majority of participants felt that social media does have an influence on young adult health behaviors. Three main themes appeared to be the main influences on the young adult experience with social media which are social media as a motivator and barrier to exercise, the perceived connection between food and social media, and the impact of posting pictures of food online (Vaterlaus et al. 2015).</p>
<p>Participants concluded that social media could be &#8220;both a motivator and a barrier to exercise in young adulthood&#8221; (Vaterlaus et al. 2015). As a motivator, social media provides specific apps like Nike+ and Map My Run to track progress on work outs. This feature increases accountability, and leads to physical improvement. As a barrier, participants felt that social media could become a distraction during exercise. An example of this would be a phone vibrating signaling a text message or other notification. Participants also reported that social media is associated with increased food choices, especially with applications like Pinterest, people can search for any kind of recipe they could ever want. However, people felt that constantly posting pictures of food online makes people more hungry, and therefore tempted to eat (Vaterlaus et al. 2015).</p>
<p>&#8220;Social media was perceived to be a distraction that could lead to (a) disconnection during meal times and (b) making poor food choices&#8221; (Vaterlaus et al. 2015). In this sense, participants explained that now people spend their meal times on their cell phone instead of conversing with those around them. Poor food choices are also more likely to be made because people are more interested in what is on their phone and may not pay attention to what they are eating, causing them to consume a lot more than planned.</p>
<p>Social media as both a motivator and barrier to exercise, the perceived connection between food and social media, and the impact of posting pictures of food online all connect because they each have some kind of impact on young adults&#8217; health. I felt that an article like this tied in well with class discussions and course readings because of how often we talk about social media and its various impacts.</p>
<p>I found this research study to be very fascinating, though I can&#8217;t say that I was surprised by the results. I was intrigued by all of the different angles in which the study was examined from in terms of social media being a factor in young adult&#8217;s health behaviors, food playing a role, and television commercials as well. I look forward to reading about what future studies show.</p>
