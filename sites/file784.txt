The economy collapses, but database and journal prices soar. Go figure. Swimming upstream as it were, Trexler Library is managing to keep pace with access to the most important databases, such as the acquisition of primary sources like the The Times (London), a paper of record for over 300 years.<\/p>\n<p>That said, the world of databases is vast. There are many things one would like to have, that one cannot afford. Fortunately, we have a kindly neighbor in Penn State Lehigh Valley, with access to hundreds of<strong><span style=\"color: #000000\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.libraries.psu.edu\/psul\/databases.html\">research databases<\/a><\/span><\/strong>. Located across from the Promenade Shops at Saucon Valley, this Penn State branch allows Muhlenberg students, faculty, and staff to use any of its databases, with a handful of exceptions, provided one is willing to visit their library in person.

Thanks to funding from the Provost&#8217;s Office, Trexler Library can make an inquiry on your behalf with the copyright owner, and then pay the requisite fees within reason.<\/p>\n<p>Simply contact Jon Macasevich, Library Reserves Assistant, to inquire. You do not need to have the materials you wish to post in hand. Library staff can obtain those materials, digitize them, and post them to Blackboard or Moodle on your behalf.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>Infomaniac Tip<\/strong><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><em><strong>The Hidden Google<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p>Google is\u00a0<strong><span style=\"color: #000000\"><a href=\"http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/6w3vxlp\">revealing<\/a><\/span><\/strong>\u00a0a long-time practice, that of suppressing thousands of links to materials deemed to be pirated content.
