<em>William Shakespeare, Romeo and Juliet (II, ii, 1-2)</em></p>
<p>This week in class we discussed the power of naming, identifying, people with various disabilities and the effects that come with naming; an example would be autism. For class we read an article that opened with Juliet&#8217;s Soliloquy from Romeo and Juliet. Although Juliet&#8217;s argument is that we can call things, in her example a rose, by any other name and it would still mean the same thing. However, that isn&#8217;t always the case especially in cases of disorders vs disabilities.</p>
<p>As students of psychology it is important to learn and remember how much of an impact our words have on others. There has been lots of research into the effects of labeling and if that effect is positive or negative. From our discussion it appears labeling tends to have a more negative impact on people. However, when searching for articles I felt it was important to show both sides of the argument. Some positive effects is it makes treatment A LOT easier for patients, especially with insurance, but their are consequences of being put under a big umbrella term. But you can make that decision for yourself! I have attached two brief articles followed by research in support of either article.</p>
