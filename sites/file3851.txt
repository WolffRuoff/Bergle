<p>On Tuesday, January 25, the Academy Award nominations were announced in Hollywood. While many people wake up at the crack of dawn to see the nominees for the Oscars&#8217; biggest categories, one category that remains essential but is consistently overlooked is Best Film Editing. This year&#8217;s nominees are Jon Harris for &#8220;127 Hours,&#8221; Andrew Weisblum for &#8220;Black Swan,&#8221; Pamela Martin for &#8220;The Fighter,&#8221; Tariq Anwar for &#8220;The King&#8217;s Speech&#8221; and Angus Wall &amp; Kurt Baxter for &#8220;The Social Network.&#8221; What sets these nominees apart from past years is the complete reality of the nominated films that allows for audiences to become &#8220;totally immersed.&#8221; As more films are produced every year, an editor&#8217;s task becomes increasingly difficult as they must take innovative approaches to presenting films with familiar plot lines.</p>
<p><span id="more-710"></span>Although films are written by the screenwriter, a huge part of the creator power role relies on the abilities of the editor. Every shot seen by paying audiences is cut and pasted by those individuals. Their work, that like these nominees, is what capitalizes on the emotions of the audiences and continues to bring them into theaters even after the Academy Awards are over. The Academy Awards&#8217; role in the industry is the exhibitor. For instance, at last year&#8217;s Academy Awards the Best Picture category held 10 nominees instead of the usual 5 in order to have more people watch the show and generate higher profits for viewings afterward. This is a great benefit to the motion picture industry because even though it is only the category of Best Picture that&#8217;s expanded, the fruits of the editors labors will be appreciated as well.  <!--more--></p>
<p>Since editing is so crucial to a successful film, why don&#8217;t people usually know who editors are? Can you even name the editor of your favorite film? Most likely, you can probably name the actors, perhaps even the director and the screenwriter. However, being able to name a film&#8217;s editor is far less likely. Throughout film history, editors have served as the backbone of feature films, working to ensure that films come together in a way that allows for cinematic impacts. Since their roles are almost always in a behind the scenes capacity, editors have not been given the recognition they often deserve. During the Oscar telecast this year, it is likely the only editor viewers would see would be the actual winner, with a high probability of music cutting off their speech. Although it is the actors and advertisements that typically draw viewers to films in the first place, it is the work of the faceless people behind the scenes that keep the motion picture industry running. <!--more--></p>
<p>On Sunday, February 27, when you tune in for the Oscars, don&#8217;t tune out the editors.</p>
