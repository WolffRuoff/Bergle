					<description><![CDATA[Interesting articles here, Group 2 - I suppose it was inevitable that Howard Stern would turn on Sirius/XM. However, I think you are a bit confused about the power roles here.  Stern would actually be in the creator power role, since he contracts with Siruis/XM to provide content that they distribute out to listeners.  Certainly, he is a powerful creator, but he is not part of the institutional producer power role.  Additionally, I don&#039;t think he is serving as a facilitator here - that refers to companies that provide ancillary services that nevertheless contribute to the health of the industry.  So, just have a look back at your power roles for review and check out your APA style as well.]]></description>
