					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Inappropriate posts are definitely an issue for Yik Yak. As we saw on our own campus, things said on the app can be very hurtful. I am not a fan of Yik-Yak because of its anonymity as are many other people.&lt;/p&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I agree that technology can create many benefits for education and learning. Very young kids are now using iPads to learn to read. I feel that with technological resources, young children can advance their learning more than in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I found this blog post so interesting and accurate. While reading it, I thought of a friend of mine who is currently playing field hockey at UNC. At one point during her whole recruiting process, the recruiting coach called her and brought up some questions about her social media account. The coaching staff was able to access her &quot;private&quot; tweets and retweets and noticed that she had a lot of content containing curse words which is obviously a big red flag. In order to fix this problem, my friend had to go through her Twitter profile and delete any tweet and/or un-retweet any retweet containing any curse words. I find this story relevant because in your post you mentioned something about how teens are affected by social media during the college application process and this is just another example.&lt;/p&gt;

				Comment on How Uber Has Changed Transportation by Chris Funge				</title>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I personally have never used Uber.  However, I might definitely have to consider using it after reading this. As someone who lives about a half an hour from New York, I can definitely say that you make a valid point in writing that empty cabs are scarce. I have used the subway in the past, but Uber could very well be more convenient than looking for a subway station or tracking down an empty cab. I know people that swear by Uber and your post reinforces much of what they have to say about it. I will definitely have to reconsider my mode of transportation the next time I visit New York.&lt;/p&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Awesome post! I was bored of listening to the same mainstream music over and over again. One of my friends told me about Soundcloud and I first visited it last year. The site is great for discovering new music. I would also agree that it&#039;s great from an entrepreneurial standpoint. As you stated, Soundcloud&#039;s connections with Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr, and Google Plus provide musicians, aspiring to be stars, with plenty of opportunities to make themselves known. SoundCloud is definitely a great site for both musicians and listeners.&lt;/p&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m shocked. The history of the selfie is quite remarkable and has evolved so much. I can&#039;t even believe it was that long ago when the first selfie was taken. I wonder who came up with the name. The amount of selfies taken per day is an insane number and one could only expect it to increase even more over the next few years. I think the recent increase in social media networks has had a direct impact on the increase of selfies taken. Without the boom of social media, I don&#039;t think taking selfies would be nearly as popular as they are.&lt;/p&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I agree. Selfies have become a huge part of western culture. If you think about it the idea of selfies someone probably thought it would be cool to take a picture of yourself even before 1839. Selfies have evolved so much in the last couple years.&lt;/p&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I found this post really interesting because prior to reading this, if someone would have asked me when I thought the first selfie was taken, 1839 would have probably been my last guess. Nevertheless, almost 200 years later, selfies are beyond popular in today&#039;s society. Some businesses exist because of the phenomenon; the selfie stick being one of the biggest contender in the pro-selfie business (I reluctantly admit that I have one but I only use it as a joke and to take big group pictures).&lt;/p&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I think that this is a very interesting article especially since iPads are so popular in today&#039;s society. iPads are convenient because they are small and not too heavy to carry around. However, the iPad brings may new tools that can become a distraction if overused, which I think can tie in well with this sense of an overload of information.&lt;/p&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I really like how you mentioned that people choose to act differently online. This concept relates to the idea of &quot;the polished profile&quot; in which people elect to display only certain things on their social media accounts. In doing so, people neglect to include serious issues that they may have encountered or may be encountering. A prime example of this is Madison Holleran who was from Allendale, NJ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Madison was a student-athlete at the University of Pennsylvania where she competed in track and field. By looking at her Instagram account, you would have thought that Madison was living an ideal life. She appeared to be doing well academically, athletically, and socially. Unfortunately, Madison was experiencing struggles that were not displayed on her Instagram account. Madison ultimately decided to end it all on the evening of January 17, 2014 when she took a running leap off the ninth story of a Philadelphia parking garage. She was 19 years old. Her story reinforces the notion that you brought up. That is, that people do not act the same way online as they do in person.&lt;/p&gt;
