<p>In this article, Jessica Winter explains the science and psychology behind why not only Facebook is the “frenemy with the most heads,” (Winter, 2013, p.2) but more importantly why Instagram is the greatest threat to our mental well-being. Winter argues that our social media outlets reduce us as individuals to a whole new level of shallowness.</p>
<p>Instagram is one out of many socia media sites that makes it extremely easy to morph a sub-par photo into a top of the line photo you would find on the front of a magazine. These days, there are countless amounts of editing apps that can not only brighten or sharpen a picture, but can change a person’s skin tone, make blemishes disappear, smooth out wrinkles, and even make a person’s teeth whiter. This kind of false advertisement is the reason “You get more explicit and implicit cues of people being happy, rich, and successful from a photo than from a status update” (Winter, 2013, p.3). People will spend hours upon hours experimenting with different filters and editing every small imperfection in order to create the “perfect” Instagram post. Not only this, but then they have to come up with the “perfect” witty and creative caption to capture their followers’ attentions. People will even spend hours simply dwelling over which emoji or hashtag is best to use. Although I myself am faulty of the endless battle of what filter to use, which caption to write, and what emoji looks best, I do realize that it is insane how much effort goes into just one photo. And why put all of this energy into an Instagram post? The one and only answer is: LIKES! Instagram is the one form of social media where getting the <u>most</u> likes is the <u>most</u> important. A lot of people think that the more likes a person gets, the more they are liked in the “real world.” However, this theory can be far from the truth. People are so obsessed with getting likes on their photos that there are even businesses you can pay to buy likes. It is absurd!</p>
<p>“Krasnova’s research has led her to define what she calls an “envy spiral” peculiar to social media. “If you see beautiful photos of your friend on Instagram,” she says, “one way to compensate is to self-present with even better photos, and then your friend sees your photos and posts <em>even</em> <em>better</em> photos, and so on” (Winter, 2013, p.3). Although Krasnova may be making a valid point, I don’t believe it is right to generalize this conclusion to the whole population of social media users. Your personal reaction to others’ posts and pictures is merely a reflection of your own character and self-worth. If you dwell in self-pity and jealousy, it is inevitable that you will “enter into a semi-consensual sadomasochistic relationship” (Winter, 2013, p.2) with social media. It is not the filtered, over-edited picture of your skinny friend in a bikini at the beach that is to blame, it is yourself.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Instagram is one of the most popular forms of social media that exists. The platform of this specific social media focuses solely on the posting of pictures with different filters and captions which are seen by a user’s followers who are able to like and comment on the posted photo. Although Instagram has a lot of positive aspects such as allowing people to be connected to family, friends, and strangers around the world, there are still numerous adverse effects that make the app not as advantageous as it is intended to be. In the article “The Instagram Effect: How the Psychology of Envy Drives Consumerism,” author, Lane Anderson lays out on the table all of the destructive consequences that stem from the thriving site. Anderson categorizes the most prominent aspects as “peer pressure,” “reality check,” and most importantly, “comparison.” Comparison is by far the most emphasized point in this article. Anderson interviewed multiple people and quoted them throughout the article and without fail, each person mentioned something about the envy that is typically instilled in majority of Instagram’s users.</p>
<p>A quote that embodies the overall message of this article was said by Andrea Mouritsen, a well-known blogger turned Instagrammer. In regards to “famous” bloggers receiving free gifts just because they are well-known on the Internet, Mouritsen said, “There are photos of (a popular blogger) pushing a $1,800 stroller while a professional photographer follows them. Suddenly, I feel like my stroller is a piece of crap, and it puts me in a state of annoyance.” This quote is so vital to relaying the author’s message because it shows how Instagram is being misused. Instagram is supposed to make the users feel unified with the people that they follow; whether people are following their friends, family, or a superstar, everyone is on the same level. However, when situations like the one above occur users are no longer on the same level. Instead, people are driven apart and it is often a person’s own fault for allowing this to happen.</p>
<p>This is not to say that comparison is always an awful thing. Sometimes it can be a constructive component that people utilize in order to better him- or herself or life. Comparison changes sides when people allow it to morph into envy and allow it to affect their life.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bullying has always been an issue but with technology and social media being so essential to our lives its become easy for people to bully other people online. With every social media its easy to bully someone. It is not hard to make a fake account or just message a person or even comment on peoples post. It makes it even easier due to the fact that you don’t even see the person’s reaction. But now you are on social media that is specifically for posting pictures, and you might think how could you bully someone over Instagram.</p>
<p>When I first got an Instagram I put my self on private just because I did not want random people following but I would have never thought about someone bullying on Instagram. Way too many people can see what you comment. It is not like Facebook where you might not stop and look at everyone’s post and comment. But for Instagram you purposely go on it to look at the pictures and what their captions are and you usually read the comments.  So why would any one want to even do anything mean on Instagram or any social media, it will always be brought back up. I’ve never seen any one being bullied on Instagram but I have heard of it happening.</p>
<p>When I found Cyberbullying Research Center’s blog post on Instagram and bullying I couldn’t believe all the ways you could bully someone on Instagram. They listed five different ways to bully someone and then told some people’s stories. I don’t understand why anyone would want to bully anyone but since it does happen, the big question is what do we do?</p>
<p>I see so many different adds and campaigns to stop bullying but it still seems to be going on. I truly do believe that more people need to start standing up to bullies, if you see someone getting bullied over social media then say something once one person does it I’m sure more will follow. To the person who gets bullied you might have made it better for them to see someone standing up for them. In the blog post a twelve-year-old girl posted a picture and got mean comments on it for no reason, but then that also starts the conversation of a twelve-year-old girl shouldn’t be on Instagram. At some point there should be an age limit on how old you can be to be on any social media. Someone that young shouldn’t experience hate like that. Even as a thirteen-year-old they shouldn’t have to be dealing with social media like that. Yes, it happens at any age but an 18-year-old might be able to handle a situation a little bit better then a twelve or thirteen-year-old. Cyber Bulling is a major issue in our world today and we all need to take steps to help prevent it because one day our own kids will have to be dealing with this. So trying to make social media a better place will help the future kids.</p>
