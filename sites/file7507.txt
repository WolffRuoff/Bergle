								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span lang="EN-US">When we talk about the 21 century, people will say: “oh, it’s an electronic information age.” and this fact is obviously. Nowadays, it’s very normal to see a 4-year-old child and a grandpa use IPAD to play “the angry bird”. But as a part of this electronic age, do we own something? Or in the other word, do we own our domains? “When it comes to all our digital data, the answer to the question “what you own” is probably “not much”. You do not own your Amazon Kindle books; you’ve purchased a license to access the content. Your heir will not inherit your digital reading library. You do not own the music you stream……” (Watters, 2016) Maybe someone will say we can print the images we posted in our Facebook. But who will actually do these things—print our self-portraits so that we can save them and pass to our heirs. Actually, few people will go back and see what they posted in the past.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">If we don’t have the domain of our own, who have? The company likes Google? Just like the example given by Jim Groom in discussion, though it’s free to everyone to use the Gmail, we actually pay it by the given of our personal information. Or the government, or none, or, from another perceptive, everyone can own your domains! We all know everything we posted in the net can be seen by public and everyone can own our images. What’s worse is that even we posted nothing in the Facebook, people may also own our images because our relatives or friends posted them in their Facebook. So we can easily image that, with the further development of science and technology, in the future, everyone can know everything about others including the kind of pens they use, the clothes they wear, and even the money they </span><span lang="EN-US">have</span><span lang="EN-US">…… Seems like the video “Scary Pizza” we watched in class discussion. Although the situation show in the video will not happen today, we should reflect on our own. Do I use the internet in a safety way, or what we can do to protect ourselves in a more and more complex network environment?</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">           Jim Groom lead an intriguing discussion about who controls what you do and what you put online. He played a video in which a person ordering pizza was shocked to learn the pizza place had access to a lot of personal information like his social security number and his health records. Although this was uploaded years ago to predict the future, it is a pretty accurate representation of how easily anyone can find your personal information online. Just this past weekend I ordered a pizza for my friends and I. In the middle of the conversation, the pizza employee said, “this is abigail right?” He then proceeded to repeat my location to make sure he was delivering to the correct place. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">           Looks of shock and disgust filled the classroom as we continued to talk about how easy it is for perfect strangers to know very personal life details. Although many parents try to come up with extremely unique names in order to have their kid stand out in life, it may be backfiring on the internet. Jim Groom mentioned that someone with a very typical or average name like John Smith remains anonymous. There are so many people that pop up when you google search that name that there is no differentiating. In the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Domain of One’s Own in a Post</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, Watter’s states, [it is important] “</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> having the space and safety and security”  (2016). However, because of the our lack of controlled ownership, anything we post online is owned by private companies. Therefore it is easily accessible for anyone to see our personal information. Our lack of knowledge and ignorance about this allows us to fall victim to these online companies that control blogs and social media. Becoming educated on this topic, has helped me become aware of how little I control and I will definitely be taking more precautions in the future about how much information I give out. </span><span style="font-weight: 400"> Despite the fact that we are considered digital natives, most of us lack the knowledge to make informed decisions regarding the internet and how we use it. </span></p>
