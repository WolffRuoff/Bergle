					<description><![CDATA[Frank Marino was a man of integrity.  He was a man for other men in his profession to look up to.  He was a great encourager to me.  He was always upbeat and always wanted the best for my teams and all the other teams at Muhlenberg.  He was as loyal as a man can be to all he came in contact with.  
Frank and Carroll were the epitomy of the Christ-like love spouses are called to share with each other.  They too have set an example for all of us.  Personnally, I am a better person for knowing Frank Marino.
