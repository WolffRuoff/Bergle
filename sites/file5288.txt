								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2">For a lot of our time together I have been glued to my fellow ensemble members, eating dinners together, going shopping together, and its been so wonderful to grown and connect with these beautiful humans (Can you tell I’m the sappy one?) But I am an introvert by trade, and for the last few days I’ve really been enjoying the quiet mornings and afternoons here in my little single, listening to podcasts and painting before rehearsal. And with all of us moving out of the village tomorrow I know the next few days are going to be particularly hectic, so I’ve been relishing this quiet peace for as long as possible.</p>
<p class="p2">But hey we’ve gotten so much done!!!</p>
<p class="p2">We finally had a rough draft for our blocking for the WHOLE script!! Like WHAT! WOW! I am so so SO EXCITED for it to be seen, we’re really creating something beautiful here! Something magical and true.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s my little splash of personality! Good luck to you all!</p>
<p>-James</p>
