								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Peoples, G. (22 March 2011). Rebecca Black&#8217;s first-week sales: Not bad, but not in the millions&#8230;. <em>Billboard</em>. Retrieved from <a href="http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/industry/digital-and-mobile/rebecca-black-s-first-week-sales-not-bad-1005084972.story">http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/industry/digital-and-mobile/rebecca-black-s-first-week-sales-not-bad-1005084972.story</a></p>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://cdn03.okcdn.okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Rebecca_Black_March17newsnea.jpg" alt="" width="216" height="152" />For those who complain that modern music is formulaic and factory-produced…well, it just got worse. The <a href="http://arkmusicfactory.com/">Ark Music Factory</a> released a music video by its new “artist” <a href="http://arkmusicfactory.com/profile/rebeccablack">Rebecca Black</a> called “<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2LRROpph0">Friday</a>,” which quickly went viral for all the wrong reasons (click the link to watch the video, if you dare). Heralded as one of the worst songs ever produced, the song quickly skyrocketed the teen singer into the public spotlight. The formulaic, ready-made, culturally-deficient song provided material for columnists and pundits all week and raised the ire of public advocates who claim that the Ark Music Factory is destroying music.</p>
<p><span id="more-991"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Ark Music Factory is actually only one of many “vanity” labels, which provide wannabe stars with pre-written songs, low-budget videos, and distribution and exhibition deals through <a href="http://www.cdbaby.com/">CD Baby</a> and<a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/"> iTunes</a> in exchange for a fee. Black’s mother reportedly paid Ark’s standard fee of $2,000 for her daughter’s trip into YouTube notoriety. And most of that money is probably profit for Ark. The shockingly underdressed tweens in Black’s music video are apparently Black’s friends and neighbors who agreed to hop into the video in exchange for their own three minutes of fame (and, as it turned out, humiliation).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Surprisingly, however, Black is already definitely making money from the song. As exploitative as Ark Music Factory sounds, it may treat its “artists” better than the major labels. After the $2,000 upfront fee, a 9% commission to Black’s distributor, CD Baby, and 9.1 cents per track to Ark for the use of the abominably-written song, Black keeps the rest. In fact, Ark even gives its “artists” copyright ownership of their recordings. Billboard reports that, as of Wednesday, Black had sold about 40,000 tracks through iTunes, and that number continues to rise. After crunching the numbers, Billboard reported that Black had already made about $25,000, pure profit, on the single. Considering that some of the biggest stars in the world—European grand-standing tours, MTV appearances, <em>Behind the Music</em> specials—are still in the red with their labels after selling millions of tracks, Rebecca Black may be the luckiest person in the music industry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And it’s not just Rebecca Black. Ark’s other “artists,” including <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xHfRUW99aI">Alana Lee</a>, are also apparently selling tracks and making money, and have been for awhile thanks the equalizing exhibition power of iTunes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ark can operate this way because of an ingenious business plan, which was partially stolen from the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgXg_7kVI8">Disney</a> model. First, they employ creators who actually write the songs for pennies per word. A sampling of Ark’s other songs reveals that the lyrics to each basically consist of “butterfly,” “soul,” and various days of the week scrambled into different combinations. And while that may be both hilarious and a sign of the End of Art, it’s also economically smart. As others have pointed out, who cares if the lyrics are bad? After all, it’s really no worse than much of what the major labels are putting out, probably for hundreds of dollars per word.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ark then produces the video and the song, both cheaply. The actual music was clearly produced by a synthesizer you can probably buy at Radio Shack, as was most of Black’s voice in the video. Again, so what? The song is catchy and upbeat, and that seems to be what most of the music industry’s audience wants.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then, Ark simply arranges a distribution deal with CD Baby and puts the song on iTunes and YouTube for exhibition. A few phone calls to music industry contacts from some of the Ark staff, some of whom allegedly facilitated Miley Cyrus’ rise to stardom (anyone surprised?), and this horrible song becomes the talk of the Internet. Ark provides all the resources for production and the linking pins that get the final product promoted on television and the Internet. Everyone involved is making money.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s also entirely possible that Ark made the song and the video bad on purpose. As they say, all press is good press. Sites like <a href="http://gawker.com/#!5783433/the-internet-made-rebecca-black-cry">Gawker</a> and Billboard that lampoon the video actually<img class="alignright" src="http://static.tvguide.com/MediaBin/Content/110321/News/4_thurs/110324RebeccaBlack1.jpg" alt="" width="257" height="177" /> actas Black’s best facilitators. Links to the video and to Ark Music Factory have appeared on almost every major hipster site in the past few weeks, and both Black and her mother have done interviews with the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9quaQjlzcOs">major networks’ morning shows</a> and with <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vQQucUWx50">Jay Leno</a>. A million indie artists who slaved over their life’s work for years before producing a song that no one listened to are weeping. Black has even become famous enough to <a href="http://www.contactmusic.com/news.nsf/story/internet-sensation-to-hand-over-itunes-cash-to-japan-relief-groups_1209597">start a relief fund for Japan</a>! Clearly, Ark is doing something right here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many would say, however, that Ark is also doing a lot wrong. The list of things wrong with this entire story is long, but there are things to think about here beyond just snarky comments about helicopter parents and why 13-year olds are wearing tube tops in a music video. The most pressing: Is this really what it’s come to in the music industry? People who advocate for diversity in the recording industry <a href="http://www.motherboard.tv/2011/3/18/the-ark-music-factory-is-churning-out-pop-slop-for-the-internet-s-cringeworthy-enjoyment">point out</a> that these sorts of songs may make sense economically, but they may be destroying America culturally. After all, this formulaic music mostly catches on because people with money and power—in this case, Ark and the Disney-bots they hire—can promote and distribute them across media. What about music’s ability to challenge authority and expose social issues? If songs like “Friday” are really the future of music, how will music’s role in society change?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Ark Music Factory and Rebecca Black may not care. In fact, they may accurately see themselves as the only ones in the music industry who are honest about what they do. The major labels often defend themselves against accusations of homogeneity by saying that they are producing and facilitating “art,” and “behind the scenes” shows about all the creative energy that goes into making a hit song abound. In reality, of course, Ark Music Factory is no more of a “factory” than many of the big labels.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If Ark Music Factory has a role in furthering American culture, it may be to increase the public’s awareness about how music is really produced.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jack, M., &amp; Hudson, J. (2011, Jan. 31). LX New York is Alive at Five. <em>Broadcasting &amp; Cable, (141,5).</em> Retrieved from <a href="http://0-web.ebscohost.com.library.muhlenberg.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?hid=8&amp;sid=f5b72ee7-0ab7-4b24-879e-1f00d0d749ae%40sessionmgr11&amp;vid=4" target="_blank">http://0-web.ebscohost.com.library.muhlenberg.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?hid=8&amp;sid=f5b72ee7-0ab7-4b24-879e-1f00d0d749ae%40sessionmgr11&amp;vid=4</a></p>

<p>Hoping to interest a new target audience, WMBC New York executives created the 60-minute news program <em>LX New York</em>, which airs daily at 5:00 pm. At first, ratings were less than impressive. As a result, the creators decided to implement some key changes to the show&#8217;s format. These changes were linked to another decision: WMBC executives decided to specifically target suburban women.  To increase show ratings and appeal to these viewers, <em>LX New York</em> started utilizing the city more.  For example, the show began airing cooking segments filmed on the city streets and in local restaurants instead of in the studio. The new and improved <em>LX New York</em> also features celebrity interviews, cooking segments,news snippets, and a topic of the day.</p>
<p><span id="more-823"></span>Additionally, executives brought on a new host, former news anchor Jane Hanson.  By serving as a familiar face, Hanson comes with her own fans, thus, brings more viewers to<em> LX New York</em>.  Producers also created a social media campaign, which included an online, live viewer chat about the show. Specifically, the online resources and viewer chats act as a linking pin for <em>LX New York</em>, an example of a symbiotic relationship between television and internet. Most importantly,the live chats provide a sense of community for fans, forming personal ties and relationship to the show while also providing feedback to producers.  That way, both audiences and producers benefit and gain a sense of power.<br />
<!--more--><br />
However, WMCS and viewers are not the only parties benefitting from the revamped <em>LX New York</em>.  A unique way the show presents its advertisers is through integration into segments, which would not be done in a newscast. For instance, the grocery store chain, Fairway, has sponsored cooking bits. This unique kind of advertising is enticing for advertisers since the product is actually integrated into the program, as opposed to using commercials, which can be bypassed.  This is especially relevant in the age of changing television exhibition, with technologies such as Tivo allowing viewers to simply fast-forward through commercials.</p>
<p>Competitors are thrilled with WMBC’s New York’s change because the new program does not target a news audience anymore, even though it is running during a timeslot traditionally reserved for news programs.  Of course, if the show does too well, it could spawn imitators, which could lead to the replacement of serious news with soft entertainment—a potentially dangerous transition for a democratic society that relies on an informed citizenry.</p>
