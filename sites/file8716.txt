								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hanski demonstrates that reading and writing are both necessary for the development of each other. It is not possible for either reading or writing to stand alone in each one’s own separate world. They are harmonious entities that build off one another to promote the power of knowledge and the discussion of morality. Every book has meaning and a message for an intended audience because, “every author writes for readers” (Hanski, 2014, p. 2). According to Hanski (2014), “Everything you learn as a reader, you can use as a writer afterward” (p. 2). The vocabulary and imagination that come with reading allow young minds to unconsciously think about writing. Writers are storytellers. They introduce new worlds and use society as a stepping ground to formulate social opinions and spread word of their ideologies. Readers are crucial to the survival of writers because there is not one without the other.</p>
<p>Reading and writing also effect our perceptions of the world and promote morality and development among all ages of readers. Hanski (2014) states that, “reading helps kids define who they are, as it connects them to the rest of the world” (p. 2). Reading provides knowledge of not only the world, but also of the self. With knowledge comes power, and for children to feel that power at an early age will lead them into a strong and morally conscious future. Reading provokes passion and imagination, essential for a successful life of education and learning. Literacy rates prove that, “poor reading skills can lead to a person’s social exclusion” (Hanski, 2014, p. 2). Those who are literate have a universal understanding of mankind, as compared to those who are illiterate. Illiteracy during high school has proven to result in unemployment, “most likely…by the age of 30” (Hanski, 2014, p. 2). This statistic demonstrates how crucial the incorporation of reading into one’s education is for the development of the mind and one’s advancement in writing skill.</p>
<p>Hanski’s use of transition words significantly emphasize his point pertaining to the positive effect of reading on one’s writing skill. His repetitious nature further promotes the impact of his thesis, specifically when he uses the words, “becoming”, “influences”, “impact”, “expand”, “improving”, (Hanski, 2014, p. 2) and so on. These words shine a literary spotlight on the importance of reading and writing, for they help develop his cause and help the reader understand that reading is a process that only gets better with time. Writing is not a skill that can be mastered overnight. Writing is a complex system that utilizes reading as its base and builds upon that base with experience. A person can never read too many books because reading and writing constantly change, developing as people get older and developing in itself as the literary world evolves.</p>
