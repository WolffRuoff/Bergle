								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How I feel as family weekend comes to a close is simple:</p>
<p><strong>bitter-sweet:</strong> Seeing my mom, dad, and sister reminded me how much I love and missed them. I have told myself numerous times that I am comfortable being alone across the country, and I still am, but the presence of my family touched on a soft spot in my heart.</p>
<p>In a short 48 hours, the four of us went out to two fancy dinners, ate two Muhlen-meals (amazing as always), went to the farmers market, walked around the scenic Dorney Park, and much more. Every moment was cherished as we laughed and caught up. It was just where we left off.</p>
<p>Now, four weeks lay ahead until we are reunited again. Next time though, I am the one traveling back to the other coast. That gives me plenty of time to accumulate stories to share over thanksgiving table.</p>
<p>Happy trails,<br />
Jake</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Is Allentown deceiving me? I was told leaving sunny Los Angeles and moving to Eastern Pennsylvania for college would have me perpetually scared of going outdoors&#8230; But here I sit in the middle of Muhlenberg&#8217;s campus marveling at the 72 degree warmth and feeling a lot like this place is literally my home.</p>
<p>I know, I know, my last post was referencing the rain, but honestly, that day feels like an anomaly in the scheme of this first month. For the most, part it&#8217;s all blue skies, crisp warm air, and sunshine.</p>
<p>When I describe my weather-oriented confusion to my friends, most of whom are east coast natives, I am promptly given an eery chuckle followed by &#8220;just wait.&#8221; Not sure what I should be waiting for.. or why they are laughing.. But I will get back to you in a couple of months with hopefully a good answer.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I&#8217;m going to finish this assigned reading and enjoy the view.</p>
<p>Until next time!<br />
