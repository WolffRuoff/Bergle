								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The advent of the computer has undoubtedly led to the emergence of three major operating systems. Aforementioned operating systems include Windows, Mac, and Linux. According to StatCounter (Wikipedia, 2015), Windows is the most widely used operating system by families worldwide. Windows is unique in that it contains Microsoft Office, “an office suite of applications, servers and services” (Wikipedia, 2015). Microsoft Office’s applications include the well-known Word, PowerPoint, and Excel programs as well as the Access, Outlook, OneNote, Publisher, and Project programs (Wikipedia, 2015). These programs provide students and professionals with a multitude of features that can be utilized to complete tasks in a timely and efficient matter. But, what are the specific features of these programs that make them so vital to academic and professional success? To answer this question, a further analysis of the three programs that Microsoft included in its original 1988 Office bundle—Word, PowerPoint, and Excel—must be conducted (Wikipedia, 2015).</p>
<p>Since its release in 1983, Microsoft Word has often been “considered the main program in [Microsoft] Office” (Wikipedia, 2015). Word is “a word processor” that was originally developed “for the MS-DOS operating system and had the distinction of introducing the mouse to a broad population” (Wikipedia, 2015). Though a mouse was not required for the program to operate, “Word 1.0 could be purchased with a bundled mouse” by those that desired one (Wikipedia, 2015). Word has played such an integral part in Office due to its sustained popularity. This popularity is due, largely in part, to its ever-expanding role in the lives of students and professionals. Students and professionals make daily use of Word when looking to complete tasks such as essays, letters, and reports.  Word’s user-friendly display offers a plethora of options for individuals to design, format, and review projects that they are working on. With Word, a user has the opportunity to pick from stunning fonts such as Broadway and Georgia, elect the margin size for a paper, and review the paper using the popular feature Word Count. Hence, Word’s seemingly endless possibilities make it a go-to for students and professionals looking to produce exceptional projects.</p>
<p>Another favorite among students and professionals is Office’s PowerPoint program. PowerPoint is a “presentation program” that enables users to “create slideshows, composed of text, graphics, and other objects, which can be displayed on-screen and shown by the presenter or printed out on transparencies or slides” (Wikipedia, 2015).  Visual presentations are crucial. Said presentations allow audiences to fully grasp the concept that the presenter is exhibiting during a presentation. Visual presentations are made simple by PowerPoint which lets users choose from many of the same gorgeous fonts on Word, set the presentation’s background to their choosing, and implement transitions. It is no wonder why so many people turn to PowerPoint. Whether its students giving a class presentation, educators teaching a new topic to their students, or business executives introducing a product to their clients, people rely on PowerPoint as a resource to convey the message(s) they are attempting to get across.</p>
<p>The final member of Microsoft’s “big three” from its original 1988 Office bundle is Microsoft Excel. “Microsoft Excel is a spreadsheet program” that was introduced for Windows on a “run-time environment in November [of] 1987” (Wikipedia, 2015). Like its close friends Word and PowerPoint, Excel is an ideal program for students and professionals. Excel is the perfect tool for projects that involve numbers. Excel provides users with cells, organized by column letter and row number. These cells will take the values a user opts to input into the program and then apply the values to a user-selected formula from Excel’s extensive formula list. Therefore, Excel is the perfect program for individuals looking to run a series of calculations. Students taking advanced business, mathematics, or science courses and people that work in analytics and other related fields praise Excel for its incredible features.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Microsoft Office is the perfect tool for students and professionals. Office’s trifecta of Word, PowerPoint, and Excel in addition to its Access, Outlook, Publisher, OneNote and Project programs provide individuals with an array of features that can be utilized to complete tasks effectively. Since its release in 1988, Microsoft Office has built a reputation for itself as a consistently reliable set of applications. As a result, people turn to Office and will continue to do so as they look to produce high-caliber projects.</p>
