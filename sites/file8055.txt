								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Social media has impacted almost all aspects of our lives in one way or another. It changes the way people receive news, travel places, make purchases, communicate, the list goes on and on. Today I am going to focus on social medias impact on businesses. After reading pages 1-25 of Brand Buzz in the Echoverse by K. Hewett, W. Rand, R. Rust and H. Heerde, I have a much deeper knowledge on this topic. Businesses are now realizing that they must take advantage of all of their possible communication tools and a big one, especially in this generation is social media.  Through social media, much can be accomplished and in much faster, precise ways. Social media is a platform that allows a single individual or company to reach millions in seconds by blogging or tweeting  and whatnot. When businesses have news to share or prices to reveal, social media is the ideal place for them to post about it and have it reach millions of possible customers. Almost everyday as I go through my twitter feed,  I will find advertisements for the &#8220;hottest new cloths&#8221; or &#8220;the best deal around&#8221;. These companies are using twitter as  a place to advertise that was not available before. Social media is also important for businesses when it comes to damage control. Bad news travels fast and sometimes it can spell the end of a businesses success. One way that companies are able to contain bad news or in most cases cut their losses is to stay on top of it on social media. Company tweets have been proven to improve bad situations, the more tweets posted by them, results in less negative tweets by other people. Twitter can be so effective in this way as a result of the changing way people receive their news. Social media is a growing factor in the news industry and it has become increasingly clear that people are going through sites like Twitter to find news and information that they would have normally found elsewhere. Compared to the radio, televisions, newspaper and others, social media is faster, more personalized and more accessible. Not all social media sites are equivalent when referring to businesses needs. Twitter has been found to contain more of the information and news sharing as apposed to Facebook which is more personal information and communication. Social media has changed the way businesses operate in many ways, it can help companies with advertisement to crowd control and that will help any business succeed.</p>
