								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m here in Arezzo Italy! I&#8217;ve been here for almost two weeks now, and I&#8217;m finally settled in to my room and my schedule here.</p>
<p>First of all it&#8217;s BEAUTIFUL here, everywhere you look there is gorgeous view of Â Tuscany. My schedule is such that I have about 3, 2-hour classes a day Monday through Friday and breakfast, lunch and dinner throughout the day. So it&#8217;s a pretty tight schedule, but I love it! I&#8217;m taking a Movement Class (which is kind of a mix of Modern dance and Yoga), a Voice and Speech class, a Philosophy of the Arts class, and Italian! Starting Monday we will have our first Commedia Class, which is a certain type of theater that we are focusing on here in Italy!</p>
<p>Every class has been SO wonderful and I&#8217;ve already learned so much! Our Movement teacher is Claudia; she is German, and she is so talented, OH MY GOD! She makes everything look so effortless and beautiful, it&#8217;s amazing. Voice and Speech is taught by Kevin (if any of you got to see last year&#8217;s production of Bartholomew Fair, it was directed by Kevin). He is a hilarious British man who does lots of fun and hard exercises with us so that we can learn how to project and scream and cry and laugh on stage without straining our voices. Philosophy is taught by a Syrian woman (whose name I can&#8217;t remember!), and so far it is a very interesting class. I&#8217;m lucky to have a class with some differing point of views on our readings, and we always have a great discussion! For example: we had a wonderful class discussion on whether Comedy was &#8220;better&#8221; than Tragedy! We came to the conclusion that both are needed in a show or any piece of art to be successful; so that when dealing with tragic matters comedy can lighten the mood and keep the audience interested, or having tragic matter in comedies to keep a piece grounded. Lastly Italian; I&#8217;ve taken two semesters of Italian at Muhlenberg, so I am in the second level Italian class with 6 other people from Muhlenberg. A few people have taken Italian recently and a few (like myself) took it freshman year, so this week has been lots and lots or review for us, but so far it&#8217;s going well!</p>
<p>We eat breakfast, lunch and dinner Monday- Friday here in the villa and then have time on the weekends to explore other places or the town of Arezzo!Â The food here is INCREDIBLE! Seriously, I&#8217;m not sure I will ever be able to leave here because the food just won&#8217;t be the same! Everything here is just so fresh; the pasta, the pizza, the meat, the vegetables &#8211; it&#8217;s seriously crazy good. But what I have found to be the most beloved of all the food here is&#8230;.NUTELLA! Yes the wonderful hazelnut and chocolate mix that becomes nutella is actually more amazing (if that&#8217;s possible) here than in the USA, and everyone here agrees! We have it for breakfast, lunch and dinner, usually on bread, but my friends and I have started having it with bananas for dessert (sort of healthy right?).</p>
<p>Well that&#8217;s all for now! I&#8217;m visiting the beach town of Viareggio Italy this weekend, so I&#8217;ll have some fun updates from there! Until next time <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
