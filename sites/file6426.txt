								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Halloween is one of the most anticipated &#8220;holidays&#8221; of the entire year. While few actually know the historical significance of the annual fall celebration, the societal expectation embraced by all is to to dress up. In fact, Halloween incites so much excitement here, that instead of partaking in costume festivities only on the 31st of October, students plan three outfits for the Thursday, Friday, and Saturday of the weekend. This phenomenon is actually not unique to this school, as I was made aware through various forms of social media that my friends around the country were doing the same.</p>
<p>Given the theatrical and artistic foundations of Muhlenberg, it is no surprise students compile both clever and sophisticated costumes. For example, I saw a variety of imitated animals, television stars, food items, and even pop cultural characters from decades ago (leave it to berg students to be extremely ironic with costumes).</p>
<p>Unfortunately for me, I could not go out on Thursday or Friday because I had a wrestling tournament on Saturday. However, the one night I did go out was amazing and adequately hyped. Let&#8217;s start the countdown until next year!</p>
<p>Til next time!<br />

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Having your parents visit you in college incites a variety of unique emotions- none of which really relate to each other.</p>
<p><strong>nostalgia- </strong> After not seeing the people that have loved me unconditionally, raised me, provided selflessly for me and simply lived with me for my entire life, I miss them. My family means the world to me, and at time it has been difficult being almost three thousand miles away with a three-hour time change. Them coming here is already bringing back so many great feelings and memories.</p>
<p><strong>confusion-</strong> I have done a fair share of traveling in my day, and so have both my parents; however, nothing in my prior experience has been of this sort. Usually, I leave the house, and return to my house, or, one of them will leave the house and return to my house. Now, they are leaving my &#8220;old home&#8221; and traveling to my &#8220;new home,&#8221; then returning to my old home. I am not sure if that makes perfect sense, but in context it is leaving me very confused. Since when did I have two homes? Ahhh!</p>
<p><strong>excitement- </strong>Talking on the phone or texting can never fill the void of not seeing the people you love dearly. I can&#8217;t wait to show my parents and my sister what life has been like the last two months on my own. I want to show off all my favorite parts of campus so they know everything is great here.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re on the way now! Counting down&#8230;</p>
