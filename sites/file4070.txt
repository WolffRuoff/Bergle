								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I left my house packed and ready for college on August 19th, just over three months ago. And unlike most of my east-coast-native friends, I have yet to return to my Los Angeles room since this semester has began. Three months is a long time not to be home, and I miss it. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I love Muhlenberg. I love my classes, my friends, wrestling, the campus&#8230; etc. My mild homesickness has nothing to do with the school, it just has to do with wanting to go back to the place I know so well.</p>
<p>1. <strong>Food</strong>&#8211; The Muhlenberg food is phenomenal. It wows me daily with its flavor and quality. Regardless though, nothing beats mom&#8217;s home cooked meals. My whole life I have been spoiled with a myriad of fine-dining quality foods, cooked from my kitchen, by my talented mother. So, I can&#8217;t wait to see what she has in store for Thanksgiving this year as head chef.</p>
<p>2. <b>Family- </b><span style="color: #000000;">Yes, I am friends with all my aunts, uncles, cousins, parents, and sister, on Facebook. So, on a </span>daily<span style="color: #000000;"> basis I get to read their thoughts and posts, and see their pictures, but Facebook with never be able to replicate or </span>replace<span style="color: #000000;"> the deep bond that all branches of the Gordon family have. We have all of our quirks and </span>idiosyncrasies that makes the family unique and special. I am counting down the hours until all of us can reunite and catch up.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Weather- </strong>While the weather change is exciting, it hasn&#8217;t taken long until the 25-30 degree Allentown days have gotten old, and everyday 70 and sunny of back home is merely a memory. While home, I plan to hike, run, bike, go to the beach, go to the park, and generally take advantage of the famous LA weather that I can now appreciate so much more.</p>
<p>4. <strong>My bed- </strong>This one is pretty self explanatory. I am going to crawl under the covers in my bed for the first time in months! Can&#8217;t Wait!</p>
<p>I will report back post-Thanksgiving with updates and pictures!</p>
