(2011, February 25). Reporters, publicists play game year-round. <em>Variety</em>. Retrieved from <a href="http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118032485?refcatid=1985">http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118032485?refcatid=1985</a>.</p>
<p>A new development in the relationship between Hollywood publicists and news journalists has heightened to a new level, regardless of the time of year. Publicists and news journalists often have agendas of different sorts; while publicists want to promote positive images of their clients, news journalists are constantly trying to find new stories, no matter what type of light is shed on the subjects of the investigation. In years prior, however, Hollywood publicists and entertainment journalists&#8217; goals would often converge during awards season. In the period of time from October to late February, in which all eyes and ears are focused on the &#8220;awards-season beast,&#8221; publicists and reporters often came to an unspoken agreement featuring &#8220;exclusives and firsts taking a backseat to smarter analysis and better access.&#8221; According to several of Hollywood&#8217;s leading publicity honchos, however, this temporary standstill in the conflicting interests of the two groups no longer exists. Reporting on important film news related to the awards race during the actual season is now commonplace. An example of this occurred last year, when news stories regarding <em>The Hurt Locker</em> producer Nicolas Chartier being banned from attending the awards as a result of an email blasting <em>Avatar</em> quickly circulated throughout the industry in the runup to the Oscars.<span id="more-916"></span></p>
<p>The advent of online technology and the role it has played in journalism has played an enormous role in the development of this year-long news cycle. According to Steve Elzer, senior VP of media relations at Sony Pictures Entertainment, &#8220;there is no question that the proliferation of blogs and online journalism has put enormous new pressure on publicists and journals alike.&#8221; Bloggers and online journalists&#8217; sole goal is often to report on the events of the industry, and the advent of social networking websites like Twitter makes it quite easy to keep up with current events of the entertainment world on a minute-by-minute basis. Because of the constant access to the industry&#8217;s developments, publicists and journalists must now both be on guard and vigilant in their pursuits throughout the calendar year, no longer having a break during the so-called &#8220;awards season.&#8221; This change in the publicity &#8220;game&#8221; within the film industry is reflective of the demands of mainstream society as a whole. As more and more technologies come to the forefront, the demand for the newest information at any time and in multiple capacities has increased exponentially.</p>
<p>In terms of power roles, journalists and publicists both fit into the &#8220;facilitator&#8221; role. Publicists are facilitators of the promotion of their clients&#8217; images both to the public and the industry itself. Journalists can be considered facilitators, as well, because they must relay information about newsworthy material to the public. There is often a substantial divide between the goals of publicists and journalists, especially in the film industry, as both groups are facilitators but attempting to facilitate entirely different types of information. According to Stan Rosenfield, a personal publicist who has handled Oscar campaigns for clients such as George Clooney and Helen Mirren, &#8220;journalists want certain stories from us, and when they don&#8217;t get (them), they are not happy with us. But if you want to be good at what you do, you need to have a meaningful relationship with the press.&#8221; When two separate entities like publicists and journalists, who play the same power role have conflicting interests but often have to work together, a &#8220;co-dependency&#8221; often emerges in the film industry. As the Oscar season continues, this relationship is often necessary in order to establish the facilitation efforts of both parties.</p>

(2011, February 9 ). Paramount targeting Christian audiences with &#8216;Justin Bieber: Never Say   Never.&#8217; <em>Hollywood Reporter</em>. Retrieved from <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/paramount-targeting-christian-audiences-justin-97887" target="_blank">http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/paramount-targeting-christian-audiences-justin-97887</a></p>
<p>In case you have been living underneath a rock for the past two years, you have heard of &#8216;tween&#8217; singing sensation Justin Bieber. Attracting the hearts and minds of young girls in a way perhaps not seen since the heyday of &#8216;NSync and The Backstreet Boys, &#8220;Bieber fever&#8221; has covered the nation in a shockingly short amount of time. Aside from his millions of CDs sold, Paramount Pictures is hoping Bieber&#8217;s popularity will translate into cinematic success with this Friday&#8217;s release of the 3D &#8220;biopic-concert hybrid&#8221; <em>Justin Bieber: Never Say Never</em>. After the box office success of recent concert films like <em>Hannah Montana: Best of Both Worlds </em>(2008) and <em>Michael Jackson&#8217;s This Is It </em>(2009), studios have struck gold with this specific storytelling formula that attracts both film and music fans.</p>
<p>The trailer for the film can be viewed at this link:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COJCN3Mhr14">Never Say Never Official Trailer (HD)</a><span id="more-759"></span></p>
<p>A marketing technique that has gained prominence in the film industry in recent years involves targeting Christian religious communities. Recent successes of this technique have included Mel Gibson&#8217;s <em>The Passion of the Christ </em>(2004) and <em>The Blind Side </em>(2009). While <em>The Passion of the Christ</em> blatantly displayed its religious undertones and caused controversy as a result, <em>The Blind Side</em>&#8216;s thematic undertones of Christian beliefs brought a more subtle emphasis on faith and values. In an effort to appeal to Christians and religious groups, Paramount has recently held screenings of <em>Never Say Neve</em><em>r</em> for faith leaders and handed out spiritual discussion guides. According to an article in <em>The Hollywood Reporter</em>, these discussion guides makes the claim that the film &#8220;provides an opportunity to teach our children about the power of hope, prayer, faith and family.&#8221; One pastor who attended a screening of the film echoed this, saying that he wants to use the film as a discussion facilitator of &#8220;how authority and responsibility go hand in hand.&#8221;</p>
<p><!--more-->While it remains to be seen how well <em>Justin Bieber: Never Say Never</em> will perform at the box office, Paramount is hoping to expand its audience beyond a core market of tween girls. By targeting family-oriented groups through emphasizing the film&#8217;s religious aspects, the studio&#8217;s marketing team is praying for heavenly financial returns.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, January 25, the Academy Award nominations were announced in Hollywood. While many people wake up at the crack of dawn to see the nominees for the Oscars&#8217; biggest categories, one category that remains essential but is consistently overlooked is Best Film Editing. This year&#8217;s nominees are Jon Harris for &#8220;127 Hours,&#8221; Andrew Weisblum for &#8220;Black Swan,&#8221; Pamela Martin for &#8220;The Fighter,&#8221; Tariq Anwar for &#8220;The King&#8217;s Speech&#8221; and Angus Wall &amp; Kurt Baxter for &#8220;The Social Network.&#8221; What sets these nominees apart from past years is the complete reality of the nominated films that allows for audiences to become &#8220;totally immersed.&#8221; As more films are produced every year, an editor&#8217;s task becomes increasingly difficult as they must take innovative approaches to presenting films with familiar plot lines.</p>
<p><span id="more-710"></span>Although films are written by the screenwriter, a huge part of the creator power role relies on the abilities of the editor. Every shot seen by paying audiences is cut and pasted by those individuals. Their work, that like these nominees, is what capitalizes on the emotions of the audiences and continues to bring them into theaters even after the Academy Awards are over. The Academy Awards&#8217; role in the industry is the exhibitor. For instance, at last year&#8217;s Academy Awards the Best Picture category held 10 nominees instead of the usual 5 in order to have more people watch the show and generate higher profits for viewings afterward. This is a great benefit to the motion picture industry because even though it is only the category of Best Picture that&#8217;s expanded, the fruits of the editors labors will be appreciated as well.  <!--more--></p>
<p>Since editing is so crucial to a successful film, why don&#8217;t people usually know who editors are? Can you even name the editor of your favorite film? Most likely, you can probably name the actors, perhaps even the director and the screenwriter. However, being able to name a film&#8217;s editor is far less likely. Throughout film history, editors have served as the backbone of feature films, working to ensure that films come together in a way that allows for cinematic impacts. Since their roles are almost always in a behind the scenes capacity, editors have not been given the recognition they often deserve. During the Oscar telecast this year, it is likely the only editor viewers would see would be the actual winner, with a high probability of music cutting off their speech. Although it is the actors and advertisements that typically draw viewers to films in the first place, it is the work of the faceless people behind the scenes that keep the motion picture industry running. <!--more--></p>
<p>On Sunday, February 27, when you tune in for the Oscars, don&#8217;t tune out the editors.</p>
