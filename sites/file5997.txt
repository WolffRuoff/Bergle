			<p><em>Our second Spring Break report comes from women&#8217;s lacrosse co-captain Angela Napoletano in Hilton Head.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/wlax-springbreak5.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-934" title="women's lacrosse in Hilton Head" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/wlax-springbreak5.jpg" alt="" width="276" height="373" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/wlax-springbreak5.jpg 276w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/wlax-springbreak5-221x300.jpg 221w" sizes="(max-width: 276px) 100vw, 276px" /></a>After enduring a 13-hour-long bus ride, filled with eating, sleeping and some more eating, we finally arrived at the Sea Pines Resort in Hilton Head, South Carolina, at 6 p.m. on Saturday. Although the rain put a damper on unloading the bus, everyone on the team was very excited to be here and ran to their villas to pick their rooms. The team was split into three villas of about nine people each. Each villa was required to prepare a meal one night for everyone on the team. </p>
<p>Waking up early on Sunday morning was not as bad as everyone had expected it to be due to the anticipation of playing in the warm 70-degree weather. The fields of Hilton Head are definitely not the surface we are used to playing on. Barker Field, with its grass, dirt and mud terrain, made for an interesting adjustment to prepare for our game on Tuesday, but our team was up for the challenge. Needless to say, after a long two-hour practice in the heat, we were ready for a home-cooked meal.</p>

<p>The picture does not even show all of the compartments under the bus that contained the food we bought, but going shopping allows us to have all the food we want for the week.  For dinner, my villa chose to make baked ziti with garlic bread and salad along with a birthday cake for the newly 21 year old Alexandra Franck.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/wlax-springbreak1.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-929" title="women's lacrosse in Hilton Head" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/wlax-springbreak1.jpg" alt="" width="271" height="363" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/wlax-springbreak1.jpg 271w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/wlax-springbreak1-223x300.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 271px) 100vw, 271px" /></a>After being in Hilton Head last year for Spring Break, we knew all of the good spots we had to go back to visit. Besides our Bieber bus, our only method of transportation around the island was rented bikes. Being that all of us are between the ages of 18 and 22, one would think that we know how to ride a bike. However, that was not the case for sophomore Veronica Maccia. Unfortunately, she did not make it through our first bike ride on the island in one piece after falling off and scraping up her knees, hands and toes. She has the evidence to prove it with multiple scrapes and bruises.</p>
<p>The Salty Dog was a favorite among our team last year and the restaurant and shops were at the top of the list to go back to, where everyone either purchased a sweatshirt, long sleeve, hat or tank with the Salty Dog logo on it.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/wlax-springbreak3.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-931" title="women's lacrosse in Hilton Head" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/wlax-springbreak3.jpg" alt="" width="194" height="261" /></a>Although the Salty Dog was enjoyed by everyone, we knew the next day we had to get focused in order to win the game we came down here to play. We knew going into the game that it was going to be good competition against regional rivals Eastern University. The beginning seemed grim as we got off to a slow start, allowing Eastern to score in the first 30seconds of the game. At halftime we were up 8-7, but we knew we needed to make a lot of changes to win this game. We came out in the second half holding Eastern to three goals while we stepped up and rattled off five straight goals to solidify the win. After a game with multiple fouls and rough play we were proud to come out with the win. Knowing that we came down to Hilton Head on a 13-hour bus ride to play this one game gave us incentive to play without regrets and put everything out on the field.</p>
<p>The celebration of our win came to a sudden halt when we discovered that the “Muhlen-plague” had followed us to South Carolina. Unfortunately seven of us were unable to practice and be outside in the beautiful weather with the rest of our team. As I sit here writing this blog with Kaitlyn McCaffrey, the rest of our team is out enjoying a hibachi dinner, which has nothing on our Gatorade and saltine cracker diet.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/wlax-springbreak4.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-932" title="women's lacrosse in Hilton Head" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/wlax-springbreak4.jpg" alt="" width="259" height="365" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/wlax-springbreak4.jpg 259w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/wlax-springbreak4-212x300.jpg 212w" sizes="(max-width: 259px) 100vw, 259px" /></a>This image of the lighthouse in Harbor Town will be forever embedded in our minds, especially on our long bus ride home on Friday. While we are sad to leave the beautiful Hilton Head, we need to focus on the rest of our season. The stomach bug won’t keep us down for long because when we come back to Allentown, we have our home opener Wednesday against Lebanon Valley, and our first conference game against F&amp;M Saturday. Even though we had great experiences here we are excited to return back to Muhlenberg to continue our success as a team. HEE HAA HOO HAA, GO BERG!</p>

<p>With the only goalie on last year’s Muhlenberg women’s lacrosse team a senior, the Mules knew they would need to find someone to fill the void in the cage this spring.</p>
<p>So when then-sophomore Tiffany Kreider heard the news from some of her friends on the team, she volunteered her duties.</p>
<p>Well, kind of.</p>
<p>“It was always kind of a joke,” she said. “They said they needed a goalie, and I said,<br />
‘Well I’ll do it.’ But I never really thought it would actually happen. Then one day I went out and took some shots, and I’ve been hooked.”</p>
<p>Kreider, who played on the field hockey team her first two years at Muhlenberg, had just a small understanding of lacrosse as a senior at Mifflinburg High School in central Pennsylvania.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/kreider.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-906" title="Tiffany Kreider" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/kreider.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="485" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/kreider.jpg 240w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/kreider-148x300.jpg 148w" sizes="(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px" /></a>The Wildcats did not get a team until 2009, when, ironically, current Muhlenberg assistant coach Cindy Wilson helped form a team while she was a senior at nearby Susquehanna University.</p>
<p>But Kreider stuck to field hockey and never tried her hand at lacrosse. That is until her friends on the team said they were in need of a goalie.</p>
<p>Flash forward 10 months, and there was Kreider taking her place between the pipes for yesterday&#8217;s season opener at Widener.</p>
<p>And while she said she had no idea what to expect, she was immediately thrust into a tough spot.</p>
<p>Facing a free-position shot less than 10 minutes in, she got enough of her stick on the ball to send it flying harmlessly away for the first save of her career.</p>
<p>That one save was enough to boost her confidence, and from there she soared.</p>
<p>Kreider stopped nine of the Pride’s 12 shots on goal to help the Mules pick up a 15-3 win. She turned away three shots from point-blank range and two more on fastbreak opportunities.</p>
<p>“I was really nervous, but this wasn’t just about one person,” Kreider said. “It’s a team game, and my teammates did a great job of keeping them away from the goal. All I have to do is make sure I’m in front of the ball, and with the way the rest of the defense played, that was easy.”</p>
<p>To anyone unfamiliar with the situation, she would have looked like a natural who has been playing the game her entire life.</p>
<p>But her teammates were not surprised in the least. They’ve seen her aggressiveness and tenacity from the first day of practice and think she has all the makings of a rock-solid keeper. And, more importantly, the perfect fit for the Mules.</p>
<p>“It’s incredible how quickly she’s picked it up,” said senior Angela Napoletano. “She’s been impressive since the first day of practice. She has no fear, and I can’t wait to see what she does next.”</p>

			<p><em>The Centennial Conference hosted the 13th annual Snell-Shillingford Symposium at Haverford last weekend. Female athlete representatives and coaches from the conference’s member schools participated in sessions designed to empower women in the coaching profession and to encourage them to take up the legacy of those who have gone before them.</em></p>
<p><em>Muhlenberg was represented at the three-day event by two coaches, Cindy Wilson (assistant lacrosse) and Rhonwen Peters (assistant field hockey), who attended as a presenter and mentor, respectively, and two </em><em>senior athletes, Davi Gordon (volleyball) and Jessica Shegoski (lacrosse).</em></p>
<p><em>Here is what Gordon had to say about her experience:</em></p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/gordonhs2.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-67" title="Davi Gordon" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/gordonhs2.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>… Students and coaches from each school in the Centennial Conference attended this all-female conference to learn, share and present about women in sports and coaching. Various coaches and representatives from the conference presented about the history of Title IX, the different responsibilities a coach may have, creating a practice and season plan, developing a coaching philosophy, and sportsmanship and ethics in coaching.</p>
<p>I wanted to attend this symposium because I have a passion for volleyball, and with graduation quickly approaching, I know that I want to continue to keep the sport as a major part of my life. Although I’m not sure what level I ultimately want to coach, this conference definitely confirmed my desire to coach volleyball in the future.  I have had some great (and not so good) coaches in the past, and I think that my coaches have helped me develop into the person I am today. I would love to be able to have the same impact on other girls, and being able to see their progress will be very rewarding!</p>
<p><em>And Shegoski gave this insight into the Symposium:</em></p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/02/shegoskihs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-781" title="Jessica Shegoski" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/02/shegoskihs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>The Snell-Shillingford Symposium is a weekend full of education and fun. I attended the Symposium because I have always had a love for coaching and teaching a sport I love to other girls. It’s a great feeling to see their eyes light up when they master a new concept and fall in love with the game. This is also the reason that I am considering a career coaching either at the college or high school level.</p>
<p>I learned so much throughout the weekend, not only about sports and females, but also about myself.</p>
<p>During one of the sessions, presented by the Bryn Mawr soccer coach Erin DeMarco, we did a personality test that grouped you into colors (Davi, Cindy and I were Blues). These colors gave insight into our personalities; there were the builders, the planners, the realtors and the adventurers. Erin then let us know how each of these personalities got along during a LONG road trip.</p>
<p>The builders were the one who had already loaded the directions into the GPS that was of course already set up on the dash, read the directions a couple times online, printed out the Google Maps version of the directions, and just in case none of those worked packed the 50 state atlas in the back of the car. They also have already mapped out the trip down the minute (including bathroom stops).</p>
<p>The planners are the ones at the hood of the car with the atlas spread out. They are looking at the route printed by the builders and thinking to themselves “well what if we instead took this road, it would add 10 minutes but we would hit traffic, or this road we wouldn’t have to pay a toll but again more mileage.” The planners are not going to be ready to leave until every possibility is looked over.</p>
<p>Then there are the relators (Davi, Cindy and I). We are the “moms” of the group, and we are already sitting in the car with a snack packed for each person in the group, making sure that no one is hungry and trying to find out how everyone’s day is going so far, while at the same time trying to make sure everyone is comfortable for the long trip ahead.</p>
<p>Lastly, there are the adventurers. These are your friends who are always last minute (you know you are thinking of that person right now). They come running up the driveway two minutes before the builder has planned to leave (pan to the builder constantly checking their watch), throwing their duffel into the trunk and screaming, “road trip here we come.”</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/02/snell_symposium.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-782" title="Snell Symposium" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/02/snell_symposium.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="223" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/02/snell_symposium.jpg 450w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/02/snell_symposium-300x148.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a>As we sat and listened to Erin describe this scenario we all realized that we were the person that she was describing and that we could place our teammates and friends into the other roles, which helped us to learn the best ways to work within a team and thrive as a team.</p>
<p>Overall the Symposium was a fun, long, amazing weekend that I would tell any female athlete in the Centennial Conference to attend if they even have the slightest draw towards coaching in the future. And that doesn’t mean you have to want to coach at the college or high school level &#8211; the pee wee leagues matter just as much.</p>
<p><em>The above picture of Shegoski (in pink sweater) and Gordon (to her right) at one of the sessions was taken by a former Muhlenberg Symposium attendee &#8211; Jamie Gluck &#8217;03, head women&#8217;s soccer coach at Haverford.</em></p>

<p>Saturday morning the men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s lacrosse teams participated in the annual 5K Race for Freedom in the Lehigh Valley Parkway. This race is held in memory of Ashly Moyer, a 21-year-old Lehigh Valley native who was serving in the War in Iraq. Ashly was killed in action when an IED, better known as a roadside bomb, exploded under her armored vehicle in March 2007.</p>
<p>Ashly was the 21st person from Lehigh Valley and the 71st female service member to die since the war began. Every year the team participates in the event as an act of community service.</p>
<p>Being from the Lehigh Valley, the race has a more profound meaning for me. Celebrating the life of someone my age and from my area who died while fighting for our freedom in another country, let alone in another hemisphere, is something you don&#8217;t really think about as a college student. It&#8217;s something you never think about unless it directly affects you. Other things are on your mind at this age, like, &#8220;when is that 10-page paper due?&#8221; Or, &#8220;where is the big party this Saturday?&#8221;</p>
<p>And then, on the day of this race, you start to think of other questions that soldiers face &#8230; the ones that you normally would never think of &#8230; the ones like, &#8220;am I going to have enough ammunition in case of a firefight?&#8221; or &#8220;am I ever going to see my family again?&#8221; You quickly realize that the 10-page paper and big party aren&#8217;t really that important anymore. The questions and &#8220;problems&#8221; we face here don&#8217;t compare to the questions and problems that our armed forces face, especially when deployed.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to moan and groan over waking up early on a Saturday morning to run a 5K. What&#8217;s not so easy is leaving your family, friends and home to fight and protect the freedoms we enjoy. And on Saturday morning, we partook in the celebration of a soldier who gave the ultimate sacrifice for her country.</p>
