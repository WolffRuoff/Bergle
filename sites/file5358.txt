								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><em>EDITOR&#8217;S NOTE</em>: Vernon Jordan III is a member of the 2013 SDP ensemble. This post was composed in late August &#8217;13 just after the Sedehi Diversity Project&#8217;s encore performance for the Muhlenberg community. It&#8217;s being published here for the first time.</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a week since I took the stage to enlighten, expose, and educate the Muhlenberg College community around issues of diversity &#8211; and I simply can&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s over. This summer, because of the Diversity Project, among other things, turned out to be very powerful &#8211; dare I say, personal?</p>
<p>At the last talk-back with audience members and the ensemble, someone asked: &#8220;(I.)Why did you get involved with this project? (II.)And what do you want us as an audience to take away?&#8221; My answer lies here.</p>
<p>I. I initially got involved with the project (aka auditioning) because, well, how could I not? Last year, when the uprising around these issues sparked up around MLK day I became very involved &#8211; quickly and not so quietly. For me, this was personal; and at the same time I was learning I wasn&#8217;t the only one who faced discrimination, loneliness and a sense of unease on this campus. I knew that in addition to my role in multicultural organizations on campus, the wonderful experience I had in Memphis last semester, and the classes I took, that this would be a grand opportunity to do some further learning, and further growing. Â This project was powerful to me, the project spoke to me &#8211; and I could not deny that. I felt like it was linked to my path here at Muhlenberg, and as I discovered during performances of the piece, it&#8217;s linked and connected to a large number of our paths here on Muhlenberg&#8217;s campus. The diversity project was an avenue for me to be vocal &#8211; and a lot more truthfully than in normal circumstances. Lastly, the project is itself an intersection of Art and Activism &#8211; something that is very real and very true. So to be involved with a project that straddles on both of those lines &#8211; again, how could I not?</p>
<p>II. Â I wanted the audience to leave the performances of the piece challenged. And not only challenged, but motivated, fired-up, shocked, and ready to do something about the collision of ideas, conflict, identities and, honestly, emotion that actually happens on this campus as a result of its current systematic state. Ultimately, how I felt throughout the process (like I had to rethink a couple of things, maybe read a dictionary or two, like I needed to be open to opinions and beliefs I wasn&#8217;t used to, like I needed to spread this information around as opposed to letting it sit in my experience and in my brain, like I needed to continue to work and push for social justice), I wanted that replicated in the audience. If I, as an ensemble member, learned so much throughout the process, then you guys as audience members &#8211; the folks we intended on teaching and showing &#8211; should DEFINITELY had walked away with something new, something scary, something challenging to your world (whatever personal lens you live inside).</p>
<p>***The diversity project was a wonderful time for me, especially considering I&#8217;m the youngest member of this year&#8217;s ensemble and a lot newer to the Muhlenberg community than some of my fellow ensemble members. I will say this: the avenues in which you, as a student, can learn and be involved are numerous &#8211; so if you&#8217;re a student here reading this, freshman or not, GET INVOLVED! Talk to someone. Open your eyes (don&#8217;t be afraid to be wrong). Recognize your Power &#8211; and dammit use it! If you&#8217;re attending this institution, which prides itself in students being<em> &#8220;independent critical thinkers who are knowledgeable about the achievements and traditions of diverse civilizations and cultures, able to express ideas with clarity and grace, committed to life-long learning&#8221;Â </em> then we, you, and myself &#8211; the student body! &#8211; best start acting like it.Â Our work is not done.</p>

<p>we&#8217;ve just finished our VERY LAST DAY OF INTERVIEWS!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m psyched for what&#8217;s to come.</p>
<p>And saying I&#8217;m psyched about getting our scripts by the end of this week, and beginning to create the actual script and the work, is an understatement!</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t wait for you guys to get to know the final product&#8230;well, because we, ourselves, don&#8217;t know the final product. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="ðŸ˜‰" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>But it will be great. You&#8217;ll learn a lot. We&#8217;re learning a lot. I promise.</p>
