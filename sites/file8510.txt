								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Social Media is a lethal weapon. When hearing this statement some people might be puzzled trying to figure out what it might mean. Although people may feel that social media is amazing for its ability to give each person who it is accessible to a voice, this is far from the case. Facebook and Twitter, two of the most popular social networking sites that we use in our everyday lives are flooded with terroristic propaganda used to help benefit various terrorist organizations. A book published by the United States government titled, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">The Evolution of Terrorist Propaganda: The Paris Attack and Social Media, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> talks about the growing concern over terrorist organizations’ ability to use social media. The book continues to talk about the knowledge that terrorist organizations have as it says, “Terrorists know the benefit of social media. Social Media is easy to use, it is free, and it reaches everyone in the world,”(1). ISIS , who has recently come into view for the United States government and its citizens, uses social media to broadcast their horrible videos that show their terrible acts to the entire world. ISIS uses these videos in an attempt to recruit new members to their “caliphate” not just in the Middle East, but around the world due to the abilities of social media. With a growing terrorist organization presence on Twitter and Facebook, these companies and the United States are faced with a huge dilemma. Should they do whatever it takes to remove all the content posted by terrorist organizations to prevent recruitment or should they leave the content so they can use it for intelligence to help stop the terrorist organizations. The United States and Social Media companies must figure out a strategy to help improve this issue. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As the reading continues, it talks about occurrences where terrorist groups have used social media. Twitter has run into major problems with terrorist groups being on their website such as, “for years Twitter was asked to shut down an account of the foreign terrorist organization al- Shabaab, which pledged allegiance to al-Qaeda,”(2). In 2013, al-Shabaab’s account live tweeted their attack on the Westgate Mall in Kenya that killed 72 people. By Twitter not listening to these complaints, they let a terrorist organization live tweet so the rest of the world was able to see , which could have easily been prevented by Twitter. The reading continued to talk about the negatives of social media saying, “the use of Internet to radicalize and recruit homegrown terrorists is the single most important and dangerous innovation since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Approaches that are aimed at reducing the supply of violent extremist content on the Internet are neither feasible nor desirable.’’ The United States and other nations know that they are fighting a very tough battle against terrorists organization on social networking websites. In my opinion, these sites should look to eliminate every terrorist affiliated page. ISIS’ main strength is its ability to recruit and send messages using social media. I feel that if companies like Facebook and Twitter could cut off ISIS’ ability to use social media, their efforts would be extremely weakened. Having information about terrorist organizations like ISIS by using their posts can be beneficial, but the United States has been very good at knowing where and when ISIS mobilizes and with drone technology they are able to attack without sending military personnel to the battlefield to fight. United States citizens have also began to try to join the ISIS caliphate. Many of these people have been caught before being able to travel to Syria to join, but some have been successful in their efforts. Social media is the reason for this willingness to join ISIS. The United States and social networking websites have made strides to help put an end to terrorist organization’s ability to share their ideas and messages with the world,  but it will be a long, hard battle that the United States and the rest of the world will continue to fight.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Facebook is just another one of the countless forms of social media that my generation uses to see what their “friends” are doing. One’s news feed is the endless list that updates itself as people upload new content. These news feeds encompass status updates, pictures, and even articles that people like and share. The problem with Facebook occurs when users accept friend requests from people they don&#8217;t actually know. Now these strangers have access to not only personal pictures, but personal information.</p>
<p>Robert Lemieux, a professor in the communication department at McDaniel College, conducted a study about privacy on Facebook. His participants had to construct a fictitious profile with the name Jamie Marple and a profile picture showing both a girl and a boy. The name Jamie was chosen because of the possibility that it could fit either gender. The only other information on the profile aside from the name and the extremely vague picture, was “Jamie’s” date of birth and hometown. “Since the study’s primary interest was to test the likelihood of being accepted as a friend based on limited, personal information, Jamie’s personal information was severely limited” (Lemieux, 2012). Another group of participants within the study were informed to friend Jamie and write on her profile. This made it look like Jamie was real and active user.</p>
<p>The entire purpose of Lemieux’s study was to see if people would accept a friend request from a person with a questionable profile that they really did not know. The results proved that kids are willing to accept friend requests from even the profiles that have meager amounts of information. “Results indicated that 325 Facebook members (72% of the sample) willingly accepted the friendship of the unknown individual” (Lemieux, 2012). More than 50% of Facebook users were willing to welcome a new friendship despite knowing such a minute amount of information about them.</p>
<p>What’s the issue with this? Why is it so bad to casually accept a friend request on Facebook? You see that you have some mutual friends with this persons so it must not be a big deal. Many problems however could come along with the spontaneous action of accepting anyone and everyone. Not only is your privacy in jeopardy, but your security is too. Once accepting that friend request, the person on the other side of the computer has access to very personal information like where you live or where you go to school. They can also see pictures that you post, and pictures other people post of you. One day someone unwanted could find out where you live or the wrong person could see you at a party holding a beer. Would you want that?</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A selfie,“A self portrait photograph, typically taken with a digital camera or a camera phone held by the hand or supported by a selfie stick” (Selfie, 2015). All people, whether they want to admit it or not, have taken a selfie at one point in their life. It may have been for their followers on Instagram, or maybe to their best friend on Snapchat. Regardless of the recipient or the purpose, the selfie was still taken.</p>
<p>The world may think the selfie was introduced only a few years ago, but in reality the concept is ancient. The first selfie was technically taken in 1839 by famous photographer, Robert Cornelius. He used the first photographic process, known as daguerreotypy. This process however was much different from the selfie today. The photographer figured out that the process was so slow that he could start the camera, enter the frame, and then exit the frame (Selfie, 2015). Essentially, he was able to take a self portrait by himself. As time went on, the selfie continued to evolve. “The debut of the portable Kodak brownie box camera in 1900 led to photographic self portrait  becoming a more widespread technique” (Selfie, 2015). The photographer would position themselves in front of a mirror to capture their self portrait.</p>
<p>The selfie that we have grown to know started off as the typical Myspace picture. &#8220;An amateurish, flash-blinded self-portrait, often taken in front of a bathroom mirror” (Selfie, 2015). However these mirror pictures didn’t last forever. Once Facebook began overshadowing Myspace, the concept had morphed once again. User’s selfies were becoming more classy and well planned out. Digital cameras and camera phones were now obsolete due to the new technologies that housed front facing cameras.</p>
<p>Selfies were taken to a whole new level. They started out as just a profile picture on a social media site and evolved into a daily act for a lot of people. Well planned selfies are taken to get on likes on Instagram, ugly selfies are taken to send to friends on Snapchat, and group selfies are taken to capture memories. In just a few short years, the idea of the selfie we knew exploded. “The popularity of selfies in social media has been astounding. Instagram has over 53 million photos tagged with the hashtag #selfie. The word ‘selfie’ was mentioned in Facebook status updates over 368,000 times during a one-week period in October 2013. During the same period on Twitter, the hashtag #selfie was used in more than 150,000 tweets” (Selfie, 2015).</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In today’s society, I think that it is safe to say that we can’t live without the Internet. Through using the Internet, we have access right at our fingertips to news, social media, and numerous search engines such as Google and Yahoo. Since we can so easily access the Internet, sources like the newspaper are becoming less important. Anything we come across in the newspaper, chances are we will be able to find on the Internet faster.</p>
<p>An incredible social media tool that the Internet provides us access to is Facebook. It has been in existence for just over ten years now, and is the most popular social media website, attracting more than 1.49 billion users (Reddy, 2015). Facebook also allows us to view news, more specifically though, news that typically targets human interest. The Internet is “increasingly impacting all spheres of life across the world” (Reddy, 2015). It is coming to a point where people are becoming dependent on Facebook, and some people want to get connected to the Internet solely so that they can become active on Facebook. Before the Internet, not only did we not have access to Facebook, but we also relied heavily on resources such as newspapers, magazines, and radio to find out information. Google and Facebook are continually becoming more popularized in today’s society since they contain such a significant amount of information and serve as such a beneficial tool in our daily lives. It is said that “Facebook and Google will continue to dominate the online space” (Reddy, 2015). Both tools wouldn’t have been made possible without the Internet. The Internet now allows us to search for potential jobs, conduct research, connect with people nationwide, and so much more. It is because of reasons like these that Facebook and Google will continue to dominate our online world and keep us coming back. Having access to so many incredible tools myself in today’s society, it is hard to imagine what life would be like without the Internet. In conclusion, the ways in which we benefit from Internet access in today’s society are endless. This generation has brought us more technological resources than ever before.</p>
