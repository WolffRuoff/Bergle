								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After today&#8217;s showing for the RAs and SAs, a gentlemen asked us why each of us members of the cast wanted to be a part of SDP and what we hope the incoming freshmen, and anyone else who watches us, learn from the performance.  And here is my response.</p>
<p>When I first saw information about auditions for this year&#8217;s Diversity Project, I wasn&#8217;t completely sure if I wanted to go for it or not.  It wasn&#8217;t until later on that I realized how much I needed to audition and be a part of this process.  Last semester I was taking three classes in which they all discussed racial issues in education and the dance community.  These conversations mainly focused on racial issues between black and white.  As a half white, half Asian woman I became so frustrated by this.  In all my educational years, there is so little mentioned about Asian Americans in a historical and current context, so why should I be so shocked that this was still the case in college.  I realized in that moment that by not at least auditioning for SDP I was risking the possibility of an Asian American&#8217;s voice not being heard.  I became sick and tired of being left out, of being cast aside as not important, not a concern when that is the precise reason why it IS a concern.  By being part of this process I can assure that the issues faced by Asian Americans on campus are brought to light and included.  Now that we&#8217;re at the very end of this project, I can gladly say that I think I did my part and I&#8217;m very happy that this particular concern was addressed.</p>
<p>As for what I hope students, faculty, administration, etc. learn from this year&#8217;s performance.  Well I hope they understand that there is, in fact, a problem concerning diversity on our campus and that they see it as more than just a passing sentiment.  I want them to care and be concerned with the issue just as much as I am.  I don&#8217;t want people to be afraid to feel uncomfortable but understand that feeling uncomfortable is okay.  These discussions are hard especially the realizations and truths that come to light as a part of it.  But I think there is a brighter light at the end of the tunnel and what I hope is that people understand how much of a disservice is being done to the Muhlenberg Community by lacking diversity and lacking these sorts of discussions.  I want people to care; I want people to want to care.  I also want our audiences to realize that their general conceptions and supposed knowledge of the issues and concerns are not enough.  Things need to change on this campus, and yes the state of America in relation to this isn&#8217;t perfect either, but I think Muhlenberg may just be a bit behind as well.  It&#8217;s time for Muhlenberg to &#8220;wake up&#8221;.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This past Tuesday was our first time performing in front of an audience.  The audience consisted of current Muhlenberg students who will be facilitating the discussions that will be held after each show for the Freshmen this weekend.  Yesterday, Wednesday, however, was our first performance in front of freshmen.  It was a very specific freshmen group &#8211; the athletes &#8211; and overall I think it went very well!</p>
<p>Personally, I found there to be a noticeable difference between the two performances.  The first one found the audience responding with laughter to some of the lines in our script, much more so than the second performance.  This isn&#8217;t necessarily a good or bad thing but there was definitely a difference and I think this difference is important in the ensemble&#8217;s understanding of who exactly our audience this weekend will be.</p>
<p>The facilitators in the first performance were all upperclassmen and also students who have either been in the Diversity Project in previous years or are already involved in these sorts of conversations on diversity in some way.  Basically they are &#8220;on the inside&#8221;, they already know and understand, to some extent, the issues of diversity that are happening on our campus currently.   The freshmen athletes were &#8220;on the outside&#8221;, meaning that this was, for the most part, the first time they were introduced to this subject matter and the accompanying issues.  This explains why some of the &#8220;hilarity&#8221; wasn&#8217;t as easily visible for them because they don&#8217;t quite understand as they had yet a chance to participate in such discussions .  Although some of us in the Diversity Project first thought this lack of responsiveness to be synonymous to iciness and not being receptive, we later discovered from the facilitators that they all actually had a lot to say in their discussions.  It goes to show the fact that when you&#8217;re introduced to these issues surrounding diversity, it takes some time to process &#8211; and that&#8217;s okay!  As an ensemble I think we learned to not take the audience&#8217;s reaction so personally.</p>
<p>I think this past performance really set us up for how this weekend will be and allowed us to learn and understand that this performance isn&#8217;t about freshmen &#8220;getting it&#8221;.  It&#8217;s meant to work as a starting point for people to be introduced to and invited into the conversation.  And I think we&#8217;ve accomplished just that.</p>

<p>Rehearsal started at 6pm Friday August 9th and we did not rest until it was finished&#8230;..at 8am Saturday August 10th.  Is this considered dedication or insanity?</p>
<p>Although it was a somewhat grueling process, we were fortunate to not come across any truly difficult arguments amongst us.  That being said I think I can speak for the entire cast when I say that cutting some of the various sections and conversations was somewhat heart-breaking and disappointing.  Overall, however, I think we were successful and I&#8217;m looking forward to getting started memorizing our lines and really getting into rehearsing and preparing for the performances!</p>

<p>Now Vernon, Ben, and myself stayed up &#8217;til 8am that previous night/morning? and only received about 4-6 hours asleep.  I was particularly impressed with myself.  I didn&#8217;t wake up until 12:50! That&#8217;s so late for me and I felt so unproductive!  Unfortunately it looks like another late night&#8230;</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wednesday, July 31st &#8212; Day 3</p>
<p>Oh what a night!</p>
<p>It starts with us attempting to navigate our way through Allentown towards <em>Spice India</em>, a relatively local and authentic Indian restaurant. Ultimately the lesson from that experience was: how many college students does it take to read a GPS? Far too many.</p>
<p>Once at the restaurant we enjoyed some delicious Indian cuisine but the real fun came when the check arrived. The first time we attempted to split the check we didn&#8217;t obtain enough money (around $30 under), the second attempt resulted in far too much money in the pile (around $15 over), the third time was the charm luckily&#8230;.but pathetically. The whole ordeal took about 15 minutes or so and you would think with two math majors in the group we would have been more successful. Lesson from that experience: Next time, split the check.</p>
<p>Rehearsal was by large a success as we went through seven transcripts. By this I mean we went through the transcriptions of seven interviews and chose/debated over what transcribed portions we wanted in the script and took out the parts we did not.</p>
<p>Although I was surprised about the general lack of heated debates over keeping some of them, I have feeling that this is only the beginning and I am actually looking forward to these arguments. Great, constructive arguments can only lead to a better product and I am so excited to see what we have by the end of all of this.</p>
