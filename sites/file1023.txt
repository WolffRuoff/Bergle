Starting this summer, books, periodicals, and journals will be co-located alongside each other by Dewey call number.<\/p>\n<p>For years, our library collection has been organized as most academic libraries have been, with reference books in one location, periodicals in another, and circulating books in yet another. While expert users of the library knew about these three disparate locations, novice users were often confused by the distinction. For example, more than a few users have wandered through the reference stacks, assuming the circulating title they were looking for could be found there, only to be redirected some time later to the &#8220;main collection.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Enter co-location. Co-location highlights one of the best features of the library: the chance for library users to browse and serendipitously discover information&#8211;reference works, circulating titles, or periodicals&#8211;all in one place.<\/p>\n<p>The move toward co-location is not entirely new. Some larger academic libraries long ago moved periodicals alongside circulating titles sharing a subject. For example, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill for many years has filed literature criticism periodicals with books of literary criticism (the Henry James Review is found adjacent to books about Henry James, etc.).<\/p>\n<p>This is all to say that Trexler Library has decided, after much deliberation, to follow the lead of many other academic libraries in co-locating print titles (periodicals, reference, circulating). This summer we are in the midst of the change. Please pardon the confusion, as this is a work in progress.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>Conflict Between Academic Presses and the Association of Research Libraries<\/strong><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Earlier this week, Kelly Cannon, Scholarly Communication Librarian at Trexler Library, attended a conference in Baltimore hosted by the Center for Intellectual Property (CIP). CIP has for several years running hosted some of the best conferences on the subject of copyright, trademarks, and patents. This year proved to be no different.<\/p>\n<p>One of the highlights of the conference was the marked disagreement that surfaced between academic presses and the Association of Research Libraries (ARL). ARL recently authored its groundbreaking\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.arl.org\/pp\/ppcopyright\/codefairuse\/code\/index.shtml\">Code of Best Practices in Fair Use for Academic and Research Libraries<\/a>. One voice for academic presses at the conference, Richard Brown, from Georgetown University, generally applauded the ARL best practices document, but took issue with the section of the document that addresses &#8220;Supporting Teaching and Learning with Access to Library Materials via Digital Technologies.&#8221; This section of the ARL document contends that e-reserves of academic press books and the like (other than textbooks) can be considered transformative insofar as students in a given course are a new and unintended audience for the work.<\/p>\n<p>Brown argued eloquently and passionately against ARL&#8217;s reasoning, saying that e-reserves (Blackboard, etc.) do not constitute a transformative use because the intended audience of academic press books is any member of the academy, including students. In that way, digitizing an academic press book and posting to Blackboard cannot be considered transformative.<\/p>\n<p>This is significant, in that transformative use has in recent years become a key factor in fair use determination by the courts. In the recent Georgia State ruling, the judge determined that e-reserves were not transformative. So Brown is really echoing that court decision in his comments.<\/p>\n<p>It remains to be seen whether ARL will modify its best practices document. Given the manner in which speakers like Patricia Aufderheide of American University (co-author of the ARL document and Director of the Center for Social Media) inveighed against Brown, any change is unlikely.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>Infomaniac Tip<\/strong><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><em><strong>Have You Tried Flipboard?<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/flipboard\/id358801284?mt=8\">Flipboard<\/a>\u00a0is an iPad and iPhone social magazine app that won accolades as the best app of 2011.
