								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Without a doubt, technology has made an incredible impact on the lives of young adults in such an extensive amount of ways. Additionally, &#8220;technology has certainly transformed our libraries. Public Internet access is available at almost every public library, even the smallest and most rural&#8221; (Walter &amp; Myers, 2003, p.50). Young adults have grown up in such a rapidly changing technological era that they automatically expect to see computers when they visit the library, and librarians in return expect to see teens actively using the computers. A recent study funded by the Pew Charitable Trust found that at least 78% of all young people between the ages of twelve and seventeen go online for school or personal use (Walter &amp; Myers, 2003). The number of homes with computers and Internet access has grown significantly over the last several years so much to the point that students themselves are concerned about the digital divide. At times, it can be difficult to be forced to rely on home computers for school assignments, and computers may not always be adequate for purposes of certain assignments (Walter &amp; Myers, 2003).</p>
<p>In an effort to try to keep up with the constant developments of new technologies, public libraries have started providing technologically savvy homework helpers who can accommodate teens&#8217; need for information and their preference for digital media. Young adults have found that the Internet not only assists with communication amongst friends and family, but they also feel that the Internet gives them a broader voice (Walter &amp; Myers, 2003). &#8220;Through electronic discussion lists and chat rooms, they can speak and listen to a far more diverse community than they can in their own geographical neighborhoods&#8221; (Walter &amp; Myers, 2003, p.50).</p>
<p>Since the Internet provides users with unlimited access to information, it is so important to be careful of how you use the Internet. As mentioned in several Ted Talks and in articles discussed in class in regards to privacy, especially now in the digital age, it is becoming more important than ever to be cognizant of what you are searching, downloading, and signing up for. With that in mind, young adults deserve the right to prove themselves as being responsible Internet users until a problem occurs. The Internet is such a useful, convenient, tool, it just needs to be used for appropriate purposes.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is no surprise that young adults spend more time with media and technology daily than any other activity. &#8220;It has been reported that young adults spend between 11 and 12 hours a day with technology and media&#8221; (Vaterlaus, Patten, Roche, Young 2015). Along with this, young adulthood has been said to be a risky time period for the development of poor diet and exercise habits (Vaterlaus et al. 2015). There are several factors that influence health behaviors, and it is predicted that social media could be a relevant factor in contributing to a person&#8217;s diet. Some of the considerations in making food choices include time availability and convenience (Vaterlaus et al. 2015). Interestingly enough, it is said that television may play a role in people&#8217;s dietary choices mainly due to food related advertisements. The connection with this is that when young adults watch advertisements about food, a lot of times unhealthy foods, it is likely that they could become hungry and add unnecessary snacks to their diet (Vaterlaus et al. 2015).</p>
<p>A research study was conducted in an effort to determine more specific influences of social media on young adult health behaviors. The sample consisted of young adults that were recruited from five courses at a midwestern university in the United States. The results of the survey showed that the majority of participants felt that social media does have an influence on young adult health behaviors. Three main themes appeared to be the main influences on the young adult experience with social media which are social media as a motivator and barrier to exercise, the perceived connection between food and social media, and the impact of posting pictures of food online (Vaterlaus et al. 2015).</p>
<p>Participants concluded that social media could be &#8220;both a motivator and a barrier to exercise in young adulthood&#8221; (Vaterlaus et al. 2015). As a motivator, social media provides specific apps like Nike+ and Map My Run to track progress on work outs. This feature increases accountability, and leads to physical improvement. As a barrier, participants felt that social media could become a distraction during exercise. An example of this would be a phone vibrating signaling a text message or other notification. Participants also reported that social media is associated with increased food choices, especially with applications like Pinterest, people can search for any kind of recipe they could ever want. However, people felt that constantly posting pictures of food online makes people more hungry, and therefore tempted to eat (Vaterlaus et al. 2015).</p>
<p>&#8220;Social media was perceived to be a distraction that could lead to (a) disconnection during meal times and (b) making poor food choices&#8221; (Vaterlaus et al. 2015). In this sense, participants explained that now people spend their meal times on their cell phone instead of conversing with those around them. Poor food choices are also more likely to be made because people are more interested in what is on their phone and may not pay attention to what they are eating, causing them to consume a lot more than planned.</p>
<p>Social media as both a motivator and barrier to exercise, the perceived connection between food and social media, and the impact of posting pictures of food online all connect because they each have some kind of impact on young adults&#8217; health. I felt that an article like this tied in well with class discussions and course readings because of how often we talk about social media and its various impacts.</p>
<p>I found this research study to be very fascinating, though I can&#8217;t say that I was surprised by the results. I was intrigued by all of the different angles in which the study was examined from in terms of social media being a factor in young adult&#8217;s health behaviors, food playing a role, and television commercials as well. I look forward to reading about what future studies show.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of Apple&#8217;s newest products, the Apple Watch, made its debut in the Spring of 2015. It is an incredible device, and it&#8217;s popularity has exploded because people love the thought of technology right at their fingertips.The watch &#8220;quickly became the best-selling wearable device with the shipment of 4.2 million smartwatches in the second quarter of 2015&#8221; (&#8220;Apple Watch,&#8221; 2015). Apple watch allows you to view text messages and e-mails right on your wrist, while allowing you to keep your iPhone in your pocket (&#8220;Apple Watch,&#8221; 2015). People like this because it comes off as more professional. For example, if an attendee is in the middle of a meeting, it typically isn&#8217;t appropriate for him or her to pull out a phone. However, if the attendee is just looking at their watch, chances are no one can tell the difference. Additionally, users can hold phone conversations and speak right into the watch to reply to messages. This is helpful because people like to be able to manage their time as efficiently as possible. Since the apple watch gives people such easy access to technology, it&#8217;s popularity is going to continue to reflect that.</p>
<p>Through the Fitness app on the watch, people can track their physical activity and send data back to their phone to keep for future records (&#8220;Apple Watch,&#8221; 2015).This feature of the watch is just another of many reasons that people are so drawn to this technology. People no longer have to carry additional equipment with them, aside from their phone and watch, to track their physical activity throughout their day. This is also a huge convenience piece, and people are majorly in favor of it. Interestingly enough even with this convenience factor in mind that draw people to purchase the watch, there have been some negative reviews. &#8220;Many reviewers described the watch as functional and convenient, while also noting failure to offer as much potential functionality as preceding smartphones&#8221; (&#8220;Apple Watch,&#8221; 2015). However, even with mixed reviews, people are still going to be interested in purchasing the watch to explore it for themselves, and still consider it a convenient tool that they can have easy access to.</p>
<p>The Apple Watch comes in different collections, sizes, and colors, providing buyers with lots of choice (&#8220;Apple Watch,&#8221; 2015). Today&#8217;s generation goes crazy at the thought of a thinner, sleeker, piece of technology because of it&#8217;s convenience factor. Apple Watch, along with many other new technologies have proven that people are willing to pay a hefty price just so that they can have the latest and greatest. People want to be able to access technology while putting forth the least amount of effort possible.</p>
<p>In conclusion, Apple Watch is a great example of a new technology that has attracted the attention of millions simply because of its look, its usefulness, and its incredibly small size. Apple watch does it all, and it is going to continue to be a huge success as more versions come out in the future.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In today’s society, I think that it is safe to say that we can’t live without the Internet. Through using the Internet, we have access right at our fingertips to news, social media, and numerous search engines such as Google and Yahoo. Since we can so easily access the Internet, sources like the newspaper are becoming less important. Anything we come across in the newspaper, chances are we will be able to find on the Internet faster.</p>
<p>An incredible social media tool that the Internet provides us access to is Facebook. It has been in existence for just over ten years now, and is the most popular social media website, attracting more than 1.49 billion users (Reddy, 2015). Facebook also allows us to view news, more specifically though, news that typically targets human interest. The Internet is “increasingly impacting all spheres of life across the world” (Reddy, 2015). It is coming to a point where people are becoming dependent on Facebook, and some people want to get connected to the Internet solely so that they can become active on Facebook. Before the Internet, not only did we not have access to Facebook, but we also relied heavily on resources such as newspapers, magazines, and radio to find out information. Google and Facebook are continually becoming more popularized in today’s society since they contain such a significant amount of information and serve as such a beneficial tool in our daily lives. It is said that “Facebook and Google will continue to dominate the online space” (Reddy, 2015). Both tools wouldn’t have been made possible without the Internet. The Internet now allows us to search for potential jobs, conduct research, connect with people nationwide, and so much more. It is because of reasons like these that Facebook and Google will continue to dominate our online world and keep us coming back. Having access to so many incredible tools myself in today’s society, it is hard to imagine what life would be like without the Internet. In conclusion, the ways in which we benefit from Internet access in today’s society are endless. This generation has brought us more technological resources than ever before.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left">     Mike Hanski&#8217;s article titled &#8220;Want to be a Better Writer? Read More.&#8221; discusses the importance of how reading can benefit numerous aspects of the self. Some of his major points included that reading influences your writing, influences your study, and most importantly in my opinion, increases your vocabulary. Having a well-built vocabulary is not only beneficial for your writing and for school, but for everyday life. After college when it comes time to apply and interview for jobs it is valuable to have an understanding of complex concepts and be able to converse intelligently as you get older. Hanski states that &#8220;reading widens a vocabulary, broadens a kid&#8217;s mind, and helps him understand the world better&#8221; (p.2). These are tools that are beneficial for a lifetime.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">     When I am reading and come across a word that seems unfamiliar, taking a few minutes to research the definition always makes a huge difference in my understanding of the reading. Additionally, I am learning new terms that I hopefully will be able to apply and make new ideas out of in future writings. As I build my vocabulary, I find that the quality of my writing increases, in addition to my overall performance in school. This is not only a huge confidence booster, but it encourages me to read more. I find that I feel most motivated to read when it is on a topic that I am interested in. I enjoy reading for pleasure beyond the reading that is assigned in class because it helps me to find where my interests are. Reading newspapers and non-fiction stories allow you to learn about the world which is so important to be knowledgable about. Today, with access to such a vast amount of portable technology such as Kindles, iPads, and iPhones, access to reading material has become easier than ever. In conclusion, if I didn&#8217;t read as much as I do, I would find myself struggling when it comes time to write papers and have to apply my knowledge into real world activities.</p>
