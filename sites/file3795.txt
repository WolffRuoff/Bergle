								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Right now I am sitting at gate B10 at the Philadelphia International airport, anxiously awaiting the plane that will take me back to Chicago for the first since the beginning of January. Finals are over. And I am officially a Junior in college. I can&#8217;t believe it.</p>
<p>The last couple weeks of school are always an interesting mix of work, stress, fun, friends and good-byes. Although good-byes are always hard, I got to say farewell to the school with style! I went to the Muhlenberg Theatre Association formal at Brewworks the Friday before finals. It was a fabulous way to blow off steam before we all had to hit the books for finals.</p>

<p>MTA formal was a blast (albeit a little sweaty), and when I returned to campus I got to celebrate one of my favorite events on campus&#8230;.Midnight Breakfast!</p>
<p>From 11-2am, the Friday before finals in the Spring semester, the administrative staff prepare and serve breakfast to hundreds of hungry students. Pancakes have never tasted so good.</p>
<p>When I then woke up on Saturday, I hit the books and started working on several term papers and began studying for exams and preparing for scene presentations&#8230;.Phew.</p>
<p>On Sunday I had the opportunity to spend some quality time with the Muhlenberg Tour Guide community. The exec board planned and organized a tie-dye and ice cream get together. I was very adamant about the tie-dyeing part&#8230;who doesn&#8217;t like tie-dyeing? No one. That&#8217;s who.</p>

<p>Since I am going abroad next Fall, I will be relieved of my tour guide/tour guide execÂ  duties. We had a lot of good times this semester, and I will miss it a lot!</p>
<div id="attachment_1052" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/05/1-2.jpeg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1052" class="size-medium wp-image-1052" src="http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/05/1-2-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/05/1-2-300x225.jpg 300w, http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/05/1-2.jpeg 320w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-1052" class="wp-caption-text">Me and the rest of tour guide exec board (Minus Avi and Josh)</p></div>
<p>After that, I was done with study breaks for about five days. I spent what felt like hundreds of hours in Seegers Union, and drank what felt like gallons of coffee, but despite the work and the stress, I got the opportunity to spend some quality time with my friends.</p>
<p>The papers were written. The scene presentations were performed. And the exams were completed. And now I am here. With about ten minutes before I board the plane &#8211; the only thing between me and home.</p>
<p>I am going to miss the Seniors terribly. These were the people that I looked up to the minute I stepped on this campus, and now they are moving on to the real world. I know we will keep in touch. Among the hardest people to say good bye to was Ari, my MTA big:</p>

<p>It was also hard saying good bye to some of my friends that I knew I wouldn&#8217;t see for the next eight months as I journey to London for the Fall. It is sad, but I cannot wait to begin this exciting chapter of my life.</p>
<p>This is my last blog for the year. It has been a pleasure writing for it. I hope everyone has a fantastic Summer!</p>
<p>Peace out!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am writing from the lovely Seegers Union couches right next to Java Joe&#8217;s. This is my home. For this entire semester this has been my home base. During the week this is where I do most of my studying, socializing, eating, and sleeping (just kidding!). These weeks are the craziest of the year. Only a couple of weeks left of classes which means major studying for exams, putting together presentations, and meeting with partners. Slowly but surely everything is coming together. I hope that my Herculean strength will continue to power me through to success. Last week I had Thanksgiving break as a brief break from Muhlenland. I flew out of the lovely and quaint Lehigh Valley International Airport, which is only twenty minutes away from campus, and flew into O&#8217;Hare despite some weather worries.</p>
<p>Thanksgiving was the first time I have been home all semester. I love it at Muhlenberg, but there is seriously no place like home. It was so nice to see my family, friends, and of course my beloved dog, Beatrice. The Thanksgiving meal was delicious, of course, but I am personally very fond of Black Friday shopping. Even Beatrice joined in the fun!!!</p>
<div id="attachment_779" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/11/DSCN03381.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-779" class="size-medium wp-image-779" src="http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/11/DSCN03381-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/11/DSCN03381-300x225.jpg 300w, http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/11/DSCN03381-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-779" class="wp-caption-text">Beatrice models her new boots!</p></div>
<p>But of course, I was back on the plane to Allentown in no time at all, headed back to Muhlenland. I am back on my beloved couches. The fire is burning in Seegers, giving off a lovely seasonal ambiance. The beautiful winter wreaths are beginning to be put up all over campus. The Christmas music is soothing coming from the Java Joe&#8217;s stereo and makes everyone&#8217;s mood a little brighter, so even though we are all working really hard, there is a lightness and a joy that is undeniable.</p>
<p>Today I took a brief few minutes of my day to take in the Linda Stein exhibit in the Martin Art Gallery. The Martin Art Gallery exhibits diverse provocative art shows in its intimate space in order to expose students, faculty, and staff to professionals in the art world free of charge. Linda Stein&#8217;s exhibit is titled &#8220;The Fluidity of Gender: Sculpture by Linda Stein&#8221;. The sculptures are wearable body suits made out of leather and other materials. The garments are incredibly striking and intricate, and each one makes a different statement about the role of women in society.</p>
<div id="attachment_780" style="width: 231px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/11/linda_stein.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-780" class="size-medium wp-image-780" src="http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/11/linda_stein-221x300.jpg" alt="" width="221" height="300" srcset="http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/11/linda_stein-221x300.jpg 221w, http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/11/linda_stein.jpg 241w" sizes="(max-width: 221px) 100vw, 221px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-780" class="wp-caption-text">One of Linda Stein&#39;s incredible pieces!</p></div>
<p>I feel so lucky to be exposed to the arts on and off campus through Muhlenberg. I am so lucky to go to a school where I have the arts at my fingertips. When I am home, I love going to museums in Chicago, so I am very grateful to have a mini Art Institute across the street from where I live!</p>
<p>That&#8217;s all for now! I&#8217;m going avoid the rain and continue do work from the comfort of my couches.</p>
