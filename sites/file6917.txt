<p>This week in class, we focused on Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). In 2013 the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) released it&#8217;s 5th edition (DSM-5).  In the DSM-5 they labeled ASD as the umbrella term that is used to diagnose a series of developmental disorders. A developmental disorder is a disorder that manifests challenges in nonverbal communication, speech, and social interaction In addition to relabeling ASD they revised which disorders fall under the spectrum. However, many psychologists argue if the classifications in the DSM-5 were correct. Especially when it involves Asperger&#8217;s Syndrome.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What is Asperger&#8217;s Syndrome?</span></p>
<p>Asperger&#8217;s Syndrome, also synonymous with High-Functioning Autism, is a developmental disorder that is primarily characterized by difficulty in social interactions; this includes challenges with understanding emotions, the &#8220;give and take&#8221; of conversation, and nonverbal communication (i.e. speaking from a distance, tone,  and volume). The challenges with social interactions are right in line with Autism. However, according to the previous DSM system, with Asperger&#8217;s there is no significant language or cognitive delay when it comes to Asperger&#8217;s. In fact people with Asperger&#8217;s tend to have remarkable focus, pay great attention to detail, and may excel in fields such as engineering, accounting, and mathematics to name a few.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The debate</span></p>
<p>When the DSM-5 was released in 2013 many psychologists were shocked to learn that Asperger&#8217;s Syndrome was being characterized under ASD. Primarily that Asperger&#8217;s misses a crucial criteria of there not being a significant delay in speech. Plus, Asperger&#8217;s is noticed a lot later compared to Autism because it&#8217;s challenges in social situations not speech. Many psychologists argue that Asperger&#8217;s should still have it&#8217;s on classification in the DSM-5 because it is not a social anxiety disorder, but it also doesn&#8217;t quite meet the qualifications to be Autism.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">So what is it?</span></p>
<p>Is it a disability, is it a disorder, or is it just a difference?</p>
<p>A 2002 article by Simon Baron-Cohen attempted to answer this question. According to Baron-Cohen The it depends on which model you want to use to look at it. Psychologists can approach Asperger&#8217;s from the systemizing-empathizing model. In this it looks at the systemize and empathy aspects of Asperger&#8217;s and how that translates to our society. If you look at it from the systemizing portion (where a person&#8217;s strength is understanding &#8216;things&#8217;); Asperger&#8217;s leans more toward that of a disability because our society strives on the idea that people are to be social. People with Asperger&#8217;s tend to shy away from social interactions due to not being able to understanding certain cues. However, if we look at it from the empathy angle (&#8216;understanding people&#8217;), we can understand that people with Asperger&#8217;s have trouble understanding reading people; which can be difficult for anyone, but it is no need for alarm. Mainly because the only reason people with Asperger&#8217;s are seem as &#8216;abnormal&#8221; is because of they have a deficit in the empathizing dimension. Even so people with Asperger&#8217;s can still function and flourish in society. All it takes is being put into the right environment.</p>
<p>Sadly, for treatment and insurance purposes you would need to classify it as a disability or disorder.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Why is it important?</span></p>
<p>This debate is important because it shows us what improvements can be made to ending the stigma surrounding not only Asperger&#8217;s but ASD. We focus so heavily on this need to classify people into categories of &#8216;normal&#8217; and &#8216;abnormal&#8217;, all while forgetting that these are people we&#8217;re referring to. It is ironic that this field is one of the main causes in the growth of stigma, because to provide treatment we need to provide the answer. Yes, it could also technically be the fault of insurance companies needing a diagnosis in order to treat, but that doesn&#8217;t mean it is right. From here we need to look at ways at classifying without creating more harm to people.</p>
<p>Personally, this topic is close to my heart as someone close to me has Asperger&#8217;s. Yes they exhibit most of the signs: misunderstanding social cues, trouble with nonverbal communication (especially distance), but they excel in mathematics and computer engineering. Had it not been made known that this person has Asperger&#8217;s you would never have known because he functions just like you and me, holds conversations (sometimes too many), and goes about his own business. At most you maybe would have thought he was a little awkward in social situations. As this is something I encounter frequently I understand how easy it is to take the challenges at face value and place it on the disorder. By doing so we minimize the person.;which just adds to the stereotype and stigma.</p>
<p>In conclusion the take away from this is that as a society we need to remember that <strong>people are not defined by their disorders.</strong></p>
