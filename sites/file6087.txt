					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;During my sophomore year I was living in East in C Hall with Danielle Yavorski &#039;10 and Jen Gable &#039;10 who lived down the hallway in D Hall. We were brainstorming ways to raise money for our Relay For Life team and after looking through a fundraising packet, decided that using a purple toilet to replace the chairs of professors would be equally hysterical and attention grabbing. We found one on Craig&#039;s List and after driving to pick it up on a Saturday night, brought it to the bathroom for disinfecting with the help of Jason Steinberg &#039;11. The RA on duty walked into the bathroom while we were there and after getting over her initial shock that it wasn&#039;t a serious situation, she threw up her hands, said &quot;I don&#039;t even want to know&quot;, and walked out. The fundraiser ended up being highly successful and purple toilets were the talk of campus for quite a few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;My dad, who was a member of the class of &#039;14, was showing me around campus when I was in high school, and I noted the inscription Perk&#039;s Hall over the front archway.  I asked him if  Perks was the donor of the building.   He laughed and said that it was originally called Berk&#039;s Hall because it was the gift of the Lutheran Congregations of Berks county.  When and how the bottom loop of the B had broken off and when they started calling it East Hall remains a mystery.  Walter Berger, who along with his alumnae wife Margaret, donated the Learning Center in the Eddinger building told about his jumping out of a window during  a fire in East Hall probably in the teens during WW I.   Was it due to fire damage?
The scars of the bottom half of the loop of the B can still be seen if one looks carefully.  Is the bottom half of the B going to be restored, or kept the way it is .  These  are the things of which legends are made.  Perhaps someone can tell us how this occurred.&lt;/p&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Although neither one of us lived in East, many of our friends did, including the Campus Delegate who hosted me as a prospective student and introduced me to Greg.  I remember sitting around eating takeout and watching movies during the snowstorm of 2003 (probably the last time classes were cancelled for snow!) and looking out her window at the snow-blanketed quad.  The building is such a beautiful staple of campus and a special place for us.  I&#039;m thrilled that it will be renovated instead of replaced, so that we can visit and share our story with generations to come!&lt;/p&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I lived in East my sophomore and junior years at Muhlenberg and loved it!  Each room had its own fireplace, and while they weren&#039;t functional at the time I lived there, it added charm to the room.  Several friends lived in A where I was and others were nearby in B...I can still remember hearing folks down the hall laughing and having fun!  Definitely time for a renovation, but so glad that the charm and character of East are being retained.  I loved living there and hope other students will have the same great experience!!&lt;/p&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I lived in the first floor triple with the bay window in F hall. We always had late night visitors and residents who locked themselves out knocking on our windows to get let into the building. We also had a prime view of the quad and did a lot of people watching!&lt;/p&gt;
