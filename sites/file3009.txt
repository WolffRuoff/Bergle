Student research-presenters are here from across the region, from DeSales, Lafayette, Lehigh, Moravian, Cedar Crest, Kutztown, and Millersville. The conference originated in the suggestions of a handful of Muhlenberg Media &amp; Communication majors who, returning from a conference with faculty over a dozen years ago, wondered if they could establish a social-justice themed conference here in the Lehigh Valley. The current SRSJ co-directors are Kate Ranieri and Amy Corbin, both Media &amp; Communication faculty. Lora Taub-Pervizpour and Susan Kahlenberg are among the other department faculty who have directed the conference in years past.</p>
