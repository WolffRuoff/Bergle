					<description><![CDATA[Interesting article, Group 3.  Variety is of course a great source for the motion picture industry, but what you&#039;re missing from this blog post is a little more analysis of what this means for the industry itself.  So, for example, editors are professionals like directors, actors, and cinematographers, who have formed their own institutional identity in Hollywood - Like these other groups, they too are unionized and have key creative and economic leverage.  Or, you could talk about the role that media events like the Academy Awards play in the industry- as an important facilitator for ticket sales (according to Turow&#039;s power roles framework).  For example, the decision to include 10 instead of 5 films for best picture last year was a market-driven one meant to spark consumer interest in more Hollywood films.  So, the more you can help the blog reader figure out what the importance of your trade magazine story is, the better your blog post will be.  Just let me know if you have questions.  Also, your APA style was slightly off in the beginning, so have a look at that and revise.  Onwards!]]></description>
