<p><a href="http://mediaindustries11.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/04/turner_logo1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1159" src="http://mediaindustries11.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/04/turner_logo1.jpg" alt="" width="132" height="99" /></a>As we have seen again and again, television companies and advertisers alike are increasingly worried that audiences just aren’t watching commercials anymore.  And why should they when the DVR makes it so easy to avoid them?  But the Turner Company, a cable unit owned by the media conglomerate Time Warner, is developing a new strategy to save commercials from falling to their death (ouch!).  The company has undergone a four year effort to create a new kind of advertising strategy that will offer advertisers on the cable networks TBX, TNT, and True something that many others do not: a strong link between the commercial and the TV show that the consumers are viewing. The goal of this effort is to bring consumers back to commercials by making these ads relevant to the specific program and the specific audience.</p>
<p>Turner’s idea is similar to a technique that other networks have come up with, the technique of embedding show content within the commercial breaks.  We saw American Idol trying out this strategy with their “embedded auditions” that ran between commercials.  Networks and advertisers hoped that when viewers saw a flash of that familiar American Idol logo, they would stop fast-forwarding to see the show content, and, with any luck, see some other ads in the process.<span id="more-1155"></span></p>
<p>But the Turner Company’s strategy is a little different: instead of embedding show content into commercial breaks, the company proposes that advertisers work with Turner to create commercials that look or feel like a particular TV program, even though these spots are not actual show content.  The first step in this strategy is to identify particular moments or themes from the TV show that would seem to resonate with audiences or that serve as clear representations of the program.  The Turner Company uses the phrase “tagging” to describe the specific moments or themes that can be integrated into the commercials that will be viewed when the movie or television series is airing. Tuner Company’s thinking behind this tactic is that if the audience watches the television show or series, they must enjoy these themes or moments; therefore if these “tagged” themes are integrated into the commercials when the particular show or series is airing, consumers will be more likely to enjoy and watch the commercials.  So, if this strategy catches on, a company might develop an ad that features an attractive blonde singing in front of a panel of three (probably multi-racial/gender) judges to air during American Idol—it may not be an actual American Idol audition, but it looks like one, so audiences may be more inclined to watch the commercial.</p>
<p>Turner Company has hired several new employees to “tag” specific moments and themes in television series in the hopes of revamping television commercials. An inside source estimates that this new endeavor will cost Turner about a seven-figure sum amount. Linda Yaccarino, Vice President of Turner Entertainment ad sales states, “Such moves are absolutely critical to survival.”  This situation speaks to the enormous power of the client power role, or advertisers.   Turner, a cable distributor, is desperate to make TV attractive for advertisers, as cable networks rely largely on advertisers to make a profit.   As more and more consumers turn to online forms of media, television networks have to compete for advertiser dollars.  We have seen how this has impacted the print industries, which have either faltered or have been forced to go digital as a result of audience erosion and the resulting loss of advertisers.  The Turner Company does not want to suffer the same fate, so it is actively developing new ways to make its TV networks the hot place to advertise.  Plus, this new technique reflects the trend of audience segmentation: advertisers have always chosen to advertise during programs that draw an audience that would be interested in their products, but now there is even more of an opportunity to target an audience through an ad that is tailor-made for a specific audience.</p>
<p>It’s always a little troubling when the line between content creation and advertising gets blurred.  Turner’s mission is to help create commercials that complement television content, but it’s not a stretch to say that this relationship could become reciprocal with television creators creating content that complements commercials.  Or, television creators might be encouraged to dumb down their content so that it will be easier for advertisers to recycle this content in the form of an ad.</p>
<p>But with the incredible commercial zapping capability of DVRs, will the audiences even notice the change in commercials? Yaccarino is hopeful, stating, “A viewer could be ‘zooming through’ with a DVR, but if the advertising looks like the content the viewer tuned in to see in the first place, they may be trained to stop and watch it.” What are we dogs? We will see.</p>

<p>The future of television viewing is here and the battle of cable providers versus networks is on.  Time Warner Cable recently developed an app for the iPad that delivers 17 live TV channels to iPad users via a cable modem.  Another cable distributor, Cablevision, is also developing an app that will deliver live TV to the iPad.  Finally, Dish Network provides a live feed to personal media devices, including the Ipad, through its Sling box service.  Why this shift in cable distribution?  Cable companies are adjusting to the reality that TV is not just watched on television sets anymore: the traditional TV competes with other technologies such as computers and phones. These companies want to distribute TV to all of these technologies rather than watching the television networks sell their rights to competing distributors or directly to the consumers.<span id="more-1070"></span></p>
<p>However, owners of cable networks, including Viacom, Scripps, and Discovery, claim that this type of television distribution requires additional rights to content, and Time Warner Cable, Cablevision and others will have to negotiate for these rights.   Scripps Network went public with its resistance saying it “has not granted iPad streaming rights to any distributor and is actively addressing any misunderstandings on this issue.” The networks’ central argument is that the rights should be sold for an additional premium. They also argue that the content is being delivered through a wireless broadband network and, while ads are shown in the stream, Nielsen isn’t yet able to measure them, which in turn means the networks can’t make money through advertising. Furthermore, networks have appealed to the authority power role, arguing that if the iPad is just another TV, then it should abide by the FCC laws, which would require them to carry broadcast channels required by the regulators.</p>
<p>This is an example of how a new technology can create tension between producer and distributor.   The distributor, the cable companies, doesn’t want to be left behind, so it has little choice but to change its business practices to include newly emerging technologies like the iPad.  However, the networks want to make sure that they get maximum money for their content, so they can hardly allow cable companies to stream TV shows to the iPad without forcing the companies to pay for this right.  The cable distributors are wise to be adaptive to technological changes and to take advantage of their access to TV viewers, one of their most valuable resources. But, just as we saw with Hulu, the networks control television content and, thus, have some power over distributors.</p>
<p>It is a very interesting time for the television industry since the traditional way of watching television programs is changing. Viewers have more options than ever, including Hulu and YouTube, as well as using other technologies like the iPad.   As the consumption of television through alternative screens become more popular, we are also likely to see more structural regulation from the FCC as TV producers and distributors make changes to adjust to the changing face of television.  The authority power role is very important in determining how media can be made and presented, and crucially, how the money gets distributed. As the new technology develops, the regulations will soon to follow. It is interesting and exciting that we get to see what happens next!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jack, M., &amp; Hudson, J. (2011, Jan. 31). LX New York is Alive at Five. <em>Broadcasting &amp; Cable, (141,5).</em> Retrieved from <a href="http://0-web.ebscohost.com.library.muhlenberg.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?hid=8&amp;sid=f5b72ee7-0ab7-4b24-879e-1f00d0d749ae%40sessionmgr11&amp;vid=4" target="_blank">http://0-web.ebscohost.com.library.muhlenberg.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?hid=8&amp;sid=f5b72ee7-0ab7-4b24-879e-1f00d0d749ae%40sessionmgr11&amp;vid=4</a></p>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://assets.nydailynews.com/img/2010/04/06/alg_lx_new_york2.jpg" alt="" width="257" height="176" /></p>
<p>Hoping to interest a new target audience, WMBC New York executives created the 60-minute news program <em>LX New York</em>, which airs daily at 5:00 pm. At first, ratings were less than impressive. As a result, the creators decided to implement some key changes to the show&#8217;s format. These changes were linked to another decision: WMBC executives decided to specifically target suburban women.  To increase show ratings and appeal to these viewers, <em>LX New York</em> started utilizing the city more.  For example, the show began airing cooking segments filmed on the city streets and in local restaurants instead of in the studio. The new and improved <em>LX New York</em> also features celebrity interviews, cooking segments,news snippets, and a topic of the day.</p>
<p><span id="more-823"></span>Additionally, executives brought on a new host, former news anchor Jane Hanson.  By serving as a familiar face, Hanson comes with her own fans, thus, brings more viewers to<em> LX New York</em>.  Producers also created a social media campaign, which included an online, live viewer chat about the show. Specifically, the online resources and viewer chats act as a linking pin for <em>LX New York</em>, an example of a symbiotic relationship between television and internet. Most importantly,the live chats provide a sense of community for fans, forming personal ties and relationship to the show while also providing feedback to producers.  That way, both audiences and producers benefit and gain a sense of power.<br />
<!--more--><br />
However, WMCS and viewers are not the only parties benefitting from the revamped <em>LX New York</em>.  A unique way the show presents its advertisers is through integration into segments, which would not be done in a newscast. For instance, the grocery store chain, Fairway, has sponsored cooking bits. This unique kind of advertising is enticing for advertisers since the product is actually integrated into the program, as opposed to using commercials, which can be bypassed.  This is especially relevant in the age of changing television exhibition, with technologies such as Tivo allowing viewers to simply fast-forward through commercials.</p>
<p>Competitors are thrilled with WMBC’s New York’s change because the new program does not target a news audience anymore, even though it is running during a timeslot traditionally reserved for news programs.  Of course, if the show does too well, it could spawn imitators, which could lead to the replacement of serious news with soft entertainment—a potentially dangerous transition for a democratic society that relies on an informed citizenry.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Morabito, Andrea. (2011, Feb. 7). <em>Broadcasting &amp; Cable. </em>Retrieved from <a href="http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/463581-Super_Bowl_XLV_is_Most_Watched_TV_Program_Ever.php" target="_blank">http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/463581-Super_Bowl_XLV_is_Most_Watched_TV_Program_Ever.php</a>.</p>
<p>Super Bowl XLV last Sunday February 6, was the most watched television show in U.S. history. The game averaged 111 million total views. This beat last year’s Super Bowl’s record of 106.5 million spectators. The Super Bowl always rakes in extreme high numbers of viewers and for the past four years has set a viewership records.</p>
<p>            After the Super Bowl, an episode of <em>Glee</em> aired from 10:30 to 11:45 p.m. 26.8 million people watched increasing its total viewers 17% from its weekly average.<em> Glee’s</em> numbers were bigger than the episode of <em>The Office</em> that followed 2009’s Super Bowl. However, last year’s post Super Bowl’s episode of <em>Undercover Boss</em> drew bigger numbers than both <em>Glee </em>and The <em>Office.<span id="more-769"></span></em></p>
<p>            We suspect that the broad audience of a reality television show would lure in more viewers than a musically based high school sitcom. This makes us think about the idea of public interest and why Fox chose such a special interest show that does not seem to fit the same audience as the Super Bowl. An event like the Super Bowl can unite all different ages and demographics showing the positive possibilities for television. When Fox chooses to show a program like <em>Glee</em>, we feel the network has other motives in mind besides the public interest. Were they trying to attract a broader audience to increase network’s long term viewership? Was Fox trying to piggy back off of the popularity of the Super Bowl to increase <em>Glee’s</em> fan base? While <em>Glee</em> has proved its success, we feel that a show like <em>Undercover Boss</em> which has a wider appeal may have been a better fit for the Super Bowl’s audience’s actual desires and interests. This brings us back to the power relationship between the network heads and the audience. Networks don’t necessarily have to give audiences what may be best but instead they focus on what may be most lucrative, ultimately choosing their rising star, <em>Glee</em>. While traditional all-American football fans may not always mix with musical theater lovers, with Fox has anything to say about it, they will.</p>
