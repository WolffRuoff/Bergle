								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So after a VERY long winter we are finally getting small glimpses of warmer weather! Not quite as warm as the Tuscan hill of Arezzo Italy, but anything above freezing will do. It has been such a busty semester here at Muhlenberg for me (hence my blog absence!!) I&#8217;m taking 6 classes and voice lessons as well as trying to stay as involved in the MTA (Muhlenberg Theater Association) and Delta Zeta activities. Although 6 classes is a lot to handle I really enjoy every single one, however different they may be. I&#8217;m taking: Genes, Genomes and Society, The Jewish Drama, Shakespeare Reproduced, Stagecraft: Scenic Design, The Art of Creative Writing and African Dance and Cultures. I really feel that I am covering a lot of academic bases this semester. Last semester in Italy, my program was heavily focused on physical theater and it was such a wonderful and eye opening experience, but it has been cool to come back to Muhlenberg and get back to the books. I&#8217;m getting small tastes of science, english, theater, dance and a bit of history in my Jewish Drama class-which is a special topics class that combines both the history of the theater and Jews strong involvement in theater.</p>
<p>As far as my MTA and DZ involvement goes, I have been to every theater production thus far on campus this semester, including the amazing mainstage productions Â &#8220;The Learned Ladies&#8221; and &#8220;New Visions Play Series&#8221; as well as the many Studio Productions. Also this semester has been full of fun Delta Zeta actives such as our sisterhood events where we get to hang out with the entire DZ sisterhood and catch up as well as our formal last weekend and this weekend one of our philanthropy events where we are teaming with the fraternity ATO to support the Valley Youth House and their street outreach programÂ by raising money through a Casino Night that every student on campus is invited too!</p>
<p>So, as you can see, I have been quite the busy bee this semester :), but I look forward to more blog posts as the weather gets warmer and spring finally comes to us after this long and cold winter!</p>

<p>Well now we are at the Midway Point! It&#8217;s been 7 weeks that I have lived in Arezzo, Italy and it truly feels like home. This week was our fall break, and I had plans to go to the Netherlands to visit some &#8216;Berg friends, but, as things go, the plans had to change. Although at first I was extremely disappointed, I then realized that staying a week in Arezzo and catching up on some much needed rest (and lots of laundry) was actually a blessing in disguise! I have gotten to explore so much more of the town than I would have if I had gone to the Netherlands. I have discovered new places to eat, new places to sit and read (or people watch) and new places with fully working internet(!!) &#8211; the most exciting of them all, am I right?!</p>
<p>Being here in Arezzo for the past 7 weeks has been like a crazy dream. On our first day here, the director of our program told us that the Accademia (our school), should be like an &#8220;artists utopia&#8221;. Of course a utopia of any kind is a bit hard to create, but after living here and being in classes with people that I have known for a few years and people I just met, I feel that the utopia has formed! It is such a magical feeling to walk into a movement class and be told that today we will be doing only contact improv for 2 hours and even with not knowing everyone in the room super well, we are able to lift one another and lean on one another! Or to go to a voice class outside in a nearby park and scream out lines of texts from <em>The Tempest</em> and not worry about any of your classmates judging you and actually completely forgetting about the outside world. It really has become a beautiful utopia that I can all (a temporary) home.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s all for now! I promise, now that I know where I can find solid WiFi for longer than 5 min, I will have more fun pictures and moments to share!!</p>
<p>Happy weekend everyone! And go see Mystery of Edwin Drood at Muhlenberg this weekend; I hear its awesome <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="ðŸ˜‰" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
