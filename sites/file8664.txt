								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I first googled the IPad, Wiki didn’t even come up as the first website, apple and news articles about the IPad came up. After scrolling down a little and I clicked on the Wiki article I figured that the information about the IPad would be true because who would write false information. But at the same time I was surprised at how much information Wiki has about the IPad.</p>
<p>In high school and even middle school everyone was always told that Wiki was never a reliable source. At first I hated that because Wiki had all this information in one place and back before computers, people use to use Encyclopedias for everything that they needed to look up. It makes you wonder why the online one couldn’t be as reliable, but then who would have wanted to sit down and type up the entire encyclopedia. The information on the IPad though seems pretty much correct. At first when I read the first paragraph about when the IPad first came out, I thought it was wrong. It says April 3, 2010 which doesn’t seem that long ago at all. Even though it was five years ago I feel like I’ve been using tablets my whole life.</p>
<p>My high school required that I have an IPad, everything was on it from our text book, homework, notes, assignments and schedules. It was all done online so for someone who used an IPad all the time it is hard to think that at one point in time that I wasn’t relying on one everyday.</p>
<p>But Steve Jobs had an idea and he stuck with it. According to Wiki, he said in 1983 “strategy is really simple. What we want to do is we want to put an incredibly great computer in a book that you can carry around with you and learn how to use in 20 minutes &#8230; and we really want to do it with a radio link in it so you don’t have to hook up to anything and you’re in communication with all of these larger databases and other computers.” (Steve Jobs, second paragraph) This was before the IPad even came out and became a thing, but one interesting thing that I learned was on the side of Wiki there’s a picture and it says “Apple’s first tablet from 1993” I was too young to remember this coming out but it looks really interesting and cool. It came with a pen and it was more of a smaller tablet that fit in your hand. Apple made other devices like it but decided not to sell it because they didn’t want to hurt message pad sales.</p>
<p>It was really interesting to go on Wiki though and read through an article like this, considering I never use Wiki. It is nice to have a place that all the information about one thing is in one place. But Wiki no longer really comes up as a first website like it use to. The internet has just noticed that I’ve never gone to it or it puts the more popular websites up first. Hopefully one-day Wiki will turn in to a reliable source or there will be another website that will replace Wiki and be so much better.</p>
