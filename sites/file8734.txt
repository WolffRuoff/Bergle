								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As online social networking sites are expanding their popularity, a phenomenon termed “Facebook envy” seems to be on the rise (Appel, 2015). The frustration of logging on to Facebook and being flooded with endless pictures, status updates and friends’ notifications showing what seems to be their perfect lives is one way to describe Facebook envy. This problem has been faced by all Facebook users since 2006 yet still, there is very few research investigating how envy can lead to many other very real physiological effects. Envy and jealousy go hand and hand with depression, yet little is known about the mechanisms underlying this connection. In the “Journal of Social &amp; Clinical Psychology, Vol. 34” a quasi-experimental study entitled, “Social Comparison, Envy, and Depression on Facebook” discusses how Facebook is a high-risk environment for depressed individuals and investigates the severity to which envy harms Facebooks 1 billion users.</p>
<p>In this study, depressed and non-depressed individuals were asked to describe their current levels of self-esteem and were then assigned and compared to a specific Facebook profile. These profiles were either attractive or unattractive and each participant compared themselves to the owner of the profile they were assigned and they reported their resulting feelings. I am sure each feeling was different than the other, yet feelings of envy were the most popular among all test subjects. The original hypothesis for this experiment was that the depressed individuals were expected to feel inferior and more envious, particularly when paired up with an attractive Facebook profile (Appel, 2015). The experiment was also expected to demonstrate how envy can be correlated with low self-esteem, and depressiveness in social comparison.</p>
<p>Social comparison on Facebook is an ongoing process that appears to be the major cause in online envy. This is all a result of Facebooks impression management which allows its users to select, edit and post pictures that misrepresent the truth behind each user’s life (Appel, 2015). This study does a fantastic job in showing how envy is created and why it is harmful. The results were written down, participants were compared to one another and it turns out that resulting envy was higher after seeing an attractive profile. Also, among depressed participants the jealousy experienced was higher than any other. Both results yielded p-values well below zero which gives us strong evidence to conclude that when depressed individuals meet Facebooks misrepresented profiles, the result is in fact envy.</p>
<p>We know by now that Facebook’s boastful atmosphere makes it a very hostile environment for depressed individuals (Appel, 2015).  The results of this experiment shed a new light on the mechanisms underlying the connection between depression and Facebook envy. With this new information, Facebook and many other social networks alike should realize the dangers their users face on a daily basis. Since online social media are already a part of most people’s lives today, interventions must take place soon in order to silence the dangers surrounding the media.</p>
