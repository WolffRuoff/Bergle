			<p>People who attended yesterday’s football game against Dickinson (there weren’t many) or watched it on TV2 or on streaming video might be surprised to know that it wasn’t the first time the Mules played in such adverse conditions.</p>
<p>In 2002, Muhlenberg ended its regular season at Moravian in a game that came to be known as the “Mud Bowl.” Rain most of the week leading up to the game and freezing rain/ice during the game left the field a mess, and it only got worse. The Mules won the game, 8-0.</p>
<p>We asked two men who were on the sidelines for both games, Mule head coach Mike Donnelly and photographer Bill Johnson, to compare the Mud Bowl and the Snow Bowl.</p>
<p>“Both games were the same in the following respects: The defense didn’t allow a point, <a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/snow.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-386" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/snow.jpg" alt="" width="273" height="400" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/snow.jpg 273w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/snow-204x300.jpg 204w" sizes="(max-width: 273px) 100vw, 273px" /></a>the kick game was mistake free (no small accomplishment in extremely bad weather), and the offense dominated up front for 60 minutes,” said Donnelly. “The player enthusiasm level was the same in both – excited to be playing in the game.”</p>
<p>Donnelly also noted that the 2002 game had more riding on it. The win, combined with a Johns Hopkins win against McDaniel, gave Muhlenberg its first NCAA Tournament berth and the opportunity to host two playoff games.</p>
<p>“The Mud Bowl was fun because you could move around,” said Johnson, who took all the great photos below. “Yesterday the snow got so bad, about 6-8 inches deep, that you couldn’t move around. It was very difficult to get from one spot to another.”</p>
<p>The pictures show one obvious difference between the games. “You could see the field better [in 2002]. There were lots of people in the stands, but you couldn’t see player numbers,” said Donnelly. “Yesterday there was no mud, but you couldn’t see the players on the field, or for that matter the field, from the sideline.”</p>
<p>“In the Mud Bowl you couldn’t read jerseys,” said Johnson, who was faced with the task of identifying the photos after the game. Some players were identified by their silhouettes. “Yesterday at least you knew who you were shooting.”</p>
<p>Although the field got dark with mud in 2002 and white with snow yesterday, in the sky it <a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/mud.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-387" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/mud.jpg" alt="" width="262" height="400" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/mud.jpg 262w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/mud-196x300.jpg 196w" sizes="(max-width: 262px) 100vw, 262px" /></a>was the opposite. “It was more difficult to focus the camera yesterday because of how dark it got,” said Johnson. “And everything was so wet there was a little bit of haze on the lens.”</p>
<p>Postgame presented its challenges both years. “After the game the bus drivers wouldn’t let our team on the buses because of the mud on their uniforms,” recalled Donnelly of the 2002 game. “We didn’t bring a change of clothes, so all the kids that played showered in their uniforms just to remove the mud.</p>
<p>“Yesterday we couldn’t shower after the game because of a water problem in the building caused by the snow and power loss to campus.”</p>
<p>Part of the legend that is the Mud Bowl went unnoticed to fans who left right after the game. The buses got stuck in the mud, so the team had to wait for one bus to take a load of players back to campus, then return for a second load. It took a couple of hours, and by that point Moravian had locked the locker room. So the freezing players stood in the entryway of a bank across the street while Donnelly went to a gas mart to buy snack food for a postgame picnic.</p>
<p>Both men relished being part of the experience, both times.</p>
<p>“From a photographer’s standpoint, the games were a lot of fun,” said Johnson. “Opportunities like that come very infrequently. When you shoot as many games as I do, you don’t get a lot of diversity. In these games you get a lot more different views. Things happen more unexpectedly than in a normal game.”</p>
<p>“The 2002 game was famous and unforgettable,” said Donnelly. “The 2011 blizzard game will be equally famous, although our equipment men will not have to wash the uniforms five times after soaking them in enzymes.</p>
<p>“Both were wild, unforgettable games and awesome to be a part of.”</p>

			<p>The last full weekend of the fall season has two teams competing for Centennial Conference championships and another trying to earn a playoff spot.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-46" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="237" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee.jpg 350w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee-300x203.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" /></a>Men’s Soccer vs. Ursinus (Saturday, 11:00)</strong></p>
<p>The Mules (9-5-1, 5-3) are in a three-way tie for third place in the CC with Franklin &amp; Marshall and Swarthmore. They need a win or a tie to clinch a spot in the CC playoffs for the 11th straight year.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg is undefeated (5-0-1) at home this season and undefeated (25-0-2) against Ursinus since 1985. The Bears (3-11-3, 2-5-1) have already played spoiler once this season, defeating then-No. 9 Swarthmore two weeks ago.</p>

<p><strong>Cross Country at Centennial Conference Championships (Saturday, 11:00)</strong></p>
<p>Dickinson is the host for the first CC championship event of the 2011-12 school year. The Mule women are ranked fifth in the region and will look to improve on their sixth-place finish of a year ago. The men also were sixth in 2010.</p>
<p><strong>Football vs. Dickinson (Saturday, 1:00)</strong></p>
<p>It may be Family Weekend at Muhlenberg, but it will feel like Homecoming for the football team, which has not played at home in four weeks. Turnovers could play a role in the outcome, as the Mules (4-3, 4-2) lead the CC with 22 takeaways and the Red Devils (3-4, 3-3) have a league-high 22 giveaways.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg leads the all-time series 39-25-2. In the last two games at Scotty Wood Stadium, a team came back from at least 16 points down to win.</p>

			<p>As the regular season for fall sports comes to an end, we will be taking a closer look at Muhlenberg’s senior student-athletes.</p>
<p>In the coming days, the MuhlBox will feature some of the highlights from the traditional <a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/seniorbanner.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-369 alignright" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/seniorbanner.jpg" alt="" width="360" height="309" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/seniorbanner.jpg 360w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/seniorbanner-300x257.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/seniorbanner-349x300.jpg 349w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" /></a>senior question and answer profiles that run with the programs for Senior Day. So be sure to check back next week when we will profile the seniors from the field hockey, football, and men’s and women’s soccer teams.</p>
<p>We start with volleyball, which beat Ursinus, 3-1, in its final home match on Wednesday. Seniors Davi Gordon, Brooke McQueen and Jackie Price were honored before the game and then played important roles in the win.</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft" src="http://www.muhlenberg.edu/images/main/athletics/women/volleyball/hs/vb11/gordonhs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" />Davi Gordon</strong></p>
<p><strong>What did it feel like playing at Gordon College seeing your name plastered all over the place? </strong>I never really thought about that, but now that you mention it, I guess it was pretty cool! When I was in third grade, I did convince one of my best friends that Jeff Gordon was my uncle, so maybe people will believe me if I tell them the college was named after my family…</p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans? </strong>I am that senior that is not exactly sure what I want to do come May! I think my parents have already changed the locks and turned my bedroom into a workout area, so I should probably figure it out soon. I’m not sure if I want to start coaching and/or work in an office, so I’m just going to go with the flow! I would love to travel the world and visit more countries. But at this point, my minimal funds will probably only get me to the nearest Wawa.</p>
<p><strong>What kind of person is Jackie Price? </strong>Jackie is not only a great teammate, but she is also an amazing friend and roommate! Both on and off the court, Jackie is super competitive and supportive. She is a natural leader and pushes everyone to work their hardest and do their best. I have the utmost faith and trust in her and know that she will get the job done. With a microphone always in hand, or at least close by, Jackie never ceases to be able to make me laugh with her made-up song lyrics, her impeccable barrel rolling, her love of noodles (xoxo) and her flawless peace sign. YEAHBUDDY!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong><img class="alignleft" src="http://www.muhlenberg.edu/images/main/athletics/women/volleyball/hs/vb11/mcqueenhs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" />Brooke McQueen</strong></p>
<p><strong>Are you a fan of the movie <em>Cars</em>? Is Lightning McQueen a longlost automotive relative?  </strong>I get this question a lot! And to many people’s disappointment, I have never even seen the movie! However, I would say that Lightning McQueen and I are long, lost siblings since we both have lightning fast speed!</p>
<p><strong>You’ve had internships at a physician’s office and St. Luke’s Hospital; what were those experiences like? </strong>…<strong> </strong>I have seen C-sections, open heart surgery, eye surgery and total knee replacements, to name a few! Having these experiences where I got to have a front row seat to watch were once-in-a-lifetime-opportunities. The joy and excitement that I got from having these experiences has helped me decide to go into the health care field after graduating.</p>
<p><strong>What kind of teammate is Davi Gordon? </strong>Dav, Davs, Dovensauce, Davilicious, Davicreature, Creatch … How do I describe this girl in one short paragraph? Being not only my teammate, but also best friend since freshman year, Davi makes up one third of the friendship that us seniors have. We refer to ourselves as “the 3/3rds.” Honestly though, Davi is one of the best teammates you could ever ask for. She is a pillar of unending optimism on and off the court. Davi is always there at just the right moment to remind you to smile, breathe or simply pass the ball. She is also there to mop the floor up when even the tiniest drop of sweat may fall! Davi is always sure to make everyone on the team feel included, and that is a valuable attribute that not all teams have. Davi has been a great teammate and an even better friend for the last four years, and I can’t even believe how fast the time has gone!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft" src="http://www.muhlenberg.edu/images/main/athletics/women/volleyball/hs/vb11/pricehs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" />Jackie Price</strong></p>
<p><strong>What was it like studying abroad in Geneva last spring? </strong>It was definitely one of the highlights of my college career. We attended lectures at the UN, Red Cross and World Health Organization, which taught me so much about public health. Our program took us to Morocco for two weeks, where I lived with another student from my program with a family that spoke no English. We had to communicate via the little French we had learned, but we did create long-lasting relationships with our family there.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans? </strong>I plan to go to physician’s assistants school. I have worked as a medical assistant and am participating in the St. Luke’s shadow program (yes, the same one Brooke did last year since we are basically the same person). I have had great practice thanks to Davi, who seems to have come down with almost every injury and illness there is. From bone bruises to bulging disks, she always keeps me and Brooke, the “PA roomies,” on the edge of our seats trying to figure out what is wrong.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s Brooke McQueen like off the court? </strong>Brooke is a very energetic, outgoing, hard-working and great friend and roommate!! In addition to her positivity on the court, she is always smiling and more than willing to help out one of her friends. I am so glad that I have become so close with her. After living with her for the past three years, she has become one of my best friends. Whether it is in volleyball, academics or our social lives, we are always able to relate to each other and share a laugh. She works extremely hard, and I admire her for how well she is able to multitask and succeed in all that she does.</p>

			<p><em></em><em><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/dornenburghs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-362" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/dornenburghs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Junior Kristen Dornenburg is a three-year starter at goalie for the Muhlenberg field hockey team and one of the progam&#8217;s all-time leaders in saves. But on Saturday, she and her teammates had a more important save in mind &#8211; trying to save her sister&#8217;s vision. Here&#8217;s their story, as told by Kristen:</em></p>
<p>My sister Gail is three years older than I am.  When we were younger, I always wanted to do things the same way she did. Luckily, when I was in second grade and she was in fifth, my eye doctor told me it was time to wear glasses, and because Gail was already wearing them I was so excited to be able to wear them too. </p>
<p>As I got older, my vision worsened more than hers did, and I ended getting contacts before she did, which was also very exciting. It was like I had started my own trend. </p>
<p>As we got older and Gail moved on to high school, her vision was finally catching up with mine. By her late high school years she had completely surpassed me and our eye doctor was starting to worry. In her freshman year of college, we began to find out that her vision would never again be 20/20, even with corrective lenses. At this point she was seeing around 20/40, which to anyone who has glasses or contacts would be the equivalent of having to squint at the board to be able to see clearly. </p>
<p>As Gail&#8217;s vision worsened, my family started taking her to different eye professionals to see if they could diagnose exactly what was going on. For all these doctor’s appointments, Gail was missing classes and important freshman year experiences and decided to transfer from American University, almost three hours away from home, to Moravian College, just an hour away. </p>
<p>Finally a doctor was able to tell her that they were almost 100% sure she had Stargardt Disease. This is a juvenile form of macular degeneration, a retinal degenerative disease that affects central vision, color vision and sensitivity to light.</p>
<p>Gail’s vision has gotten worse since her freshman year of college five years ago, and now with correction she can only see 20/200, meaning she is legally blind. Along with having to put books close to her face and sit inches from the TV screen, she is also no longer allowed to drive. This means getting to work or going to the mall, the grocery store or anywhere is a struggle and she has to be dependent on others.</p>
<p>In the past five years, Gail and my family have learned how to adapt to her disability and have reached out the blind and vision impaired community to find hope and answers for her future. The Foundation for Fighting Blindness works with eye professionals <a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/visionwalklogo.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-364" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/visionwalklogo.jpg" alt="" width="180" height="180" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/visionwalklogo.jpg 180w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/visionwalklogo-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 180px) 100vw, 180px" /></a>around the world to try to find cures and treatment for people with these impairments. They raise money to fund these programs and one of the ways they do it is Vision Walk, a walk just like any other fundraiser, except with the intent of curing blindness. </p>
<p>For the past three years, my family has worked to put together a team to go to Vision Walk, and all three years we have had support from my field hockey team. Last year they weren’t able to go because we had a game the same day as the walk, and their presence was missed. This year we had a blast! Some people got their faces painted, others used the walk as a run for a workout, and we all ate real Philadelphia cheese steaks (which was a first for some).</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/visionwalk2011.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-363" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/visionwalk2011.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="393" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/visionwalk2011.jpg 750w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/visionwalk2011-300x157.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/visionwalk2011-500x262.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></a></p>
<p>Most of all, just knowing that my team cared enough about me and my family to come out and support us was the best part. Knowing that my family has the support of so many wonderful people gives us hope that people will continue to learn about her disease and come to these walks to build awareness.</p>

He became just the 10th player in program history to throw a touchdown pass of at least 80 yards, and he also rushed once for 17 yards.</p>

			<p>Dan Deighan has proven he can beat teams with both his arm and his legs, but during the Muhlenberg football team’s game at Juniata, the Mule quarterback showed he can beat teams with his hands as well.</p>
<p>In the Mules’ 28-3 win over the Eagles yesterday, he caught three passes for 113 yards <a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/deighanjun.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-351" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/deighanjun.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="498" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/deighanjun.jpg 250w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/deighanjun-150x300.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px" /></a>and two touchdowns to become the first player in program history to score multiple touchdowns both passing and receiving in the same season.</p>
<p>“It’s like riding a bike, it comes back to you quick,” said Deighan, who spent some time at receiver during his freshman season. “I’ve been in the position before, so it was nothing strange. And if that’s what it takes to win, that’s all that matters.”</p>
<p>On the first play of Muhlenberg’s third drive, backup quarterback Joe Carlucci hit a wide-open Deighan over the middle. He turned on the jets and outran three pursuers to complete an 80-yard touchdown.</p>
<p>That play, coupled with his 95-yard scoring pass against F&amp;M, made him the first Mule player to throw and catch 80-plus yard touchdowns in the same season.</p>
<p>On Muhlenberg’s first drive of the fourth quarter, Carlucci hit Deighan two more times, including the final score of the day, a 12-yard touchdown along the left sideline.</p>
<p>“Coach schemed up the plays pretty well, and Joe put the throws right on; they were perfect,” Deighan said. “All I had to do was catch them, and I have to admit, I did get a little worried I might drop them.”</p>
<p>The idea was hatched earlier this week when the coaches approached the two quarterbacks with the plan. And when Deighan split out wide for the first time during practice on Tuesday, it raised some eyebrows, especially on the other side of the ball.</p>
<p>And since Deighan’s jersey No. 3 and Carlucci’s No. 8 can look similar from afar, it made some players squint to make sure they were seeing straight.</p>
<p>“It was a little weird at first,” senior linebacker Patrick McDonough said. “You get pretty used to seeing Dan in the backfield. But it was cool to see a little change up, and it obviously worked, the offense played well.”</p>
<p>Deighan’s stellar day made him the first Mule player to have a 100-yard receiving game and 200-yard passing game in the same season.</p>
<p>“Today I was pretty used to it because we practiced it all week, but Tuesday it was a little bit weird seeing him out there,” Carlucci said. “But eventually I got more comfortable with it. And I like throwing to him, I can definitely tell you that.”</p>
<p>But just because he had a big receiving day, don’t think for a second that Deighan is going to start giving his receivers grief if they don’t catch his passes.</p>
<p>Besides learning how to find open spaces in the defenses and evade defenders down the field, he also said he got an even greater appreciation for just how difficult it can be to haul in a pass in traffic.</p>
<p>“I’ve definitely seen the other side of it; it’s not as easy as it looks,” Deighan said. “It felt great to help the team get a win, and I’ve got even more respect for all of our receivers now.”</p>

<p>Muhlenberg plays the first of back-to-back crucial Centennial Conference road games under the lights at Gettysburg. The Mules (8-4-1, 4-2) are in a three-way tie for second place in the CC, one point ahead of the Bullets (6-6-1, 3-2-1).</p>
<p>Gettysburg started out 3-0-1 in the CC but has lost its last two games to Swarthmore and Haverford. The Bullets have played six 1-0 games and a 0-0 tie.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg has won three straight CC games following road losses to Johns Hopkins and Swarthmore. Like the Bullets, the Mules have allowed only four goals in six CC games.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg leads the all-time series 33-18-6, including a 12-4-2 margin in CC competition. The Mules have won four straight meetings, the last three by shutout.</p>

<p><strong>Football at Juniata (Saturday, 1:00)</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg looks to rebound from a disappointing loss at Gettysburg last week against a team it has never lost to. In fact, since Juniata joined the Centennial Conference in 2007, it has not scored an offensive touchdown against the Mules. The Eagles come in with an 18-game losing streak.</p>

			<p>Want to see the best in Division III basketball this winter? Come to a Muhlenberg doubleheader.</p>
<p>The D3hoops.com preseason All-America teams were released this week, and of the nearly 400 schools that sponsor men’s and women’s basketball at the Division III level, Muhlenberg was one of only two (Wheaton of Illinois was the other) to have a representative on both teams. Spencer Liddic of the men’s team was named to the second team, and women’s player Alexandra Chili was a third-team selection.</p>
<p>Here’s a quick look at how the two preseason All-Americans compare:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/chili.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-339" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/chili.jpg" alt="" width="138" height="296" /></a>Alexandra Chili</strong></li>

<li>Wow! record broken last year: Needed only three seasons to break CC career record for three-pointers</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/liddic.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-340" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/liddic.jpg" alt="" width="138" height="296" /></a>Spencer Liddic</strong></li>
<li>Number: 34</li>
<li>Position: Forward</li>
<li>Hometown: Clarks Summit, Pa.</li>
<li>All-Centennial Conference first team: 2010 and 2011</li>
<li>CC Academic Honor Roll: 2010 and 2011</li>
<li>2010 Scotty Wood Tournament: MVP</li>

<li>Not just a scorer fact II: Seventh on all-time blocked shots list</li>
<li>Wow! record broken last year: Broke 40-year-old school record for points in a season</li>
</ul>
<p>The two have a lot in common, from their academic and athletic successes at Muhlenberg to mutual respect for each other.</p>
<p>“Spencer Liddic will have always have a talent that I will never be able to possess; the dunk,” said Chili. “Often, I&#8217;ve asked Big Spence, ‘Will you teach me how to dunk? Teach me, teach me how to dunk,’ and even with his best efforts, the second-team preseason All-American has had little success. I recognize that the fault lies in my own athletic shortcomings and that maybe it&#8217;s time I try to pass something on to Spencer. I think the behind-the-back pass will fit into his repertoire perfectly.</p>
<p>“Boasting a D3hoops.com all-region first team and a unanimous All-Centennial Conference selection for the second year in a row, Spencer&#8217;s junior year sealed his fate as one of the most influential men&#8217;s basketball players of the Muhlenberg program. I know his senior year will only be better. This season, not only will Spencer stun the crowd with his unstoppable double-doubles, beautiful elbow jumpers and sweet post moves, he will continue to be a great senior leader. His hustle on the court never stops and he truly inspires all his teammates, and even the women&#8217;s team, to play better. I&#8217;ve been fortunate to share the spotlight the past few years with the stellar Spencer and I can&#8217;t wait to start our seasons up against Moravian on November 15! I know it will be a great year for all of us.”</p>
<p>&#8220;It has been such an amazing experience getting the opportunity to watch Alex Chili grow and mature over the past few years into the dominant player she is today,&#8221; said Liddic. &#8220;Her most obvious threat is her unbelievable shooting ability. She has had players attempt to faceguard her since freshman year, and nothing seems to stop her. Another one of Alex’s strengths is her ability to find her teammates. Over the past three years, she has impressed the crowd over and over again with her behind-the-back passes and alley-oops to various high-flying dunkers on her team.</p>
<p>&#8220;Players like Alex only come around once in a lifetime and it’s an honor to have the opportunity to watch her play since freshman year. I look forward to once again watching Alex dominate the court and can’t wait to see which Muhlenberg, Centennial and D3 record she will be breaking this year.&#8221;</p>
