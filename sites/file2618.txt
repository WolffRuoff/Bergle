								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lafayette, J.  (2011, February 1). MTV’s ‘Skins’ Continues Ratings Slide Except with Teens.  <em>Broadcasting &amp; Cable</em>. Retrieved from <a href="http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/463300-MTV_s_Skins_Continues_Ratings_Slide_Except_with_Teens.php">http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/463300-MTV_s_Skins_Continues_Ratings_Slide_Except_with_Teens.php</a>.</p>
<p>The new MTV show <em><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=skins+us+trailer&amp;aq=f">Skins</a>,</em> a program that depicts (quite explicitly) “the sex and drug habits of teens,” is already facing pressure from audiences and advertisers, even though the show has only aired three episodes.  Although MTV aims its programming towards the 12-34 year old demographic, <em>Skins</em> has been wildly popular with 12-17 year olds (omg!), which is troubling for many parents.  One major media advocacy organization, The Parents Television Council, labeled <em>Skins</em> the “’&#8217;most dangerous show&#8217; on TV for children.&#8221;  Even Viacom, which owns MTV, has acknowledged these concerns, suggesting the show may, in fact, violate child pornography laws.  This negative attention has also worried advertisers, many of whom have opted to remove their advertisements from MTV during <em>Skins&#8217; </em>time slot.</p>
<p><span id="more-731"></span>The outcry over <em>Skins</em> complicates that old media adage that sex sells.  <em>Skins</em>’ racy content has upset public advocacy groups, which have significant power to shape television programming.  While we often think of government regulation as the key way to address questionable media content, this example suggests that public advocacy organizations can also be effective by encouraging media producers to self-regulate.  As a public advocacy group, the PTC has the ability to draw negative attention to <em>Skins</em>, increasing the likelihood that other parents will think twice before allowing their own kids to watch the program.  Plus, networks know that if they fail to listen to advocacy groups&#8217; concerns, these groups can turn to the government to secure mandated content regulation.   These two resources, publicity and the threat of government-regulation, give advocacy groups like the PTC an edge when dealing with media producers like MTV, and could very well persuade MTV to dial back on <em>Skins</em>&#8216; adult content.</p>
<p>In addition to the PTC, many advertisers have also objected to<em> Skins</em>.  Not wanting to be associated with an increasingly stigmatized show, General Motors, Taco Bell, Schick, Subway, Wrigley, and H&amp;R Block have all removed their ads during <em>Skins</em>’ time slot.  Other sponsors who had secured product placement deals with MTV, including Clearasil, are also considering withdrawing their involvement with <em>Skins. </em>So, advertisers, which fill the power role of client, can also use their resources to motivate television networks to self-regulate their content.   When a client like Subway withdraws its ads from MTV during <em>Skins</em>&#8216; time slot, this is an example of a client exercising its power, or strategically withholding its resources.  As television networks rely on money from advertisers, MTV, again, has an interest in self-regulating its controversial material in order to hold onto advertisers and the money that they control.</p>
<p>Whether you think the uproar over <em>Skins</em> represents a move towards a sensible solution or senseless censorship, one thing’s for sure: the <strong>ombudspeople</strong> at MTV must be very busy.</p>
