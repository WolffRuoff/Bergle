Our goal is to list all scholarly books and articles published during the tenure of a faculty or staff member at the College. Thanks to all faculty and staff who have submitted citations of their publications to us so far. It is from this database that we generate citation lists for the Source Book, etc.<\/p>\n<p>To get to the database, visit the library home page and click on Special Collections, then Muhlenberg College Digital Commons, or go directly to:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.muhlenberg.edu:8080\/librarydspace\/handle\/10718\/7\">http:\/\/www.muhlenberg.edu:8080\/librarydspace\/handle\/10718\/7<\/a><\/p>\n<p>At your convenience, please review your list of publications as it appears in the database. RSVP to this email with additional citations you may have, or suggestions for changes.<\/p>\n<p>In the future, we are looking to add full text to establish a permanent archive of Muhlenberg scholarly output, but only as copyright holders (usually the publishers) allow. This is very much a work in progress.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>A Scholarly Resource Dedicated to Theatre and Dance Research<\/strong><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>For many years, students, faculty, and staff at Muhlenberg have &#8220;made do&#8221; with the Modern Language Association (MLA) or other interdisciplinary resource to research theatre and dance.
