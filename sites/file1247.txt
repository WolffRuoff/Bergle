								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Although now traditional education is the mainstream, do you think this situation will change in the future? With the progress of the technology and science, online education, which is more convenience and selectivity than traditional education, appears and spreads. “The number of student taking at least one online course has now surpassed 7.1 million and represents 33% (21.3million) of all higher education students.” (Allen&amp; Seaman, 2013) As we all know, traditional education is defined as teacher-centered delivery of instruction to classes of students who are the receivers of information. But what’s online education meant, is it effective to take the online education class?</p>
<p>Online education can also call distance education which refers to educational processes in which teachers and students are separated in space and time and communicate with each other mainly asynchronously. And this means convenience and flexible. For example, we don’t need to waste time on the way to class; we don’t have to go out during winter; we can decide the class time more flexible. Also, it’s impossible for us to find all kinds of courses in one place, no matter top university or educational institution. But in online education, courses are variety and concentrated. If online education has so many benefits, why the mainstream is still the traditional education? “Conversely, researchers who critique online education mention the dissociative process that can accompany virtual learning environments, and acknowledge a disconnect in the instructor and student relationship, as well as in the ability to build a learning community.”(Sasha, A&amp; Reese, 2015) Indeed, imparting knowledge is not the only part important in the education. Face-to-face education likes the college, will also help students improve their social ability which is important for their social life in the future. Also many people think the traditional education is more authority and profession than the online education.</p>
<p>Though we can see both the shortcomings and advantages of the online education, from the data we can still know the number of people taking online classes keeps on increasing. “The current educational trend toward the development of 21st century skills has made online learning attractive to both basic and tertiary education.” (Sasha, A&amp; Reese, 2015) But what about the future, can online education replace the traditional education and become the mainstream, or the online education will never catch up with traditional education?</p>
