								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-104" src="http://mediacom.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2009/09/Untitled-11.jpg" alt="Untitled-1" width="127" height="96" /><em>Dr. Ranieri reflects on significance of internships.</em></p>
<p><em></em>Being a dog lover, I’m fond of the slogan that advises people to stay on the porch if you can’t run with the big dogs. The slogan suggests that if you’re not strong enough, you can’t compete. Our summer interns’ essays entitled <em>How did courses you took prepare you for your internship?</em> offered proof that they are strong contenders.<em> </em> For example, Jill Press learned while studying abroad “to become more independent” . . . a quality “that cannot be taught.” Interning at <a href="http://www.wdhafm.com/">WDHA 105.5</a> FM, Rebecca Shaffer found that <em>Media, Theory &amp; Methods</em> helped her “connect the politics to media.” The “coding skills” Nicole DiStefano learned in the same course were valuable to her as an intern at <a href="http://www.cosmopolitan.com/">Cosmopolitan Magazine</a>. <em>Media &amp; Society</em> groomed Christina Cangelosi to use “the same techniques as I did for the celebrity tracking essays” to create numerous photo galleries as an intern at <a href="http://www.b104.com/main.html">B104</a>.</p>
<p>Organizational and time management skills promoted in the classroom have a high value in the workplace. Jana Elfenbein learned in <em>Popular Culture &amp; Communication</em> to use note cards as an organizational tool which, she said, “helped me during my Weekly Edit meetings with the Health Department” of <a href="http://www.ivillage.com">iVillage</a>. Lisa Siciliano wrote that <em>Studio TV Workshop</em> “prepared her “for the demanding amount of work and fast pace” at her <a href="http://www.mtv.com">MTV</a> internship.</p>
<p><em>New Information Technologies</em> helped Kurt Beyer understand how social media is important for “the spread of information and exposure for talent” in his internship at <a href="http://www.icmtalent.com">International Creative Management</a>.  That course also helped digital native and <a href="http://today.msnbc.msn.com/">NBC Today Show</a> intern Meredith Murphy support “producers who were digital residents.”  Sarah Mellick learned in <em>Hypermedia</em> “how to manipulate photographic images” in Photoshop which was immensely valuable while interning at <a href="http://www.lyonsmaguns.com">Lyons Magnus</a>.</p>
<p>Courses like <em>Documentary Research</em> prepared Jillian Bevacqua by helping her “to understand the creation of a TV show.” Kimberly Kaufman wrote “many of the legal guidelines I had for <em>Documentary Research</em> were the same for <a href="http://www.hybridfilms.tv">Hybrid Films</a>.” Meredith Murphy also found that <em>Documentary Research </em>“was as close to what a producer would do for a television show as a student in a classroom setting.”</p>
<p>Reflecting on her internships at <a href="http://www.nbcnewyork.com/">NBC4 New York Sports</a> and <a href="http://www.ny1.com">NY Channel 1 Sports</a>, Alyssa Scaglione wrote that <em>Sports, Culture &amp; Media</em> “helped me not only sharpen my debating and reasoning skills but also let me form and express opinions about events actually taking place in the sports world.”  The <em>Public Relations</em> course came alive for Catherine Schwartz when she saw “publicists being ‘friendly adversaries’&#8221; at <a href="http://www.pmkhbh.com/">PMK/HBM Public Relations</a>, and for Lanna Solinsky who realized interning at <a href="http://www.tractenbergandco.com/">Tractenberg &amp; Co</a>. how “a unique pitch is critical.”</p>
<p>Whether in the classroom, working on course projects or studying abroad, it’s obvious that our interns get it. They transition easily from theories and skills learned in the classroom to successful work in their internships. Clearly, this summer’s interns can run with the big dogs.</p>

<p>Like many students at Muhlenberg, Eirinn Disbrow and Avivah Furman wanted to volunteer to make their world a better place. They quickly realized however, that making a difference was much more difficult than they had thought. Undeterred, they decided to make a documentary about the challenges of volunteerism. The resulting feature, <em>Good Intentions,</em> debuted this past Friday at Muhlenberg&#8217;s Recital Hall.</p>
<p>Supported by a competitive summer research grant from Muhlenberg, Disbrow and Furman joined a group of American students who signed up to volunteer in Costa Rica. They documented their own experiences and those of their colleagues, focusing on the students&#8217; eagerness and occasional naivete. The film, completed with assistance from a number of Media &amp; Comm faculty,  is a compelling account of the challenges that stand between good intentions and successful results.</p>
<p>Disbrow is a Media &amp; Communication major and Creative Writing minor from Wilton, CT. Furman is a Media &amp; Communication and Film Studies major from Hastings-on-Hudson, NY. Both are juniors.</p>
