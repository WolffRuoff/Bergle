<p>Snow. This is a word I have thought I have known for my entire life, after all, I have even witnessed it on family ski trips. But now that I am a resident, I understand snow is not just a word, it&#8217;s an experience. While it&#8217;s simply a change in weather, it captures the excitement of all who it touches and ironically sparks happiness into everyone. (It&#8217;s ironic because snow is freezing, and can&#8217;t spark&#8230; Yeah, bad joke)</p>
<p>The temporary high of snowfall may very well fade rapidly, because I have already noticed walking from building to building is quite unpleasant. However, nothing can take away this California kid&#8217;s first college snow fall.<br />
