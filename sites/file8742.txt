								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is no doubt that social media plays an enormous role in people’s, mainly teens, lives today. The innumerable amount of social media sites that exist allow today’s youth to feel a sense of connectedness and individuality. However, researchers are beginning to look at the shocking fact that although users are compelled in such a way, the complete opposite is occurring. More, now than ever, social media users are possessing less of a sense of individuality that they ever have before (Andsager, 2014). As if that is not scary enough, these users typically do not even realize that they are being influenced to act, look, or be a certain way. The underlying urges to be a clone of society’s ideal man/woman are causing impressionable teens to fall victim to body dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>In the 1980’s anorexia nervosa and other similar eating disorders became recognized health issues for young girls (Andsager, 2014). More than 30 years later, such eating disorders have become massive health problems for society. Not only has the magnitude of the disorders changed but so have their victims; now it is not unusual for males to be battling the same disorders as females (Andsager, 2014). The article states that factors such as sexual orientation and gender roles need to be taken into consideration when searching for the cause of the eating disorder but at the root of it all is the unnatural and unbearable amounts of social pressure that today’s youth are faced with daily, especially on social media sites (Andsager, 2014). Although males are battling eating disorders and body dissatisfaction just as much as females, in terms of such disorders stemming from social media, females are more abundant. This is due to the fact that there is a generally higher percentage of females that use social media sites (Andsager, 2014).</p>
<p>A quote from the article that truly illustrates the level to which society has sunk and may explain why teens, mostly females, have disorders and dissatisfaction is “[It] has not been physically possible for the idealized U.S. female body to become much thinner in the last 20 years…” (Andsager, 2014). Social media reinforces the need to be as thin as possible because of the ease of access to communities of people that share this belief. Before any form of social media existed, eating disorders and body dissatisfaction were not a well-known issue because teens could not as easily seek out positive reinforcement in their quest for thinness. In today’s world when anything a person wants to find out is one quick Google search away, eating disorders and body dissatisfaction is through the roof. The existence of “Thinspiration” boards on Pinterest and @Perfect_Women profiles on Instagram and Twitter are huge perpetrators. All of the different versions of social pressures on those three popular social media sites were found in one simple search and were accompanied by a multitude of others just like it. Therefore, young females need to recognize the adverse effects of social media and keep them in mind when on such sites. By doing so, users would be less manipulated into believing that they need to look like someone else and accept and love who they are.</p>
