								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Students in Dr. Kahlenberg&#8217;s Health Communication course implemented two public information campaigns to raise awareness of social smoking and addictive smoking, as part of the Great American Smokeout.</p>
<p>Students hosted a smoke free event at the Tavern on Liberty so that students would contemplate healthy sociability.  The Tavern offered drink and food specials, and students hosted a raffle with donated prizes from area businesses; raffle tickets could be purchased or attained through donation of smoking paraphernalia. Funds raised will be donated to the local chapter of the American Cancer Society.</p>
<p>Addicted smokers were featured, literally, in the first annual Health Communication College Student Fashion Show, which showcased the physical effects that smoking has on the body and appearance.  Special effects make up was used to age the models as they progressed through life as a smoker.  The campaigns objective was to raise awareness of the short term health effects, and carbon monoxide testing and treatment options available at Muhlenberg College were provided, along with a screening of the feature film, Thank you for Smoking.</p>
<p>The campaigns were conceptualized, designed, and implemented by Health Communication students, guided by social marketing principles, theories, and methodologies examined throughout the semester.</p>
