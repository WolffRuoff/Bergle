					<description><![CDATA[Excellent post and excellent article links here, Group 1.  The recurring issue in your industry comes back again to the critical importance of distribution and the battles that rage continually among major players over the degree to which other parties can engage in distribution of copyrighted content.  It&#039;s widely felt that the record labels lost control of digital distribution when they ceded so much decision-making power to Apple and iTunes (which looked better at the time than Napster, Gnutella, and other online distributors that were allowing users to transfer music files to one another for free).  Now there seems to be a pullback by those same labels over Amazon entering the fray - If they don succeed in blocking Bezos and Amazon, the big winner here may in fact be Apple.  Great links here, and great fodder for the paper as well!]]></description>
