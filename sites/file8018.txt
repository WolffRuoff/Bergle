								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every person has an image of what a gamer looks like, and unfortunately, many opinions are based off of misconceptions. It may be difficult to understand a gamer from a non-gamer’s perspective, and Maeve Duggan of the Pew Research Center proves that many people are misinformed about gaming. In most of the infographics, those who answered “unsure” made up an unsettling portion of the population (around 20%); it made me question the validity of the results. Even those who identify as gamers may have stereotypes about gaming. According to the survey, “men and women are equally likely to assume that most video game players are men regardless of whether they themselves play games” (Duggan, 2015, p. 3). I have though about this stigma as it applies to my own life, because I used to (and sometimes still do) play games a lot. I have had a lot of boys respond “Oh, that’s cool” when I tell them I play games, but I feel like there is a different reaction if a male identifies as a gamer. He is generally perceived as lazy, as if all he does is play games. Yet, when a female plays games, she is seen as more masculine and that is “cool”? Although these are generalizations, I find these things true in my own life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, I can only imagine that a the idea of a female gamer has become more common over the past decade. As it becomes more and more acceptable for a female to act masculine and vice versa, the stigma of gaming is changing. Just eight years ago, the ratio of males to females in terms of gamers was 13:7, when now it is practically equal (Lenhart, 2008, p.1). I think that this stereotype will begin to fade as time goes on. It will become “normal” for a girl to identify as gamer. Eliminating sexist stigmas like this will eventually lead to more equality for all people. The longer people hold on to ideas, the longer it will take us to progress as a society. So, next time a female tells you she plays games, do not think of it as abnormal, consider her like any other gamer.</p>
