								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Think about how many times a day you read. From the moment you wake up, you are reading everything from street signs to text messages, from newspapers to billboards. People constantly complain about having to read, despite the fact that reading is extremely crucial to our existence. If no one was able to read, it would be very hard to function in society. Mike Hanksi informs us just how important reading is in his article <i>Want to Be a Better Writer? Read More.</i> Within his opening he states,“Reading is fashionable. Again. It’s cool. We bet you can all find many statements about how good and useful reading is, how much it can influence a person and his way of thinking… ” (Hanski, 2014).</p>
<p>If someone explained to you exactly how to be a great writer, would you listen? If they laid everything out, would you follow through? Hanski does just this. He depicts the sole way to becoming a successful writer is by reading. By doing this, one will become more educated and discover inspiration. Ideas obtained through reading will only increase your ability when writing. Reading can make your brain function stronger; it exercises your mind and circulates blood flow to the brain. From there it continues with reducing the likelihood of contracting Alzheimer’s disease and even makes a person more sympathetic. The benefits of reading are endless, so why would one not take that chance and run with it. It’s a no brainer to utilize reading as a tool to just make your writing exceptional and to improve your quality of life.  Mike quotes famous author Stephen King,“ If you don’t have the time to read, you don’t have the time (or the tools) to write. Simple as that” (Hanski, 2014). Even a well renowned, published author agrees with Hanski that reading is quite an essential aspect of being a great writer.</p>
