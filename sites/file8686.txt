								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In 2010, co-founders Travis Kalanick and Garrett Camp released an app that would change transportation forever. With technology growing at a rapid rate as well as apps and social media starting to become increasingly important in everyday life, Uber was created as an easier, quicker, and cheaper way to transport. Starting in only big cities such as New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago, Uber proved to be the mode of transportation that each city was lacking. In New York, the iconic yellow taxi ruled the streets but with such a high demand all the time, finding an unoccupied cab was easier said than done. In a matter of seconds Uber lets each user set their location, destination, gives a fare estimate, and labels what time the cab will arrive at your given destination. Uber gives smartphone users the ability to connect with their driver in the easiest and cheapest way possible. The best part about Uber is not having to directly pay the driver for their services. All payments are linked through a credit or debit card account that charges the passenger once their ride is over. The creation of Uber has changed the way people travel from place to place. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With Uber’s massive success in the United States throughout limited cities, the company decided to expand globally. As of 2015, Uber has launched in 60 cities worldwide including countries all over Asia, Africa, and Europe. Traveling through a foreign country can be extremely difficult in terms of navigation but Uber has given people the ability to not have to be able to communicate in an unfamiliar language in order to get from place to place. With the ability to use your current location and set a destination where you would like to go, Uber has eliminated helplessly looking for historics sites, a restaurant, or any other specific location. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Uber is not just available in big cities but has also branched out to rural and suburb areas. In a small town, rarely does anyone ever see a taxi just driving around looking for a customer and not every small town has a taxi service willing to pick someone up and drive that passenger long distances. Uber has given people in less populated areas the ability to get from place to place at the with just a few taps on their smartphones. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The requirements for becoming an Uber driver include being able to pass a background check as well as having a license and car. Once these tasks are passed, you are free to be an Uber driver. This proves to be one of the reasons along with cheaper prices why Uber is currently taking over cities around the world. In a place like London, it takes up to four years to become a taxi driver. Each candidate must drive around the city on a motorcycle learning all the streets from a book that they are given by the taxi service. In New York, each candidate must attend a training course to become a yellow cab driver. Uber does not require any of these steps which makes people more inclined to become an Uber driver rather than a Taxi company. With Uber’s growing presence in places all over the world, taxi drivers have become more and more irritated by Uber drivers taking their business. Just this summer in Paris, violent protests broke out between Uber drivers and Taxi company drivers. The protests definitely indicate a shift from taxi companies to Uber controlling the roads. With Uber working everyday to improve their services, it&#8217;s only a matter of time before they eliminate taxi companies forever and continue changing the way we travel. </span></p>
