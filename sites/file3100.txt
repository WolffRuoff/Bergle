Rodale is a publishing company that publishes some of the bestknown health and wellness magazines and trade books.  I have previously worked for their Bicycling Magazine and have just wrapped up my time with their Organic Gardening magazine.  Both bicycling and gardening were two things that I really did not have a great deal of familiarity with.  After the completion of my internship I truly learned a great deal about each.   More importantly I have gained extensive knowledge of the publishing world.  What I am most proud of is that I have learned how to become a better writer.  I have also learned that I am truly interested in print media and I hope to continue on a path that leads me into the publishing industry.  The people I have come in contact with at Rodale have been nothing but kind, supportive, and helpful.  My daily tasks included writing, research, and interviewing people from all over the country.  There was never a dull moment at OG, and I look forward to another internship in the Spring with Rodale.com!</p>

My previous internship experience was in a small subsidiary of a large company, so this was an extreme environment change. Working on the Global Brand Management team was an interesting experience especially since the tagline for the company had just changed so I got to witness the development of the brand around “The Power of We.” My role included working on the media planning for the fiscal year 2012. This involves a great deal of organizing information and connecting with media vendors to ensure all the information was correct. I definitely greatly improved my excel skills. Besides media planning, I also got to see various aspects of marketing by helping to fill in during a team member’s vacation and talking with various people throughout the company to learn their roles. The internship provided a great deal of hands on experience and exposure to areas of media and marketing that I had previously been unaware of, not to mention excellent networking opportunities with Avaya employees and vendors and a New York marketing conference. </p>

<p>The work experience gained this summer was unbelievable, and I highly recommend to future students that you take advantage of internships at any possible time; be it during the summer or even a semester or two at school if your schedule allows it.  I worked in New York City and lived in New Jersey, and while the commute can be brutal during the summer (or anytime, really, if your familiar with the city) the experience and exposure gained from interning at a major company negated the long travel hours to and from work, and helped me gain a great sense of responsibility and pride in taking an active part in the workforce.  Getting into the flow of work (waking up early, traveling to the city, going to bed early) helped get me into a routine that prepared me for life after college (I know, as scary as that sounds) and truly got me excited and ready for the endless possibilities that await me after graduation.  Besides looking great on your resume, interning in various fields also helps you get a taste for the work, and can help you decide for yourself whether or not it is an industry that you would be interested in working in the future.  I would recommend that you take full advantage of the opportunity to intern while you can, as it helps to prepare you for your future and decide for yourself what you want to do with yourself once college ends and the real world beckons.  </p>

He told workshop participants&#8211;which included students, faculty, and department alumni&#8211; that 90% of online community users are lurkers who never contribute, 9% of users contribute a little and 1% of users account for almost all of the action. And, of course, Justin urged <em>action</em>. Justin emphasized that today’s college students are primed for social networking because they grew up with technology, they live in a mobile society and they’re way ahead of older generations (who are busy catching up with the technology). And because students are already using all types of free social media, they can create a niche that will pay rewards.</p>
<p>To get started, Justin recommended doing what you love but doing it more publicly and then adding the web to the equation. He emphasized that branding yourself was important, as well as choosing an easy-to-remember name, being consistent, thinking ahead and getting your name out there. Justin also talked about his night job as one of the top New York City nightlife promoters. Using social networking to promote NYC nightlife and with his JustinRZB brand, he earns awards, cash and free passes to the city&#8217;s truly <strong>hot</strong> spots.  In the end, he challenged students to consider “Where do you fit in?”</p>

When I decided to major in Media and Communications, I knew that I would be encouraged to learn more than one specific trade such as film, television, or radio.  I learned how to think critically and analyze concepts far beyond the constraints of any particular subject.  I improved on my writing, reading, and (of course) communicating skills, applying what I had learned to aspects of campus within and beyond the classroom.</p>
<p>In Communications and Public Relations with Dr. Pooley, I was able to work on the event “15 Below 15th” taking students beyond the boundaries of campus and into the city of Allentown.  As a Jewish Studies minor and a DANA Scholar, I created an independent study researching the IJCU’s Youth and Prejudice Conference and approaches to teaching the Holocaust.  As a member of student activities, I initiated new programs that would keep students active and inspire many of them to become student leaders themselves. Now, as a newly-appointed staff member at Hillel, I am thrilled at the opportunity to continue educating and building a community that has taught me so much.</p>
<p>While finding a job has been a difficult task for our graduating class, I’ve found that what I learned at Muhlenberg through the classes I took and the activities I was involved in more than prepared me for future opportunities. Sarah</p>
