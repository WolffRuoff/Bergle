								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Did they have computers when you were younger, or were they still using feathers and ink?” While I do not remember my 5 year-old self asking this question, my mother and siblings will not let me live it down. A world without technology seems like a lifetime ago; a lifetime I have never experienced.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">            For as long as I can remember, I have lived in a tech world. From the time I wake up in the morning, until the time I go to bed, I am constantly utilizing technology. “Teens ages 13 to 17 are also going online frequently. Aided by the convenience and constant access provided by mobile, 92% of teens report going online daily – with 24% using the internet “almost constantly,” 56% going online several times a day and 12% reporting once-a-day use” (Lenhart). In the matter of seconds the world is at my fingertips connecting me to everyone and everything I could ever imagine plus more. My life, for all intent and purposes, revolves around technology. From my smartphone to my laptop and wireless printer, my video games to my tablet I spend a majority of my life and waking hours using some form of technology.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">            My experience with technology began at a very young age. At the mere age of 4 I was enrolled in a computer class. While the class did not go into depth about computers and all that could be done with these devices, it did expose me to a world that would become commonplace later in life. As I grew I graduated from computer games, to Nintendo Gameboys to PSPs and currently Xbox One it allowed me to take my gaming mobile. Everywhere I went my device came with me. I never thought twice about it, and it seemed like I was not the only one. Everywhere I went I was surrounded by others enamored with (not to mention glued to) their devices&#8211; parents on their cell phones, children on Gameboys, employees on their computers. Technology was all around me and as I grew it only surrounded me more, tightening its grasp and allure.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">            As I matured so did my relationship with technology. With each new technological advancement my world grew larger, my reach became broader and the endless possibilities available to me became more abundant. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">            My family went from a household with a communal phone attached to the wall and a single desktop computer that would require us to plug into the phone line, leaving the phone incapacitated during use to laptops and smartphones connected over Wi-Fi for all and tremendous independence. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> With age I have begun to better appreciate all the benefits the ever expanding world of technology offers me. Devices such as GoogleDocs has been incredibly beneficial to me in my studies throughout high school and now in college. In many of my classes over the years I noticed an increased focus on group projects being assigned to me by my teachers which posed a challenge to me. Being the 3 sport athlete that I was throughout high school, it was not always easy finding time to meet up with my other group members to work on our assignment together. To make things easier on everyone we typically did work through GoogleDocs so that we could collaboratively work on our different parts of the project when time allowed while also enabling us to help and critique other members of the group through GroupMe. The ease of accessibility for everyone enabled more work to get done while not wasting other group members because I could not physically be there to work on the assignment with them. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Frankly, I cannot imagine a world without technology. A failure to maintain a keen knowledge of all forms of technology will undoubtedly present challenges and a loss of opportunities in almost all aspects of my life. I don’t<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>intend to pass those opportunities by.</span></p>
