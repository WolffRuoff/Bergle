					<description><![CDATA[Pandora is an interesting case for Internet radio, Group 2, but you&#039;ve left out one key aspect of Pandora&#039;s profit model: it relies on advertising for revenue - both text advertising and audio advertising.  In this sense, the Pandora revenue model differs very little from the broadcast radio model, except for the fact that users can select their own artists and songs.  Is Pandora also monetizing this aspect of the business as well?  For instance, is Pandora marketing information about users&#039; choices of artists and songs back to the record companies?  This type of information would be interesting to explore if you planned on utilizing this example for your in-class presentation.  As I mentioned in my comments on your first post, see if you can provide some analysis of each article utilizing Turow&#039;s power roles framework.  This will provide some much-needed context for each article that you select.  Please let me know if you have questions about this.]]></description>
