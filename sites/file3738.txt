					<description><![CDATA[Good job here, Group 1 - You took an article that didn&#039;t necessarily have that much to do with the business of selling records and crafted a nice analysis around it.  My guess is that the music industry is probably less overtly hostile to GLBT issues as a social and political matter, but that the decision-making around new talent and public perception is probably what fuels the caution surrounding GLBT issues.  So, as we talked about in class, since most media products fail in the marketplace, producers attempt to keep as close as possible to the ideological and cultural middle ground to maximize their potential sales in the marketplace.  Anything that disrupts this - a new artist publicly &quot;coming out&quot;, for instance - would have potential negative consequences for the bottom line for record companies.  The Clay Aiken example can be applied here as well.  This can definitely be related to the notion of keeping to the dominant status quo in media production.  Nice job here.]]></description>
