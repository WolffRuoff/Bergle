								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Digital Natives  was coined by Mark Prensky in 2001 (Vodanovich, Sudaram, Myers, 2010). “It is more specifically defined as those who have grown up in a  world where the use of information and communications technology is pervasive, ubiquitous and where information and communication technologies are used in an organizational and non organizational context” (Vodanovich, Sudaram, Myers, 2010). I have always found the topic of digital natives to be incredibly fascinating. The reason for this is because last year I started babysitting three boys that lived next door to me. I remember thinking to myself the task was going to be incredibly difficult because of the level of activity required to babysit three little boys. To my surprise it was actually incredibly easy. All they wanted to do was play on their I-pads. When I was younger I was constantly outside and I am considered to be a digital native. Now with the younger generation they are even more involved with technology than I was. In a way I found it sad that because their lives are so immersed with technology they may never understand the things that I came to love in my childhood. This leads me to think what are some of the things I missed out on in my childhood.</p>
<p>“Digital immigrants were not born into the digital world; rather they have learnt to engage with it in their adult lives” (Vodanovich, Sudaram, Myers, 2010). The major difference between the two is that digital natives were moulded by technology from a very young age. Digital Immigrants were people who later in life were immersed in the technology culture (Vodanovich, Sudaram, Myers, 2010). The skill set of the two can be completely different because of this. For example most digital immigrants are more comfortable with face to face communication or talking on the phone with someone then digital natives are (Vodanovich, Sudaram, Myers, 2010). This means that it is fair to assume that digital immigrants have better social skills than digital natives. Digital natives however are seen as more tech savvy then most adults. For example my five year old cousin is a lot better at using an I-pad than my Dad will ever be. I also found out from personal experience that digital immigrants seem to be more satisfied with the technology they have rather than yearning for the next best thing. My brother, sister and I always want the new phone coming out. However, my Mom and Dad still have the I-phone four and do not want to get a new upgrade. I think this goes back to the way technology has moulded us. We grew up in a generation were technology was constantly evolving and the next best thing was always considered the best. On the contrary my parents grew up without the same technology and do not value its importance as much as we do.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="control-box-wrapper">
<p>            The proliferation of new technology has brought to the national forefront a new form of bullying. Unlike traditional bullying, cyberbullying is a more insidious, prevalent and difficult to trace form of abuse and the number of cyberbullying incidents seem to be growing in epidemic proportions. With the burgeoning advancements in technology, people now have the ability to instantaneously communicate with others through various technological mediums&#8211;internet, text messaging, social networks, and video games. Consequently, this provides multiple forums for disseminating information and an outlet for hurling anonymous insults and harassing comments. Is there not a way to combat cyberbullying? So far, the answer seems to be no.  No one seems to be shielded from its reach.</p>
<p>Brittan Heller, the Anti-Defamation League’s first director of technology and society discusses her own personal experience, as well as, others experiences with cyberbullying in a recent article in the New York Times titled “What It’s Like to fight Online Hate” (2016). Heller, a Jewish American woman, was flooded with sexist anti-Semitic comments on her Twitter account just moments after the A.D.L announced her hire in early September. She understood that cyberbullying was prevalent in our environment today, but even she was amazed and troubled with the speed and maliciousness in which these attacks were made. Everywhere she turned she was confronted with images of swastikas taunting her about her Jewish heritage and death threats all because she was appointed to this incredibly prestigious position.</p>
<p>The mental and emotionally consequences suffered by countless numbers of cyberbullying victims are resulting long lasting effects. In today’s age technology allows a tormentor to go where bullies where afraid to go in the past. A crisis exists and it needs to be stopped.  If nothing is done soon, increasingly more and more people will be directly affected by this everyday creating a culture where you are forced to conceal your true feelings for fear of public scrutiny, ridicule and humiliation.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do you remember when people would talk face to face, make plans by asking another person if they had plans over the weekend, and interact in ways that did not include digital technology? Personally I do not remember, because I am a digital native and was essentially born with an iPhone in my right hand. Growing up in a society where technology was constantly changing, it was easy for me to adapt to the latest form of technology because I was surrounded by transforming technology, and in order to survive and do well in the society I was growing up in, I had to get used to the use of digital electronics. At a young age, I had learned to speak with people and feel comfortable interacting with others in face-to-face circumstances, but with the development of social media, email, instant messaging and texting, I knew that it was not going to be long before technology took over the world of communication.</p>
<p>I started using social media as a way to communicate with my peers in middle school. Since nobody had a cell phone, we would use email to send each other instant messages, mapping out our weekend plans, and where we would go after school. Not long after that, my friends and I would text each other, as it was easy to send a quick message and then go back to what you were doing. Before I could realize, the way that I communicated with others was permanently changed. I felt myself constantly checking my cell phone for any new text messages, repeatedly checking Facebook to see if any of my friends had posted a new status update. “Let’s use our imagination a bit. If the internet, mobile devices, and games were taken away from us, how would we feel? I know many of us would feel like a part of our life is missing due to technology now being a necessity in our everyday life.” When I did not have my phone on me, or I was not using a source of social media, I felt naked, disconnected, and as if I was missing out, and still feel that way today when I do not carry around my cell phone with me.</p>
<p>I have recognized over time that technology has taken away valuable communication skills from me, and that it is more difficult to hold a conversation with somebody for an extended period of time without checking my phone for new notifications. I also find myself preferring to make plans over text, rather than face-to-face communications. I have also realized that it is more difficult for myself and others to be as social and outgoing as we can potentially be because we are too dependent upon technology. Moving forward I plan on depending less on technology not because I am too dependent, but because it is affecting me as an individual and holding me back from reaching my full potential as a person.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In my senior year of high school, everything went digital. Every student was given an iPad that came with many educational apps. The most essential one was called eBackpack, which contains all of the worksheets and activities for each class. Every assignment was to be submitted digitally, and even some of my quizzes were digital. My grades peaked senior year, and to this day I still wonder if it is because of the iPads. Prior to senior year, I always had trouble keeping track of all of my papers. Not only was it a drag to carry a 6-pocket folder that was completely stuffed with papers, but <strong>on top of that</strong> I had to carry my notebooks and heavy textbooks. Once I got my iPad, the after school backaches went away by this environmentally friendly substitute.</p>
<p><em>Aside from saving trees, why else are technological advancements positive for educational systems? </em>Well according to Tiffani Pittman and Trudi Gaines, &#8220;technology can be an important tool used to enhance and expand the learner’s opportunities to interact with the environment by providing access to a virtual environment previously unavailable in real life and real time&#8221; (Pittman and Gaines 540). In their research study, Pittman and Gaines conducted a survey for 3rd, 4th, and 5th grade teachers in a Florida school district and concluded that there is a positive correlation between high-level technology use and &#8220;teachers’ attitudes and beliefs about the importance of technology integration and direct student access to computers within the classroom&#8221; (Pittman and Gaines 550). This conclusion is significant because it is important for teachers to be enthusiastic about integrating technology in the classroom in order to get the children to be enthusiastic.</p>
<p>Though this research is reliable, it is limited in that it doesn&#8217;t cover the negatives of technology in classrooms. One of which I found to be big senior year was that technology can be very distracting. It was very easy to make it look like you were doing work on your iPad. But in reality, you were playing Candy Crush.</p>

As we all know, in 1967, the first game system designed </span><span lang="EN-US">and named “Brown Box”. But the “Brown Box” didn’t sold well because the mismanaged and the fact that home gaming was a relatively alien concept to average American at that time. And how technology’</span><span lang="EN-US">s advancement and the increase </span><span lang="EN-US">of the gaming community changed this situation through the history?</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">In 1970s, the first example of players competing on separate screens came and made the gaming community bigger. Later, technological advancements such as Intel’s invention of the world’s first microprocessor made the home gaming became a reality. Recently, the invention of the personal computers and the appearance of Smartphone made the gaming became more convenience, diverse, and interesting. These changes not only make the gaming industries flower, but also change people life.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">It is hard for the people in 1970s to believe that nowadays more than 42 percent of Americans are gamers and four out of five U.S. households have a console. To see these changes in a positive way, the advance of the gaming really rich people’</span><span lang="EN-US">s life, satisfy the demand that people can never get from the reality, and relax people from the serious social pressure. But on the other hand,</span> <span lang="EN-US">the increase of the gaming community made the age of the gamers become smaller and smaller. And this is a very worrying thing because teens don’t have the ability to judge the right and wrong. I used to see the news that a fifteen years old teen killed his friend in a quarrel, when asked about the reason, he said: “I killed people who made me unhappy in the game, and don’t worry, he will soon resurrect.” </span><span lang="EN-US">What a lamentable thing! And the </span><span lang="EN-US">gaming also reduces the time that people spend on outdoor activities which is a bad thing for our health</span><span lang="EN-US">.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">About the </span><span lang="EN-US">future, because the technologies </span><span lang="EN-US">like virtual reality and artificial intelligence technology will make the gaming </span><span lang="EN-US">experience become more stimulating, interesting, authentic, how to protect ourselves from the gaming become a problem.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most people in today’s society know what cyber bullying and bullying are. Students have probably had assembly after assembly on why not to cyber bully and how it makes the person being bullied feel. However what really drew me to this article was that it was not simply a run down of why not to bully. It told the differences and similarities between the two. I thought that this was fascinating because this was information that had never really been explained to me before. I also believe that in order to try and stop something like bullying or cyberbullying you need to fully understand the two topics.</p>
<p>The biggest reason for bullying is because there is an imbalance of power. In other words bullying to me is making someone else feel small in order to make oneself feel better. This is why bullies select their victims very carefully in both cyber bullying and in normal bullying. “Both tend to target passive victims in which balance of power favors the bully”( Gale, 2016).  The character traits of the bully are also the same. “ Both involve harassment of a victim by an aggressor whose intent is to inflict harm” ( Gale, 2016). The main similarities between cyber bullying and bullying is the type of people that are bullied and the ones who bully. I found this incredibly interesting.</p>
<p>Some of the difference between bullying and cyber bullying I found quite unsettling. For example in cyber bullying people are not always sure of who their bully is. “This anonymity empowers many cyber bullies to continue antagonizing their victims” ( Gale, 2016). With bullying normal schoolyard bullying people can pinpoint exactly who is targeting them. With cyber bullying it could literally be anyone  and this is a hard pill to swallow. i cannot even imagine not even knowing who is causing trying to hurt them. This also makes the bully feel that they can’t get caught and make the threats more prevalent. With technology as well there is always access to the person. They can make threats twenty four seven. Cyber bullying is so much more dangerous than normal bullying for this reason. People get a sense of confidence behind the computer screen that is unwavering. They say things that they never would to a persons face.</p>
<p>Having now known the difference and similarities between bullying I feel i understand the topic of cyber bullying a lot more. I understand that it is not the people who are changing it is simply their access to the people being bullied that are changing. Cyberbullying is considered to be more detrimental as well. In my previous statement i concluded that it was not the people who were changing it was simply the method. If this is so its raises the question should we think of technology as more detrimental for young kids then beneficial?</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the article <em>The digital identity divide: how technology knowledge impacts college students</em> by Joanna Goode, the divides between technology usage of certain ethnic, gender, and socioeconomic groups. One thing that stood out was the fact that, regardless of race, lower income households had less technology exposure than households with a higher income. Students from those families do not have the “boost” in the job market and college search. With the common application online and many more colleges using it, those with the greater technological exposure have a greater chance to get the jobs and colleges they want. Even in school, the deficiency of technology usage is not harmful. The article talks about a girl named Lara. It reads: her “low technology proficiency haunts her academic career.” Most teachers assume that students automatically know how to use technology which may exclude some students. Although these students are not well versed in technology, they actively embrace it. Going back to Lara, the article reads: “this low level of technology knowledge did not translate into negative attitudes toward technology, however. She loves computers…” which means that these students may have an ability to accept new technology while the older generations are not as inclined to do so. This could link to the ability of younger people to pick up new things quickly while the old dogs aren’t able to learn those new tricks the puppies can. Fortunately, schools are getting better with teaching students to use technology more efficiently, albeit at a slower pace than technology is progressing but it’s progress none the less.</p>
