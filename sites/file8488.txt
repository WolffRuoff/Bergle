								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Look around you, look to your left, to your right, behind you and now back at yourself. Everyone you saw including yourself is a liar, we are all liars. While sitting at the dining hall, on the second floor enjoying my lunch one afternoon I noticed from a birds eye view all the different conversations people were having. I wasn’t eavesdropping, just to clarify but I did hear from up above, “No, that dress doesn’t make you look fat!” I wasn’t going to judge that girl on her response but it led me to wonder why people disguise the truth and how often they do it. I could not get my mind off this subject, thinking to myself how often I might be lied to on any given day and how I might be able to detect it. I went online, quickly flipping through article after article until I found a Ted talk entitled, “How to Spot a Liar” by Pamela Meyer. I was enlightened on what she had to say.</p>
<p>She answered all of the questions that flooded my head earlier that day, providing in depth explanations to the complexities of deception and how deception and lies can impact not only our social lives but our lives on a much bigger scale as well. There are a few elemental facts about lying, one being that it is a collegial action. Not every lie is catastrophic, but there are certainly many willing participants who take part in deception for the sake of their social dignity, i.e.: the case with the dress. These willing participants are the ones who kick start deception to a whole new level. Ones who constantly lie and manipulate may think that their wrong doing will impact only those directly involved but as we have seen in recent history that is not the case. Back in 2010 for example, Bernie Madoff deceived the entire nation single handedly into just under trillions of dollars in debt. It is the unwilling participants who are affected most and lies like these so evidently betray our country by jeopardizing security and undermining our government.</p>
<p>We are all opposed to lying, but frequently do it in so many different ways. What’s astonishing is that you could potentially be lied to up to 200 times in any given day (Meyer). And even worse, strangers lie about 3 times within the first 10 minutes of meeting each other (Meyer). And on top of that, by the time kids reach college they lie to their mom on average 1 out of every 5 interactions !(Meyer). Now that makes me feel like a terrible son. Lies and deception occur everywhere, we encounter unavoidable spam in our emails, fake digital friends on Facebook, identity thieves and Ponzi schemes and it is all because our world is changing faster than we could have ever anticipated. Meyer said “it’s transparent with blogs and social networks broadcasting the buzz of a whole new generation of people that have made a choice to live their lives in public” (Meyer).  We complain about privacy rights and manipulative media but we are the ones deceiving one another. The advanced new world texting and tweeting blind us to the basic subtleties of human decency.</p>
<p>Take another look around the room, the people and yourself deserve an honorable society where truth can be heightened and promoted and one where deception is publicized.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I know I am technically supposed to postpone my judgment until after analyzing a piece of text, but as I started reading a chapter from the book, Born Digital by John G Palfrey I couldn’t help but notice that the chapter I chose to read was called “Pirates”. So as I began reading silently too myself, all I could think was, “This author is crazy, is he really attempting to call my generation pirates, ones who lie and steal and kill?” Turns out Palfrey did a pretty good job in persuading me,  I hate to admit it but yeah, we are all pirates when it comes to the digital world whether we accept it or not.</p>
<p>You may ask yourself why this is, and think that you do nothing wrong while on the internet and that may be the case, like it is for many people. However, the digital world has changed faster than anyone could have ever imagined and it simply wasn’t ready for the wave of our generation to step in. Palfrey says regarding the digital natives, “With so many forms of media available in digital formats, Digital Natives are breaking new creative ground” (Palfrey, 131). My judgment immediately kicked in again and I thought to myself, “Hey, he’s finally saying something nice about my generation!” All that we do in our daily lives, like surf the web, listen to music, or socialize with millions of other people were unimaginable just a few years ago and this new technology that we were born into allows us to grow up in a creative atmosphere. Here, Palfrey states, “Creativity, is the upside of this brave new world of digital media” (Palfrey, 132). But with every upside there is always a counterpart. The downsides to this atmosphere sometimes even outweigh those upsides. A detrimental downside is today’s violation of copy right laws. Palfrey claims that the vast majority of Digital Natives are breaking copy right laws on a regular basis. The emergence of new technologies and the easy access to violate copy right laws took everyone by surprise and led corporations to conclude that something had to be done to protect these laws and to punish those who do not cooperate with them. In doing so leads our growing digital era to a cross roads. Are the digital natives creative and helpful or destructive and relentless?</p>
<p>Pirates are neither creative nor helpful, so in essence Palfrey’s claim is that our generation is destructive, but why? The chapter “Pirates” discussed a controversy I found to be very interesting regarding the epidemic of file sharing that occurred in the early 2000s. Napster was the head dog in this battle that eventually caused major corporations to re think copy right laws. You may have heard of Napster before but for those that haven’t, it was a new form a software developed so music could be shared easily and for free over the internet. What entailed from this was that the sales of CD’s and albums sharply declined, devastating the economy of the music industry. Aside from shortages in sales, Napster and many other “P2P” sites committed large scale copy right infringements. No matter how hard the music industry try’s to shut down the P2P file sharing sites they will never die because their popularity among the Digital Natives is bigger than law itself. Now a day’s how many people actually are buying CD’s and albums? Not many, as social norms drive this ongoing piracy. To fully comprehend this file sharing epidemic we have to understand social norms which regulate human behavior more than anything. We were all taught at a young age to comply with social norms of all sorts, such as “sharing nicely” or “saying please and thank you”. Napster kick started this wave of piracy among the Digital natives from a very early age making copy right infringement the “normal thing to do”. Also having not learned about them from an early age, the majority of Digital Natives are very confused about the intricacies of copy right laws. A necessary solution is to teach the importance of copy right at a young age and not strangle the creativity of our worlds Digitals Natives by strengthening the laws themselves.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As online social networking sites are expanding their popularity, a phenomenon termed “Facebook envy” seems to be on the rise (Appel, 2015). The frustration of logging on to Facebook and being flooded with endless pictures, status updates and friends’ notifications showing what seems to be their perfect lives is one way to describe Facebook envy. This problem has been faced by all Facebook users since 2006 yet still, there is very few research investigating how envy can lead to many other very real physiological effects. Envy and jealousy go hand and hand with depression, yet little is known about the mechanisms underlying this connection. In the “Journal of Social &amp; Clinical Psychology, Vol. 34” a quasi-experimental study entitled, “Social Comparison, Envy, and Depression on Facebook” discusses how Facebook is a high-risk environment for depressed individuals and investigates the severity to which envy harms Facebooks 1 billion users.</p>
<p>In this study, depressed and non-depressed individuals were asked to describe their current levels of self-esteem and were then assigned and compared to a specific Facebook profile. These profiles were either attractive or unattractive and each participant compared themselves to the owner of the profile they were assigned and they reported their resulting feelings. I am sure each feeling was different than the other, yet feelings of envy were the most popular among all test subjects. The original hypothesis for this experiment was that the depressed individuals were expected to feel inferior and more envious, particularly when paired up with an attractive Facebook profile (Appel, 2015). The experiment was also expected to demonstrate how envy can be correlated with low self-esteem, and depressiveness in social comparison.</p>
<p>Social comparison on Facebook is an ongoing process that appears to be the major cause in online envy. This is all a result of Facebooks impression management which allows its users to select, edit and post pictures that misrepresent the truth behind each user’s life (Appel, 2015). This study does a fantastic job in showing how envy is created and why it is harmful. The results were written down, participants were compared to one another and it turns out that resulting envy was higher after seeing an attractive profile. Also, among depressed participants the jealousy experienced was higher than any other. Both results yielded p-values well below zero which gives us strong evidence to conclude that when depressed individuals meet Facebooks misrepresented profiles, the result is in fact envy.</p>
<p>We know by now that Facebook’s boastful atmosphere makes it a very hostile environment for depressed individuals (Appel, 2015).  The results of this experiment shed a new light on the mechanisms underlying the connection between depression and Facebook envy. With this new information, Facebook and many other social networks alike should realize the dangers their users face on a daily basis. Since online social media are already a part of most people’s lives today, interventions must take place soon in order to silence the dangers surrounding the media.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Facebook is a social media website used by over 500 million different people. It connects the world and brings people closer together but pushes people further apart at the same time.</p>
<p>Do you ever get jealous of that kid with that really cool house? Or that girl who has it all, nice clothes, shoes and jewelry? Imagine that jealousy and multiply it by thirty. Doesn’t feel too good does it? Kids on Facebook today are envious and some very unhappy due to the exposure of positive, yet misrepresented highlights from their peers. The reason I say multiply your jealousy by thirty is because online the jealousy is everywhere, there’s no getting around it, there’s no way out. Three hundred and forty eight. That is the average number of friends each Facebook user has. That is three hundred and forty eight people who display on Facebook only the positive aspects of their lives while keeping the negative out of reach of the internet and hidden within themselves. The distorted view Facebook users’ get of their friends has them logging off at night doubting themselves and not appreciating everything in their lives. This creates a sort of envy firing up in the stomachs of Facebooks many users. And while this type of envy not only has Facebook users drooling over what others have that they don’t have, it has profound effects on other aspects of life as well. The dangers of Facebook may even come from within the users themselves as the article states, “Facebook can lead to severe depression, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-hatred">self-loathing</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rage_(emotion)">rage</a> and hatred, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resentment">resentment</a>, feelings of inferiority and insecurity, pessimism, suicidal tendencies and desires, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_isolation">social isolation</a>, and other issues that can prove very serious” (Wikipedia, 2015). The problems quoted above are all very real. Depression, personal resentment, insecurities and suicidal tendencies are no joke. For the social networking site that supposedly better connects the world it certainly connects these mental health issues first hand to its users. Facebook needs to take immediate action with regards to fixing its web of endless jealousy. What appears to be a harmless photo of somebody’s vacation to the Bahamas or the new car a friend got for their birthday can turn into much worse. These photos mislead Facebook users into thinking negatively about themselves, harming their physical and mental state of being.  It has been generated from studies over the conflict of Facebook envy that at least 1 and 3 users leave the site feeling less satisfied with their lives (Wikipedia, 2015).  Facebook needs to act and act fast on this issue, because if Facebook wishes to expand even further, that entails bringing Facebook envy to the next level. And I strongly believe young Facebook users have been through enough already.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Even with the dangerous persuasion of social networking sites, along with the anonymity and individualistic power there is online today, the vast majority of our worlds digital users still shy away from understanding what really is hidden within “The Cloud”. In my article entitled, “Influence of Social Media on Teenagers” written by Suren Ramasubbu, many of the realistic threats of the internet are looked at in comparison with the benefits new technologies have to offer. We all know that social media can broaden social connections throughout the world and may seem harmless as advertised thousands of times per day but what isn’t shown are the life altering repercussions in both professional and personal areas of life.</p>
<p>The real problem is right in front of us. Facebook depression, Internet addiction, cyber bullying, sleep deprivation, obesity and sexting are just a few of the things that should call for the attention and be recognized as a major problem in our world today. Ramasubbu affirmatively states, “The lack or difficulty in self-regulation and susceptibility to peer pressure makes adolescents vulnerable to such evils as <a href="http://guilfordjournals.com/doi/abs/10.1521/jscp.2014.33.8.701">Facebook depression</a>, sexting, and cyberbullying, which are realistic threats” (Ramasubbu, 2015, p.1.). Our youth’s vulnerability can lead to much more than just an occasional blog post or tweet. The consequences of cyberbullying can be life altering. Ramasubbu made a very interesting point in that the two kinds of people who are likely to be cyberbullies are the popular ones and those on the fringes of society. Many technologies today have the power to disconnect children from reality. It is those people who then feel invincible hiding their insecurities behind their 20 inch laptop computer screen to go out and hurt somebody else’s life. It becomes very ironic how the individualistic nature of social networking can make it difficult to recognize a victim of cyberbullying. Not only does social networking give adolescents the power to bully behind a computer screen but it hides those being bullied as well. Ramasubbu closes his argument by saying, “Adolescence is the time for teens to spread their wings and take the tentative first flight out into the world…” (Ramasubbu, 2015, p.1.). He encourages teens to make a productive leap into the world, and not the digital world. He advocates that teens must learn to understand what the internet has to offer and how these things can both positively and negatively impact society.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are many life skills that are essential for survival in our world today. You may find yourself asking right about now what those life skills might be? Just take a minute to think. You probably came up with ideas such as knowing how to swim, or even riding a bike. But did you even think of the things that are more essential such as reading and writing? If not, writer Mike Hanski of the Huffington post might throw his hands up in frustration. The simple skills of reading and writing have the power to bring out who you truly are and what you might aspire to be one day. Overlooking these two skills and forgetting the impact they can have is detrimental. Reading and writing are the driving force in achieving one’s goals and dreams.</p>
<p>In the article “Want to Be a Better Writer? Read More”, Mike Hanski illustrates a scarcity of inspiration and motivation harming the youth of America. Children and many adults today simply do not see the importance in reading and how it can benefit their lives. Well, for starters, Hanski says, “…the more you read at school, the better your vocabulary and cognitive skills become” (Hanski, 2014 p.2). Aside from improving your vocabulary, Hanski also explains how reading can help you overcome stress, increase empathy and on top of that reading can infinitely expand your general view of this world! Reading books and stories not only allow you to travel to other places and other worlds, but they open up a gateway into your own world and imagination.</p>
<p>Now if you are reading this and still see no reason to “waste your time reading” Mike Hanski’s article was written just for you. In his article he does a fantastic job using positive words that hook his readers into thinking “hey I guess reading isn’t that bad after all”. Hanski opens up his article by saying, “Reading is fashionable. Again. It’s cool…” (Hanski, 2014 p.1).  His use of the words “fashionable” and “cool” is to prove that reading should be as popular today as using Facebook or watching TV. On the contrary, Hanski delivers the message that not reading or writing can result in unemployment and illiteracy. His persuasive language throughout the article, both positive and negative relay the importance of these two life skills that should never be overlooked.</p>
