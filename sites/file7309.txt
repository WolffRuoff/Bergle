								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Digital Natives  was coined by Mark Prensky in 2001 (Vodanovich, Sudaram, Myers, 2010). “It is more specifically defined as those who have grown up in a  world where the use of information and communications technology is pervasive, ubiquitous and where information and communication technologies are used in an organizational and non organizational context” (Vodanovich, Sudaram, Myers, 2010). I have always found the topic of digital natives to be incredibly fascinating. The reason for this is because last year I started babysitting three boys that lived next door to me. I remember thinking to myself the task was going to be incredibly difficult because of the level of activity required to babysit three little boys. To my surprise it was actually incredibly easy. All they wanted to do was play on their I-pads. When I was younger I was constantly outside and I am considered to be a digital native. Now with the younger generation they are even more involved with technology than I was. In a way I found it sad that because their lives are so immersed with technology they may never understand the things that I came to love in my childhood. This leads me to think what are some of the things I missed out on in my childhood.</p>
<p>“Digital immigrants were not born into the digital world; rather they have learnt to engage with it in their adult lives” (Vodanovich, Sudaram, Myers, 2010). The major difference between the two is that digital natives were moulded by technology from a very young age. Digital Immigrants were people who later in life were immersed in the technology culture (Vodanovich, Sudaram, Myers, 2010). The skill set of the two can be completely different because of this. For example most digital immigrants are more comfortable with face to face communication or talking on the phone with someone then digital natives are (Vodanovich, Sudaram, Myers, 2010). This means that it is fair to assume that digital immigrants have better social skills than digital natives. Digital natives however are seen as more tech savvy then most adults. For example my five year old cousin is a lot better at using an I-pad than my Dad will ever be. I also found out from personal experience that digital immigrants seem to be more satisfied with the technology they have rather than yearning for the next best thing. My brother, sister and I always want the new phone coming out. However, my Mom and Dad still have the I-phone four and do not want to get a new upgrade. I think this goes back to the way technology has moulded us. We grew up in a generation were technology was constantly evolving and the next best thing was always considered the best. On the contrary my parents grew up without the same technology and do not value its importance as much as we do.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A big topic of discussion in our FYS class this year have been about digital natives and digital immigrants.  Digital natives are those to whom were born in the current generation and have special qualities in today&#8217;s digital society.  Digital immigrants are the those to whom were born before the arrival of digital technologies, the generation before the current generation (Chaves, Maia Filho &amp; Melo 2016).  I wanted to delve further into this topic of study because I find it fascinating that digital immigrants can have more knowledge about digital technology then digital natives.  In today&#8217;s society, digital technology is popular to say the least.  Digital natives today are like &#8220;digital animals&#8221;; they are hungry for the newest piece of technology to emerge.  My parents, known as digital immigrants, never experienced a technological outburst like our generation has today.  Yes, digital immigrants had televisions, radios, computers, and telephones.  However, in today&#8217;s digital society, there is a television, a radio, a computer, a telephone, and applications for different types of social media and games all in one 5.44 inch by 2.64 inch device.  Digital Natives have had the luxury to be introduced to digital technologies like the iPhone and the iPad in their current generation as kids because of how convenient and useful these products are.  Digital immigrants have had the luxury to be introduced  to these products as adults; however, they are less fortunate because these digital technologies were not invented in their generation.  Although this is the case, it does not mean that digital natives know more information about how to use these digital technologies, and these digital technologies do not necessarily help kids with learning education.  Margaryan, Littlejohn and Vojt (2011) decided to conduct study to seek which technological products are used by digital immigrants and by digital natives to investigate the perceptions of the educational value of technology tools as well as the motivations for the use of certain types of technology (Chaves, Maia Filho &amp; Melo 2016). After they collected their data, the research team concluded that &#8220;from the analysis of quantitative and qualitative data the authors maintain that there is no evidence that the current generation of students adopt radically learning styles exhibiting new forms of literacy from the use of sophisticated technologies. In fact, the attitudes of students in regard to learning, seems to be influenced more by the teaching methods used by teachers&#8221; (Chaves, Maia Filho &amp; Melo 2016).  Therefore, digital natives do not adopt new learning styles from digital technologies; they learn more from their parents, teachers, coaches, etc.  This means that digital natives learn more from digital immigrants than they do from digital natives themselves and the digital technologies they use.  Digital immigrants are older and wiser than digital natives.  As a result, even though adults are known as &#8220;digital immigrants&#8221; it does not mean that digital natives know more about digital technologies then digital immigrants.  In fact, digital immigrants can help digital natives with digital technologies because they are smarter and wiser.  On the other hand, digital natives can also help digital immigrants with technologies they are not familiar with.  The help of digital technologies between digital natives and digital technologies go hand in hand.  To conclude, digital immigrants can be seen as wiser than digital natives, and digital natives cam be more familiar with digital technologies, therefore both digital immigrants and digital natives can help each other with the new digital technologies in today&#8217;s generation.</p>
