								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In ‘It&#8217;s Complicated: The Social Lives of Networked Teens’, Danah Boyd the author, clarifies answers to the generational question of why do teens act the way they do online? Digital natives, being mostly teenagers these days, use social media as a way of creating and expressing their identity. But what does is lost in translation is who these teens believe are viewing their online persona.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One thing teens think of less often than not when posting to social media is the context collapse that they are faced with. This refers to the effects of social media and the infinite audience that is possible online as opposed to the limited groups a person normally interacts with. Sometimes it is easy to forget that just because we think we have control over who is viewing our content we actually don’t. This can bring about severe misinterpretations because our perceived audience is not always what we believe it to be. Teens these days are getting lost in the realm of imagined audiences rather than actual audiences. Every Time teens log onto social media they are faced with the notion of having an invisible audience. They know who they want their content to reach but simultaneously have no control over it. Consequences of these misinterpretations are especially exaggerated when it comes to things such as the college application. Possible applicants are usually warned to clean up their social media footprint in hopes of leaving no possibility of an unintended interpretation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When we are faced with an invisible audience we refer in our head to who we wish to appeal to but that invisible audience that exists can mean anything from teachers to childhood friends that are actually viewing our content. Some teens recognize that with applications such as Facebook and its increasing ability to connect people with one another, even with privacy settings, content reaches people much further than just those who they have accepted as friends or decide to follow, only increasing the invisible audience. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So next time you decide update the persona you hold online, whether that be with pictures or a status, think about who is actually seeing who you are online and decide if what you are putting online is worth the consequence of not always knowing who will be viewing it. </span></p>
