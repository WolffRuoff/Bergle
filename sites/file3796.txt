					<description><![CDATA[The idea that local radio stations are lifelines during weather emergencies is a good one, Group 2, but I would be careful about what sources you are using for these blog posts.  So, this online source you&#039;re citing here is not a trade magazine for the radio industry (like Broadcasting and Cable, for instance), but instead the website for an individual industry analyst who sells his consulting services to the broadcasting industry - not necessarily an independent, disinterested source.  So, in future posts, I would urge you to look for trade magazines for the radio industry instead.  This means taking a look at some of the articles in Billboard, or even a source like &quot;Friday Morning Quarterback&quot;, which you can find here: http://www.fmqb.com/home.asp - Or Inside Radio, which you can find here: http://www.insideradio.com/default.asp

Each of these would be a better fit for this blogging assignment than simply hitting up Google Search and grabbing things.  I also recommend that you use the handout from Jen Jarson to help you utilize the online databases like Business Source Elite for your blog posts.  Once you find a good article, then see if you can wrap in some analysis of what is going on by linking it to Turow&#039;s power roles framework.  This means that it will be most advantageous if you read ahead to the chapter about the radio industry in the textbook.  Let me know if you have any questions about my expectations for the blog posts and I&#039;ll be happy to talk with you about it!]]></description>
