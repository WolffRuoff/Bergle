					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;It was an honor to call Tom Mendham my friend.  He “volunteered” me for so many things that we laughed about, his penchant to keep me busy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We served on the Board of Trustees for a long time and were Fraternity Brothers at ATO.  He was a tireless worker for Muhlenberg College and ATO as he sought to improve the Financial Foundation of both.  When a severe problem arose with our Governance, Tom stood shoulder to shoulder with those of us who moved the college to a better place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those of us who were fortunate to talk to him frequently, knew of his health difficulties, but we really didn’t fully understand the severity of this struggle.  As we became more aware of this and the courage he displayed, all who knew him were inspired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our affection for Tom could not be complete without noting the tremendous devotion and efforts of Harriet who “stood by her man” as a great example of what a life partnership can be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tom may be in a better place now, but he will always be present in our lives – every Jag car will remind us of him.  His upbeat personality will serve all who search for a model of loyalty and purpose for Muhlenberg.&lt;/p&gt;
