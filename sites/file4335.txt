					<div class="entry-content">
				<p>While I am aware that finals have been over for about a week, I have taken some time out from relaxing and celebrating the holiday to look back on the crazy week of finals. And you know the funny thing is, it was not so bad. So that had me wondering why. I realized that  I was able to do a couple of things to make sure that I made it through finals week in one piece. I would like to offer a couple of tips now:</p>
<p><strong>Tip #1:</strong> <strong>Have fun while studying</strong>: I know this sounds absurd but it is possible. If you have friends who can focus when they need to but can also provide a fun and lighter atmosphere in the room that is always good. Whenever I felt a little stressed, I could talk to a couple of my friends, crack a few jokes and get that boost I needed to keep working.</p>
<p><strong>Tip #2: Figure out <span style="text-decoration: underline;">where</span> to study: </strong>I realized that I can study with a couple of people around me who are also studying but not with too many people. Sometimes the library is a great place to study but during finals week I need someplace that I will not get easily distracted by anything around me. When I see just a couple of friends around me working, that motivates me to keep going.</p>
<p><strong>Tip #3: Take Breaks</strong>: And not trying to take breaks for one class by studying for another class. At some point your brain will stop taking in information and then you will be wasting time. I learned that the hard way. I have now found when it is good to take breaks and the best way to do it without getting too distracted. Watch 1 episode of a TV. Go and get frozen yogurt. Do some coloring. Go for a drive. Decorate for the holidays. There are many fun, little things to do to take your mind off of studying and possibly even relax.</p>

<p><strong>Tip#4: Bring food to where you are working:</strong> I am always hungry when I am studying and I end up spending a lot of time going to get food and making it. By preparing for the week ahead, I was happy that I brought more food than I thought I needed to where I was studying because I ended up getting hungry and wanted something to snack on. My best advice is just to try to make sure that snack is not tons of mini cupcakes. 🙂</p>
<p>Just some tips that I have used throughout the years to get me through a week that is pretty crazy. Now that it is over, I can sit back and watch holiday specials, drink hot cocoa and enjoy one of the most wonderful times of the year.</p>

				<p>I am home safe in Connecticut, and it is officially safe to say that I have recovered from exams. Cure: sleep, a few home-cooked meals, and some good ole family time. My family leaves on Friday to vacation in Lake Placid, NY! Lake Placid was home to the Olympics in 1980, and the U.S hockey team won the gold that year! It is a pretty neat place and it is one of my family&#8217;s favorite places to visit. We will be home just in time for Christmas&#8230; although, around the house, it is certainly starting to look a lot like Christmas.</p>

				<p>After a long journey through many airports, I have made it safely home. I’m only just beginning to experience all the reverse culture shock that we were warned we might experience. It is sincerely challenging to attempt to talk about my semester abroad, but more challenging than talking about these transformative three months is describing the smaller moments. How do I convey to other people who “Yohannah” is? I can tell them he was kind and cheerful, sage and pensive and always greeted you with “Aaaaloooo”, but that’s not Yohannah, not even close.</p>
<p>How does one respond to “How was Africa?” Good? Awesome? Great? All adjectives that might apply, but don’t say anything about anything. Each day I spent in Tanzania and Kenya deserves its own moment, its own stories to be told. In preparing myself to come back to the states, I told myself that people were going to say things that are honestly good intentioned, but may really bother me. I don’t want to be that presumptuous guy offended over something that was said in good humor because I’ve “experienced so much more than you” or whatever. Still, when people say “Welcome back to civilization” I can’t help but get a little irritated. Civilization? As though Kenya and Tanzania are something other than civilization? Surely, whoever would say that to me doesn’t mean the countries are uncivilized, but rather that I was in a more rural, remote area of a country and now I’m right back into a suburb of NYC. Yes, I get that. So then why can’t I help being miffed by comments in that vein?</p>
<p>When I saw these two countries and met the people of them, I won’t say I was downright surprised, but that’s only because I had an extremely unhindered mindset entering the experience. I didn’t know what I was expecting at all. However, if I had to guess, I bet I’d have been surprised by the cultures, the countries, the animals and the people. I know everyone who will want to hear about my trip would also most likely be surprised as well, but I can’t give them that experience and I can’t explain a culture or a people or anything like that in words and still do it justice. On top of that, how many people who ask about the trip will only want to hear me say “Great. Saw tons of lions, here’s a few pictures” and how many sincerely want to hear me say “You may fall on your knees with tears in your eyes, heartbeats thrumming with the pounding of a million drummers and gaze upon the endless plains and still not yet begin to understand the freedom of the wilderness” how many will be able to devote the time and effort to understanding who I am and who I have become? That’s silly to ask of everyone, and it would again be presumptuous to ask people not to ask about my trip unless they’re ready for an ongoing dialogue about these kinds of things. People have their own lives, and above all, nobody wants to be told that they just can’t understand something. How to make them understand that it’s no shortcoming of theirs or mine, just an inadequacy of words to properly convey feelings and ideas? It’s like saying “I know this really great secret and I wish I could tell you but you wouldn’t understand”.</p>
<p>Sitting at the fire pit, watching the dying embers of hundreds of sheets of notes and research papers, management plans and charts that we set alight in celebration of the end of the semester’s classes, a girl turned to me and shared the common sentiment that she knew it would be frustrating when a million little moments were incommunicable to those she loved back home. It got me to thinking, and we talked about it. In the end, it seems, I’ll probably be able to convey a lot of the experiences I’ve had at face value. And as for the little things, the moments watching the sun set on the Serengeti, or the changes in who I am and what I care about, those are things that maybe I can’t ever communicate to someone who wasn’t there with me, but maybe those are things that are meant to be my own, and only mine, forever. Perhaps some things don’t translate into words for me because there are things that I need to hold onto for myself and in their silence, let them be.</p>

				<p>He’s the big boss man of the camp, the head honcho. Dr. Moses Okello is a stout, jolly man who is far wiser than most his age. At our thanksgiving party, we were all going up and sharing a talent. Knowing that Okello often gave really good speeches, we urged him (half-jokingly) to go up to the front of the room and tell us a story. To our surprise, he obliged with only a few moments’ urging. He looked at the floor for a few seconds, explaining that he was gathering himself and trying to figure what story he’d tell. He wanted to talk about his time in grad school in Idaho.</p>
<p>Finally settling on a story, what he told us went a little like this:</p>
<p>“This is about my time in America. When I went to grad school, I stayed in a little town. One night I was out looking for M&amp;Ms and strawberry wine coolers. I wanted a 6-pack but did you know they usually only sell them in 4-packs? So anyway, I was looking for a place that sold 6-packs because on that night I wanted to get disorderly and sing African songs and nobody would really know what I was saying. You see I was chocolatey and nobody else in the town was.</p>
<p>I went into a small gas station convenience store, and I was walking back through the section where I could get alcohol so that I could get disorderly and sing in my language. I saw this little girl and when she looked up at me I said ‘Hello’, but she just started to cry and make a lot of noise. So I turned around a little and I thought to myself ‘What is this little girl crying about?’. Then I realized it must be me; maybe this little girl had never seen a chocolatey person before, and I had never really noticed that I was chocolatey but I guessed then that I was, and everyone else in the town was not. So I was standing there with my wine in my hands and this little girl is crying and I don’t know what to do.</p>
<p>I sat down next to her and I asked her why she was crying and she pointed at my skin, which as you can see is very chocolatey. So I wondered how I can explain this to this girl who probably never saw someone like me before. I thought for a little while and then I asked her if she had a garden at home. She told me that she did. I asked if she had a lot of pretty different colored flowers in the garden. She agreed that she did, and that made the garden very pretty. So I told her that the person who made human beings was also a gardener and he liked flowers of all different colors, and that made his garden very beautiful. Then I looked up and her mom had come and I thought ‘Oh boy what can I do, I have made her daughter cry’. But the little girl looked up at her mother and said ‘Mommy is that true?’ and her mother was crying and she nodded and said ‘Yes it’s true’. And I ended up staying with that family in one of their extra rooms for many months while I finished grad school.”</p>
<p>He seriously just dropped this awesome story with no notice at all. The whole thing gets cooler though, because I finally got my mail that my family had intended to reach me by thanksgiving yesterday. In the envelope were two drawings of turkeys made by my little cousins with little notes written to me. On the back they had written stories about Thanksgiving. This was my cousin Livia’s story verbatim:</p>
<p>“Once upon a time. there was a turkey named Samme. He lived in Africa with his friends and family. Sammy got made fun of all the time because his feathers were blank. They had no color. They were plain white. Sammy was so ashamed of his feathers. The tried many ways to hide his feathers but none of them worked. One day, Sammy decided to run away. He ran and ran until he couldn’t take another step. When he took a breath, he saw some odd looking birds. They were all different shapes and sizes. They all were different in there own way. That’s when Sammy relized that he shouldn’t have to be ashamed anymore. Everyone is different in there own way. Then, Sammy went back home and no matter what people said, he knew he was special in his own way.”</p>

				<p>As I take on my first finals week of college, I was surprised to find that I was a little less stressed than I thought I would be! Here are the top 10 things reducing my stress this week:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Free Cupcakes!</strong><br />
When I went to Java Joe to get a coffee, I saw that Lyn, the owner of Java Joe had made Christmas themed cupcakes for anyone who wanted a sugary study break.</li>
<li><strong>Workshops and Tutors</strong><br />
All of my classes are under 15 people with the exception of my Intro to Psychology class, which has about 40 people. Because it is an intro class, we have a learning assistant who leads optional workshops twice a week. I also decided that I wanted to get a tutor. All I had to do was turn in a sheet with my name and the class I wanted to be tutored in and&#8230;voila! It has been incredibly easy for me to get any help I need whether it&#8217;s going in to talk to one of my professors or meeting with my Psych tutor!</li>
<li><strong>Brown De-stressor</strong> Last week, we had a program in the Brown Basement where we got free massages, a chocolate fountain, facemasks, and coloring books while watching “Mean Girls”.<br />

<li><strong>PUPPIES!</strong>From 12-2 last Thursday, the red door turned into a place where students could play with an abundance of dogs. My roommate enjoyed finding a black lab that looked exactly like her dog at home.
<div id="attachment_1616" style="width: 235px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/12/friends-dogs.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1616" class="size-medium wp-image-1616" src="http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/12/friends-dogs-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/12/friends-dogs-225x300.jpg 225w, http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/12/friends-dogs-768x1024.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-1616" class="wp-caption-text">Two of my friends, Avalon and Zoe, de-stressing with the dogs</p></div>

<li><strong>Cookie Decorating and Bubbles</strong><br />
After I was done playing with the dogs, I walked upstairs and got to decorate cookies. There were a bunch of tables with different activities students could take part in, including bracelet making, bubble blowing, and cookie decorating.</li>
<li><strong>My trip to New York!</strong><br />
Last Sunday, I went to New York on the shuttle with some of my friends. It was extremely cool to be able to take an easy two-hour ride to the city for the day. Here&#8217;s a video of us in New York!<br />
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/7yqjiu3s17A?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></li>
<li><strong>Diners, Drive Ins, and Dives</strong> On Friday night, Muhlenberg opened up the dining hall from 10pm to 12pm and served pancakes, sliders, fries, root beer floats, and wings. I’d have to say my favorite was the peanut butter pancake. While we ate, all of the a capella groups performed so we got some nice dining music!</li>
<li><strong>C Level of the Library</strong> Although I normally like to study on level B, I decided that now was the time to try out level C of the library, which is the quietest section. (When you walk into the library, you enter level A. From there, you can go downstairs to level B which is a much quieter level, and then even further down to level C which is the quietest level). Because I tend to get a little distracted while I work, level C was perfect when I had to buckle down and get a great deal of work done.</li>
<li><strong>My Instrumental Station on Pandora</strong> I love listening to music when I study, but I realized that if the music has lyrics, I get a little too involved in my music…so I decided to create an instrumental station. So far so good!</li>
<li><strong>SNOW!</strong><br />
Last Tuesday, I woke up and saw that it was snowing outside! This was my first time seeing snow in my everyday life. Although it’s a tad embarrassing, here is a picture of my after I ran outside my room to sit in the snow.</p>
