								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Although I don&#8217;t leave for Italy until September 1st, there is still so much to do before I leave!! Of course there is packing all of my clothing (which is turning out to be quite hard) but also getting convertor&#8217;s and making sure all my appliances (phone, ipod, camera) are all charged and working; as well as making sure all of my travel info and finances are in place for me to live in Italy for 4 months!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m excited to be spending my fall semester abroad, but also a bit nervous. I&#8217;ve never been so far away from home (CT) for so long, but I know that it will be such a wonderful experience. I also have many Muhlenberg friends traveling with me, which is always comforting! As well as many other friends, Muhlenberg and not, that are traveling to other areas of Europe and I hope to meet up with as many of them as I can!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be visiting school on Sunday August 25th to say &#8220;hi&#8221; to some friends and also to audition for the second semesters mainstage shows at Muhlenberg. There will lots of goodbyes, but luckily only for a semester! I can&#8217;t wait to share my all adventures!</p>
