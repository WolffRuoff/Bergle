								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Now that we&#8217;ve got a foundation through our script, it&#8217;s time to start building from the ground up (aka it&#8217;s time to block the show!)</p>
<p>For the first time, the Sedehi Diversity Project will be performed in the round with a painted floor. We are grateful to the theatre department and to the company of &#8220;TAL: Beyond Imagination&#8221; for letting us use an abbreviated version of the set. The rainbow floor was actually painted by our very own ensemble member, James Briggs! We have a ton more space, a ton more seats, and we have a big responsibility to match the energy and strength of the space. Melina Economos, our director, is working tirelessly to make this piece really move. There must never be a dull moment on stage! So far, we are definitely headed in the right direction. As someone who watches it over and over again every weeknight, I have yet to grow tired of it.</p>
<p>What makes me so excited for this year&#8217;s production is, not only the production value, but the way that urgency for change is portrayed. We&#8217;ve been sitting here for years listening to similar scenarios from different students with a slow shift over all that time, but the volume and pace of this production portray that now is no longer the time to sit on these issues. Now is the time to act. Now is the time to affect change. We really hope the incoming class of 2022 feels that sense of urgency and uses it to help the rest of the student body make a real difference.</p>
<p>A lot of what this show does, from my perspective, is it calls its audiences to action. You&#8217;ll notice that there is already a lot of action taking place as is, but if people don&#8217;t feel like an actual shift is made, then there is probably a whole lot more to be done. A phrase we keep hearing is &#8220;a work in progress&#8221;, which is absolutely true. In order for &#8220;a work in progress&#8221; to become &#8220;a change&#8221; or &#8220;a shift&#8221; is when we all get up and do something. You&#8217;ll notice it when we talk about activism. We&#8217;re asking YOU to take a stand with us, to take action, and to be a part of the work in progress so we can get an actual change by the time the incoming class of 2022 graduates.</p>
<p>Below is our vlog from week 3. It&#8217;s a much lighter side of what happens as we work together to make this happen. Just so you know, we actually do have a lot of fun making this happen for the community.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2">For a lot of our time together I have been glued to my fellow ensemble members, eating dinners together, going shopping together, and its been so wonderful to grown and connect with these beautiful humans (Can you tell I’m the sappy one?) But I am an introvert by trade, and for the last few days I’ve really been enjoying the quiet mornings and afternoons here in my little single, listening to podcasts and painting before rehearsal. And with all of us moving out of the village tomorrow I know the next few days are going to be particularly hectic, so I’ve been relishing this quiet peace for as long as possible.</p>
<p class="p2">But hey we’ve gotten so much done!!!</p>
<p class="p2">We finally had a rough draft for our blocking for the WHOLE script!! Like WHAT! WOW! I am so so SO EXCITED for it to be seen, we’re really creating something beautiful here! Something magical and true.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s my little splash of personality! Good luck to you all!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey there, this is Sophia here, your favorite Puerto Rican cast member.</p>
<p>More than ever this experience has pushed me in ways that I&#8217;ve never been pushed before. Not only am I having to do my own grocery shopping (which is actually so hard, wowza) but this show really pushes us to think hard about the work that we&#8217;re doing, the quotes we choose, and how it can best impact our audience. Our first goal is to speak to the freshman and get the word out about the truths of Muhlenberg, but whats also under the surface of that is how we can best represent Muhlenberg: what messages are we trying to send to not only the freshman in the audience, but the Muhlenberg staff and alumni as well? How can we inspire them to take what they&#8217;ve heard and weave it into the lives they&#8217;ll live on this campus?</p>
<p>The answer of this question should come from an audience member, sure I could answer this for someone, but if I really want to do the work correctly, then the answer should not be handed to them on a silver platter.</p>
<p>I am thrilled and honored to do this work, show week is right around the corner and while we may not be completely ready for the freshman, we&#8217;re definitely only getting more and more excited to meet them.</p>
<p>Cya soon,</p>
<p>Sophia</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>These past few weeks have consisted of rehearsals 6 days a week that go until almost midnight, going back to our suites and staying up until later, and waking up way into the afternoon. The first week or so was focused on doing last minute interviews and finishing up transcriptions so we could start to build our script. We then had to shorten said script by more than half in order to have a 35 minute show (the phrase “kill your darlings” was used a lot). Around the second week, Troy invited us over to his house for dinner and swimming, which was honestly the highlight or my SDP experience.</p>
<p>When we’re not working on SDP, most of us can usually be found relaxing with a Netflix show or eating &#8211; I found that the amount of cheese I can eat on my own is terrifying. Some of us also went to the farmers market, walked in parks, thrift shopping, and last night we dyed my hair purple (and attempted to dye Jordan’s beard). But now it’s time to get our lines and blocking memorized as well as start thinking about what we’ll be wearing for the show, so stay tuned!!</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am so lucky and excited to be able to say that because this project means so much to me. After being a part of the project last year in the ensemble, I knew I needed to be involved in any way I could this year. I am so thankful to be able to be a part of the project again this year as the student director. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But enough about me. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the great joys of working on SDP is the chance to work with some amazing humans. And let me tell you, I am already soooo proud of them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the next week, get ready to hear from each of our ensemble members. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, don&#8217;t forget to check back in with this blog, the vlog, and the Instagram to hear more from me and the ensemble!  </span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello and welcome to the Sedehi Diversity Project for 2018! I am Armida Flores, the Production Manager for this year&#8217;s project. Basically, one of my many duties is to keep you all updated with our process of creating this incredible production. We&#8217;ve got 5 weeks to create something from nothing and present it to the incoming freshmen, the community, and, this year, our alumni as well!</p>
<p>We&#8217;re so incredibly excited to announce that there will be an alumni event happening this year for all of the past ensemble members of the Sedehi Diversity Project. Most alumni events at the college tend to attract about 15 alumni, but this year, we have about 50 alumni who are registered to attend! To that, I&#8217;d like to give a special shoutout and thanks to those alumni who will be attending for your passion and support for this project. We really wouldn&#8217;t be where we are without you. We are so excited to meet all of you and to discuss how far Muhlenberg has come over the last 13 years since the project began.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s all happening on August 25th. We&#8217;ve got a little bit of time until then.</p>
<p><strong>WEEK 1: July 22nd-28th</strong></p>
<p>Moving in and finally getting to see each other after so many poor-connection video chats was so refreshing and exciting. My personal feeling moving into our village suites was that this was finally gonna get moving. We had over 50 interviews transcribed and more on the way as well, so it felt like &#8220;we&#8217;re here and this is really happening and we have more than just an idea with what we&#8217;d like to perform&#8221;. We had Friday and Saturday to relax and get settled in for a bit, having movie nights and finishing up interview transcriptions.</p>
<p>Our very first rehearsal consisted of the one thing we have been prepping for since our first meeting&#8230; our own interviews. It was a fantastic way to finish off student interviews; getting to sit down in small groups of three and really listen to each other and appreciate each other&#8217;s experiences on campus.</p>
<p>We were faced with a disastrous week of rain as we began to sit and go over 50 transcriptions together, reading and picking out lines we&#8217;d like to use in our piece. We began at 6pm and would go (sometimes) to midnight, getting ten to eleven transcriptions done each night. It would have been completely torturous, until Interfaith showed up.</p>
<p>Interfaith and our ensemble ran into a bit of a dilemma when we were both under the impression that we were using the same space. Interfaith graciously agreed to host their social in the basement, which we are forever grateful for. They practically saved the rest of our week when they came upstairs and offered us the leftovers of their desserts. There was a beautiful vanilla mousse cake and a box of truffles. I think this really speaks to the impact that the Sedehi Diversity Project has on the Muhlenberg community and what it means to us. It feels so good to know that people are responding and really hold this project close to their hearts. Thank you so much, Interfaith, not only for the free desserts, but for giving us so much encouragement that what we&#8217;re doing matters to people.</p>
<p><strong>WEEK 2: July 29th-August 4th </strong></p>
<p>As if this couldn&#8217;t get any more real, at the start of the second week, we had more than enough material to make a solid script. We organized them into different categories like &#8220;Diversity at Muhlenberg&#8221;, money, safety, allyship and activism, race, religion, and probably a dozen more. It was a little overwhelming at first, printing out all the material and physically seeing it in front of. We had A LOT of editing and organizing to do in order to make something truly special. So we started the &#8220;puzzle method&#8221; and cut out each line, laid them all down on the floor, and put them in conversation with each other to create our script, like putting together pieces of a puzzle. It is no easy take and it does not take one 4 hour rehearsal to get it all done, especially when it came to categories like allyship, race, and safety. The silver lining in this is that the people we interviewed are absolutely brilliant and have a lot of valid, important opinions. The fact that we have a hard time creating a 35 minute show from all of the material we have actually means that there are some really wonderful people on this campus.</p>
<p>Special shout out to Jon Diaz, who gave us ice cream from the Multi freezer on night one. We love you!</p>
<p>Another one of the things that makes this year&#8217;s project unlike any before is that we now officially have an Instagram account! If you have  Instagram, give us a follow @SedehiDiversityProject2018 for daily updates on our feed and on our story! It&#8217;s one of the easiest ways to keep track with our process.</p>
<p>Now, without further ado, here is our very first vlog video capturing Weeks 1 and 2!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>Bet you thought I forgot about you all! I promise this has been the first second I have had free since classes began at the end of August, but now I&#8217;ve got a domino&#8217;s pizza (chicken, bacon, and ranch if anyone was curious), a warm blanket, and some Spotify to help me reminisce about the good old days (&#8230;.last month) when we closed SDP.</p>
<p><a href="http://sedehidiversityproject.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2017/09/047.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-419 " src="http://sedehidiversityproject.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2017/09/047-e1505698798479-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="427" height="320" srcset="http://sedehidiversityproject.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2017/09/047-e1505698798479-300x225.jpg 300w, http://sedehidiversityproject.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2017/09/047-e1505698798479-768x576.jpg 768w, http://sedehidiversityproject.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2017/09/047-e1505698798479-1024x768.jpg 1024w, http://sedehidiversityproject.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2017/09/047-e1505698798479-624x468.jpg 624w" sizes="(max-width: 427px) 100vw, 427px" /></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;m not going to give you an in depth summary of the last week of the process mainly because I don&#8217;t remember every single thing that happened this late in the game; that entire week was one huge blur. It seemed like we ate, slept, and breathed SDP even more than usual, finalizing the technical aspects of the show and still making additional edits to the script throughout the week leading up to the weekend shows. Our first performance was for the post-show discussion facilitators on Tuesday and they absolutely loved it! We got some great feedback from this audience which was extremely helpful when going into the athletes&#8217; shows on Wednesday. We then had Thursday and Friday to work out additional kinks and soon enough it was already Saturday! Saturday and Sunday went by just as fast as everyone warned it would. Even though we did 3 shows each day, it still seemed like I blinked up in the tech booth and suddenly everyone was gone and we had one performance left: the Sunday night community show.</p>
<p>Now, I was told by multiple people involved in last year&#8217;s production that the Sunday evening community show is a complete game changer, and that it&#8217;s one of the best parts of being in SDP. This performance is open to the public, but is typically filled with current Muhlenberg students or recent alumni. Therefore, this show is usually the one filled with the most loving, supportive, and responsive audience out of all of them, almost overwhelmingly so. In fact, when I arrived at the theater that night at the ensemble call time, the box office lobby was already filled to the brim with excited audience members waiting to be let in. Thankfully, I had the help of my trusty number one, Bree Booth, some of my other friends, and my boyfriend to worry about crowd control, seat availability, ticket distribution, and other stress-inducing tasks so I could focus on making sure everyone was entering the space safely and felt happy and excited for the show among all the chaos. After what seemed like forever, everyone finally had a seat, there was a contagiously exciting buzz louder than the music, and we were able to start the show.</p>
<p>Bree walked out for her pre-show speech to deafening screams of encouragement from the audience which caused both her and I to get emotional. But this was just the beginning.</p>
<p>The ensemble really brought their all for this last show. I could see (even from all the way up in my light booth seat!) that they were truly relishing in it, enjoying every line, every moment, and every audience reaction, as this was the last time they would ever get to share these stories and touch these people through this show. It was one of the most special experiences I could ever have imagined having sitting and watching these wonderful people say these words for the last time.</p>
<p><a href="http://sedehidiversityproject.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2017/09/002.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-421 " src="http://sedehidiversityproject.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2017/09/002-e1505698879419-300x169.jpg" alt="" width="412" height="232" srcset="http://sedehidiversityproject.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2017/09/002-e1505698879419-300x169.jpg 300w, http://sedehidiversityproject.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2017/09/002-e1505698879419-1024x577.jpg 1024w, http://sedehidiversityproject.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2017/09/002-e1505698879419-624x352.jpg 624w, http://sedehidiversityproject.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2017/09/002-e1505698879419-768x433.jpg 768w, http://sedehidiversityproject.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2017/09/002-e1505698879419.jpg 1136w" sizes="(max-width: 412px) 100vw, 412px" /></a></p>
<p>Once we reached the part at the end of the show where the ensemble relays advice to the freshmen audience members, I fully lost it. I began quietly sobbing up on the catwalk out of overwhelming pride for the magic we created together. I was sad that it was ending right before my eyes, of course, but I was also so happy for the ensemble members who worked so hard and did so well.  I was grateful for this opportunity, for these people, for this knowledge I was walking away with. I was filled with so, so much love. The show came to an end and when I hit the last light cue, the audience once again erupted. The ensemble received a well-deserved standing ovation, and made me cry even harder when they gestured up to me during their final bows. I will never, ever experience something like this in my life again, and I can&#8217;t thank those other 8 project creators enough.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to forget about all the work that went into this project in the following weeks, because the morning after our final show was the day that classes began. And as we all know, once classes begin the year seems to go by in an instant. We&#8217;re all suddenly sitting in our seats on the lawn for graduation accepting our diplomas or cheering on our friends and questioning how we got here so fast. But something I&#8217;ve been trying to remind myself over these past couple weeks is that SDP 2017 is something that DID happen. It was real, however magical and fictional it may actually have felt like. It didn&#8217;t fix the world by any means, but it did change it. It began conversations, explanations, friendships, communities, understanding, acceptance. It gave a voice to so many unheard members of our Muhlenberg family. It gave ME a new family to call my own, and all of those things deserve to be remembered and cherished for years to come.</p>

<p>This is the last blog post I&#8217;ll be writing as the Sedehi Diversity Project manager, so to my readers, I say thank you! Thanks for coming on this journey with us and supporting us along the way. To Troy, I say thank you. You are one of the most brilliant, magnificent people I have ever had the pleasure of working with and I hope to do so again in the near future. And finally, to my SDP family I say, thank you. You will never know how much you did for me over this summer. You have my whole heart. Thank you, thank you, thank you.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s it, folks! I wish next year&#8217;s ensemble the BEST of luck. You are going to have the time of your lives through all the hard work, I promise. Document every moment whether that be pictures, videos, blog posts, or snapshots in your memory because you&#8217;re not going to want to miss a thing. All my love to you, future creators. I&#8217;m already jealous.</p>
<p>I leave you with the little footage I managed to take during the last week of the process. I was really trying to take it all in once I realized it was slowly slipping away, so I didn&#8217;t pick up my camera as much as I wanted to. Still some fun memories captured though, so make sure to check it out.</p>
<p>Thanks again to everyone. Here&#8217;s to &#8220;A Seat At the Table.&#8221;</p>
<p>xo</p>
<p>~Mikaela</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was originally cast in the Sedehi Diversity Project as an alternate, but on July 19th, two days before the cast was set to move in, I was asked to join the ensemble. I spent the summer mostly just trying to get my dog to give me the time of day, but two days later I was back in Allentown to take part in the project!</p>
<p>It was a little scary to leave so abruptly and be among a bunch of mostly upperclassmen who I had never met. They were all very welcoming and caught me up on all the preparations they did during the year. In transcribing the interviews and compiling the script, I learned a lot from other members of the community’s perspectives. I enjoyed including my own perspective as the only wheelchair using students on campus, too.</p>
<p>I think the project is important because it gives the incoming freshmen a raw and realistic glimpse into our community. It tells the truth: it’s not perfect, it’s not built for everyone, but there is unity and hope for the future. I was very impressed and moved by it when I saw it my freshman year, almost one year ago. Some people might take the wrong message from the project. They might interpret it as a warning filled with horror stories and regret their decision in coming to Muhlenberg. The point of the project is to inspire the new generation in the community to be the change they want to see in Muhlenberg and in the world. I’m very lucky to be part of such an important piece, and look forward to sharing it with the community!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello, all!</p>
<p>I write this to you having just completed a long, tiresome, stressful day of tech rehearsals, cue to cues, and show runs. But, even though I&#8217;m exhausted, anxious for the shows to come this week, and sad that it will soon all be over, I am also exhilarated by the incredible progress we made today, proud of all of us for the hard work we&#8217;ve been putting into this project we love so much, and excited to share it with some fresh eyes and ears at tomorrow&#8217;s open dress rehearsal.</p>
<p>We are approaching week 5 which is going to be many more tech rehearsals and then performances for the post-show facilitators, campus safety, ORS, RAs and SAs, student athletes, the administration, family and friends, and most importantly, the class of 2021. While there is so much in store, we also had a jam packed week 4, which started with a lovely evening out at the home of none other than our faculty adviser, Troy.</p>
<p>To release the stress of week 3 and revitalize for week 4, Troy invited us to his home to have dinner (which was absolutely phenomenal, if anyone was wondering), talk with some other faculty members, go swimming in his backyard pool, and share in each other&#8217;s company. We had the best time! Highlights include water gun fights and whirlpools while swimming, cookie cake made by Troy&#8217;s husband, raspberries with Wonder Woman themed toothpicks for easy snacking, spotting a skunk in the backyard, and laughing for hours on end. We love ya, Troy! Thank you so much for having us.</p>

<p>The week to follow was a lot and I mean a LOT of blocking. The thing I&#8217;m learning about SDP is that when you think you have a final script, you don&#8217;t (we&#8217;re still making script edits the week of performances). When you think you have the entire show blocked, you don&#8217;t. When you think you&#8217;ve solved all the problems, you absolutely have not. Moral of the story: SDP never sleeps, is never finished, and will, honestly, never be perfect. But we sure are trying our best to effectively share these stories with the world and I can whole hardheartedly say that I am so proud of the production we&#8217;ve created.</p>

<p>Troy helped us a lot this week by attending rehearsals and giving his feedback, helping us cut down the script, and giving us encouragement and inspiration. By the end of the week, we had finally reached a 19 page script that ran 34 minutes long and we were over the moon! This was one of the best moments of the week, tacked onto the list of other great moments such as the cast bonding night we had on Tuesday, yet another late night trip to Applebee&#8217;s, getting to move into our permanent fall housing (through much blood, sweat, and tears&#8230;.literally), and many intense games of zip zap zop. I find more things to love about these people every single day, and I am constantly grateful for this project for bringing us together.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s actually happening!! We technically open tomorrow with our open dress and then by Wednesday, we&#8217;re in business! I can&#8217;t believe we&#8217;re already here (but more importantly, I can&#8217;t believe classes and AUDITIONS start in a week!!!! But that&#8217;s for another time&#8230;). Make sure to check out our week 4 vlog below, read the ensemble members&#8217; reflective blog posts, and come back next week to see how our final week on the project went. That&#8217;s all for now, thanks for reading and I&#8217;ll see you soon! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The past three weeks with my fellow SDP cast members have been so fun and full of adventure! I celebrated my birthday with these wonderful people and they got me an ice cream cake (my absolute favorite). I’m so happy that I’m able to have fun with these people but also learn and work with them as well. Each day is a new experience and a new opportunity to earn something because everyone is involved in such different things which allows different perspectives to come together. I’ve had so much fun in the village laughing and eating hummus with friends, but I’ve also had conversations with them about everything from the problematic occurrences on RuPaul’s Drag Race to the decision to add shades of brown to the pride flag in Philly. It’s been really cool to have the chance to gain knowledge about different things not just during the hours of rehearsal, but outside of that as well.</p>
