								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tonight is the night! We will be seeing Spectrum Dance at Zoellner Arts Center! Many classes are required to attend, so we look forward to seeing many of you there!</p>
<div><b>Check in will begin at 6:00pm in the CA.</b> There will be point people holding clip boards with names divided alphabetically. Find the point person with the section of the alphabet that contains your name to check-in.<u> It is imperative that you keep the noise down </u> in the CA so that you can clearly hear directions about who to go to, and when to board the bus. <b>The bus leaves promptly at 6:30 pm</b>. <b>We will not wait for you!</b></div>
<div><b> </b></div>
<div>Note that we will be staying for a talk back after the performance. We are very excited that one of our very own faculty members will be moderating the talk back. It might be beneficial to do a little research before the show, so you can ask questions and listen to the Q&amp;A session with a little contextualization. This piece has some exciting elements that went into its creation!</div>
<div></div>
<div>Can&#8217;t wait to see you all there!</div>
<div></div>
<div>For more information on the artists and show check out Zoellner&#8217;s website <a href="http://zoellner.cas2.lehigh.edu/content/spectrum-dance-theater-rap-race">here.</a> It looks like an incredible show!</div>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Below is IMPORTANT information regarding some changes/updates that have been made to the choreography proposal process for the fall concerts so PLEASE READ…</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">As our program is constantly evolving to support students’ growth and creativity, so do the models in which we create! There are several updates to the choreography proposal process that affect ALL those wishing to choreograph this semester.  First and foremost, all choreographers interested in proposing for Dance Gallery and/or Moving Stories will be required to create 30 seconds of material. Video record the phrasework three times, with three different selections of music/sound, and then upload the three recordings to a shared google drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Secondly, choreographers will sign up for a half hour time slot on MONDAY 8/27, rather than individual time slots. In an effort to be more transparent, presenting in small groups will allow students to learn from and support each other in the proposal process. Choreographers will have five minutes each to present their filmed choreographic study, and discuss their proposal in front of the faculty artistic directors and peers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Lastly, it is important to remind everyone that the number of students eligible to choreograph this semester exceeds the total number of spots available. Students meeting eligibility requirements for a particular concert are not guaranteed to present work on their preferred concert, especially given the number of people who are required to choreograph for Advanced Composition. Assignments of choreographers to each concert is at the discretion of the faculty artistic directors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">We’re excited for the changes to proposal process for Gallery and Moving Stories. We encourage everyone eligible to choreograph this semester to begin working on their proposals. Final decisions on the works selected for the concerts will be made at the end of the first week of classes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">If you have any questions, please contact Megan Flynn: <a>meganflynn@muhlenberg.edu</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Happy Choreographing!</p>

<div></div>
<div>About the artists:</div>
<div></div>
<div>Contemporary Partnering 2 Shaina Branfman &amp; Bryan Strimpel / BS Movement In this partnering workshop we will study the responsibility two individuals must take on when working together to create one cohesive experience. We will focus on momentum, efficiency, and awareness as individuals, as well as for the larger whole of the partnered relationship. When we take on another person’s weight we are caring for both their physicality, as well as the less tangible emotional weight that comes with being alive. It is this level of attention for how we give, and how we receive weight which we will exercise in order to fully realize the complexities of moving in relationship to another moving body.</div>
<div></div>
<div>BS Movement is the collected, and ongoing research of collaborative/creative duo, Shaina Branfman and Bryan Strimpel. Through teaching, performing and lifestyle, the two probe continually into their philosophy: No matter our differences we all move, so we are all the same. Shaina completed her certification as a Movement Analyst at the Laban Institute of Movement Studies in New York City and completed studies in religion and philosophy at the New York All Faiths Seminary International where she was ordained as an Interfaith Minister. She is currently a member of The Feath3r Theory, and works at RDAPDan &#8211; a non-profit federal prison consultant company. Bryan is a graduate of Wayne State University with a B.F.A in dance. He has danced with Nicholas Leichter Dance, Brian Brooks Moving Company, David Dorfman Dance, ThirdRailProjects and is currently a member of The Feath3r Theory. Bryan was an Adjunct Professor of Dance at LIU Brooklyn and he teaches regularly at Peridance in NYC. Bryan is honored to have been selected as one of Dance Magazine&#8217;s &#8216;Top 25 to Watch&#8217; for 2013.</div>

<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><em>Fee: $850</em></strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In this 30 hour course, students and clinicians will focus on tension flow attributes (affect), pre-efforts (defenses and learning style), efforts (coping style and ego strength), shaping in directions (structure for defenses, boundaries, and learning), and shaping in planes (structure for complex relationships). Movement observation, labeling, notation, and diagram construction will be taught and practiced. Clinical understanding of these patterns will be deepened and further applications to clinical work will be explored. Construction of the TFA, PE, E, SD, and SP diagrams of the profile as well as an analysis of the findings will be required (for alternate route students and those pursuing KMP certification).</p>

Clinical applications will be integrated into the course.</p>
