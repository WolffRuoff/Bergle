								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today&#8217;s post is by guest Leslie Hickman, a student in Muhlenberg College&#8217;s Archaeology in Maine field school.</p>
<p>The Harriman’s were one clean family. At least, that’s what we joked to one another as day after day of digging turned up no artifacts. This time period, 1760-1820, was supposed to be one where families disposed of their garbage in the most convenient place- their front lawn, but at the promising Western Foundation only some glass was found. This seemed most unusual considering that anything made or used by humans and left behind can be classified as an artifact, from a ceremonial mask to a broken nail, but there was almost nothing. However, even the lack of artifacts provided information- most likely, no one had actually lived there. Fortunately, the Eastern Foundation yielded more results. When the first piece of brick as large as my fingernail was found we all could’ve danced a jig. More brick, some shell, nail, pieces of kaolin pipe, and pieces of ceramic were found. We even found a button made out of a copper alloy. However, the biggest and most telling find was a mound of rocks with evidence of tar. Bits of centuries-old rope preserved in resin were found, and we classified a set of rope strands that were clumped together with tar as our first feature. The feature suggests this foundation might’ve been a processing plant for coating ship material in tar in order to protect it from water. Though fascinating, the foundation wasn’t what we were originally looking for, which was a house. The minimal amount of artifacts disqualifies these two foundations as homes, which leads us to wonder where exactly the Harriman’s lived. But for now, we’re learning all we can from our few recovered artifacts, slowly piecing together the puzzle.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The following is a guest post by Liuba Seaboyer, a student in Muhlenberg College&#8217;s Archaeological Field School in Maine.</p>
<p>Features are manmade structures that cannot be easily removed from archaeological excavations. Features can range from foundations and stone walls to pits and postholes. At the Harriman Point site, we were originally looking for a foundation at the western site where there were stones thought to be a fallen chimney. We were unable to find the foundation and now believe that the mound was deliberately made at first as a foundation, but then as a way to clear extra rocks from around the property. This interpretation is apparent based on the two parallel stone walls that have been laid north of the mound. The walls are made of large boulders that would have been brought to the site by oxen pulled sleds and then pushed off into their current locations.</p>
<p>To the east of all sites, there is a stone wall that stretches across a long area facing the ocean and it is still classified as a feature even though we did not uncover it. Why the wall was actually created is unknown; however, the wall might have been created by Peter Harriman Sr. before he left to serve in the Revolutionary War as a way to protect his house on the coast from the British.</p>
<p>At the eastern site, where we are now excavating, there is a mound of rock next to a depression. We were looking to find stone walls or part of the foundation of a house. Today, while excavating, our first feature was found and it was not what we were expecting. The feature is a mass of tar that included resin covered fishing nets, rope, and twine which would have been used to waterproof these items. Although this was not the feature we were looking for, it shows that the space was occupied and used by someone living nearby. Since we have not found a foundation yet, it will be interesting to keep excavating in the hopes of finding where Peter Harriman lived in proximity to the tar pit feature.</p>

<p>Context? What is context? Context is one of the most important concepts and ideas in archaeology. To an archaeologist, context is everything. There are two types of context, historical context and archaeological context.</p>
<p>Historical context is many things that all aid in the larger understanding of the process of history. Context is everything that influences a specific time period and a specific place. Context changes everywhere and it changes throughout time because the world is not static, but always moving and changing. The context with the Harriman Point Site has to do with the struggles associated with the Revolutionary War and the social and trade networks of that time period and particular place.</p>
<p>Archaeological context (i.e. strata, association, artifacts, ecofacts, soil, and features) are what archaeologists focus on when they excavate. It is what is not there just as much as what is there. With the main Western Foundation, whilst we were excavating that area, we encountered no artifacts of any kind- no nails, no ceramics, no brick, no specials- to the structure in context of that area, meaning that because there were no artifacts found, then the house must have been abandoned during mid construction, unlike the second, Eastern Foundation, were we are finding some artifacts which indicate people lived there contrary to the Eastern Site.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The following is a guest post by Weston Conner, a student of Muhlenberg College&#8217;s Archaeological Field School in Maine.</p>
<p>At its heart, archaeology is a practice concerned primarily with people. Who they were, how they lived, what they did with their time here on Earth—all this lies under the edge of an archaeologist’s trowel. Although also concerned with the past, the study of history is a much different practice. Historians concern themselves primarily with historical document, focusing on the written word. Archaeologists deal with physical remains that have been left behind—artifacts like pieces of pottery or other objects affected by humans. The information that can be gathered from these two sources is quite different; the archaeologist and the historian will not necessarily gather the same information. The historian may triumph in his or her knowledge of the major events and socioeconomic conditions of the time—the major events that would be likely to be recorded, but the archaeologist will see the details that history has passed over. Through the study of the remnants left behind by those who came before, information on people’s diet, culture, and way of life can be gleaned that would otherwise have been lost. It is people and their lives that reign supreme to the archaeologist, not the overarching sweeps of time.</p>
<p>At Harriman Point in Brooklin, Maine, archaeology is poised to function as a more effective tool than the study of history could. Historical documents provide some information, but the records from the time period involved—the end of the 18<sup>th</sup> century and the beginning of the 19<sup>th</sup> century—are neither clear nor complete. The combination of the government being located in Massachusetts and the more general confusion of the time from wars and conflicting documents makes it difficult for history to shed a great deal of light on the lives of those living in the area at the time. Archaeology will allow us to learn from the physical remains of the period itself. The artifacts that are found and the larger features left behind on the landscape can add information about how these people lived. Specific information about what people used in their homes, what affected their day to day lives, and how they lived on a more specific level will hopefully be found and help to fill in the historical account of the time period. Archaeology promises to dig up information that would otherwise have remained buried, tucked away in a hill in Downeast Maine.</p>

<p>A typical day in the field might seem mundane and repetitive… grid, level, dig, grid, level, dig… but there are often many unexpected surprises that require archeologists to be resourceful. Problems can arise anywhere from a sudden rain shower to getting lost on a bathroom trek in the woods. During our dig in Surry, Maine, the group encountered several obstacles that required us to think on our feet. One of the most helpful things to know is the lay of the land. Always know where the site is located, and what land features are around it.<ins cite="mailto:Brittany%20Kosiak" datetime="2011-08-09T20:51"> N</ins>atural features in a landscape can help in numerous ways <ins cite="mailto:Brittany%20Kosiak" datetime="2011-08-09T20:51">and </ins>not only if you get lost. Knowing where freshwater and food sources (in case someone is hungry of course!) are can always aid in tough situations. Also, always be prepared for bad weather, it can wreak havoc on your mood and your excavation.</p>
<p>On August 8, 2011, we arrived on site bright and early to find everything soaked from<ins cite="mailto:Brittany%20Kosiak" datetime="2011-08-09T20:52"> rain that leaked through</ins> holes in <ins cite="mailto:Brittany%20Kosiak" datetime="2011-08-09T20:52">the </ins>tarps <ins cite="mailto:Brittany%20Kosiak" datetime="2011-08-09T20:52">covering </ins>our units<ins cite="mailto:Brittany%20Kosiak" datetime="2011-08-09T21:03">.</ins> Dr. Carter <ins cite="mailto:Brittany%20Kosiak" datetime="2011-08-09T20:52">had</ins> me open a new unit that day and it was a muddy, slippery, clay 1-meter square. I was happily playing in the mud until I filled my bucket… and it became time to sift. Everyone knows that sifting is attempting to get giant wads of clay-dirt through tiny ¼ inch <ins cite="mailto:Brittany%20Kosiak" datetime="2011-08-09T20:53">openings</ins>, and <ins cite="mailto:Brittany%20Kosiak" datetime="2011-08-09T20:53">that day </ins>it seemed impossible. It was taking everyone forever to sift, and we were not seeing all the artifacts. We needed an easy solution!  Since we know the landscape well, everyone knew about the fresh water stream that ran to the ocean located only <ins cite="mailto:Brittany%20Kosiak" datetime="2011-08-09T20:54">thirty</ins> feet from our site. Using this water source, we sifted our buckets of dirt through the ¼ inch sifter with the aid of running water<ins cite="mailto:Brittany%20Kosiak" datetime="2011-08-09T20:55">.</ins> <ins cite="mailto:Brittany%20Kosiak" datetime="2011-08-09T20:55">I</ins>t felt like we were panning for gold<ins cite="mailto:Brittany%20Kosiak" datetime="2011-08-09T20:54"> and that </ins>was a lot of fun. This solution made it easier to spot artifacts hidden in clay wads, and saved us time cleaning <ins cite="mailto:Brittany%20Kosiak" datetime="2011-08-09T20:56">tons</ins> of brick. However, with every solution to a problem, it is always important to be aware of the consequences that follow it. When sifting, we normally sift the dirt through a ¼ inch screen and then through a 1/8-inch screen. This prevents the loss of any smaller artifacts that slip through the first screen. <ins cite="mailto:Brittany%20Kosiak" datetime="2011-08-09T20:57">In doing this, we had to recognize</ins> that when sifting the objects through only the ¼ inch screen, we could potentially be losing smaller artifacts. Also, when we put artifacts of certain materials like metal or bone through water <ins cite="mailto:Brittany%20Kosiak" datetime="2011-08-09T20:58">they may</ins> be damaged. It is important to weigh the pros and cons <ins cite="mailto:Brittany%20Kosiak" datetime="2011-08-09T20:59">of </ins>any new method before it is used <ins cite="mailto:Brittany%20Kosiak" datetime="2011-08-09T20:59">in</ins> the field<ins cite="mailto:Brittany%20Kosiak" datetime="2011-08-09T20:59">.</ins><ins cite="mailto:Brittany%20Kosiak" datetime="2011-08-09T21:00"> A</ins>nd when a new method is used make sure it is noted in that day’s field log! This quick-thinking method saved us a lot of time, energy, and artifacts that day. Thinking on your feet is an extremely important skill that can save time, the excavation, and everyone’s sanity!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Guest Post by Hannah Watson, student in Muhlenberg College&#8217;s Archaeology in Maine</p>
<p>Thousands of bricks and hundreds of pieces of ceramic, glass, bone and metal have been carefully sorted, cleaned and labeled.  In our three weeks we have dug our way through level after level, getting covered in mud and dirt.  We strained to carry the heavy buckets of mud over to the sifters, giving our wrists blisters, to make sure no artifacts were overlooked.  Each type of artifact received its own bag (or seven in the case of brick) and each bag was carefully labeled to distinguish from which unit it came.  The artifacts were then carefully transported back to our lab where each individual piece was given a meticulous washing.  The artifacts were then placed in clean bags and our counting skills were challenged.  To make sure no one else had to do this mundane counting, we used our beard scissors to cut out the smallest labels possible, so even the tiniest pieces of ceramic and glass had labels attentively pasted on them.  With boxes after boxes of these artifacts lined up and the digging over, the question is- what to do with all of them?</p>
<p>As with all archaeological digs, everything found belongs to the owner of the land on which the site resides.  He has graciously allowed us to take the artifacts back to Muhlenberg for further analysis- a vital aspect to any excavation. Further investigation of the artifacts will allow us to draw better conclusions about the site and answer greater questions. Due to the large amount of bricks found, it wouldn’t be reasonable to cart seventeen boxes the ten hours to Muhlenberg.  Instead they will be weighed, counted, and recorded here and stored in an unused, but safe local place.  The glass, ceramic, metal and bone all fit into much more manageable, smaller boxes that will fit into the car to make the trek back to Allentown.  Dr. Carter and his students will continue to research and examine the artifacts for information such as which parts of the house were used for preparing or eating the food.  Last year a class was offered at ‘Berg in which the artifacts found in the 2008 excavation were analyzed.  Perhaps another will be offered in the future.  There is also talk of a senior project for Megan of assembling some of the pulverized bowls back together.  Dr Carter hopes to return every two years to continue to dig and gather further information on this site, but once the project has been as completed, the artifacts will not need to sit in the college basement anymore.  They will naturally be re-offered to the landowner and perhaps he will donate them to a local organization for other people to enjoy or scrutinize.  These artifacts have been through a lot the past few days, but their life out of the mud is far from over.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Guest post by Krista Gabarro, Student in Muhlenberg College&#8217;s Archaeology in Maine.</p>
<p>At 7am, the Willard Kane house in Surry Maine begins to stir.  Some of its inhabitants have been awake for a while. Others are just now silencing alarm clocks and preparing for the day ahead.  Students and director of Muhlenberg College’s Archaeology in Maine dress in clothes that can withstand a bit of dirt and head to the breakfast table to fuel our bodies for the morning’s work.  Cereal, bagels, toast, yogurt and homemade granola grace the table and disappear rapidly. We all know that the three and a half hours until lunch will seem endless if we are hungry.  Although we are not all morning people, smiles appear and kind words are exchanged.  We make simple sandwiches of peanut butter and jelly or cold cuts and pack them in the cooler. .  After a week of PB&amp;J, the majority of the class has chosen to spice up their lunches with ham or turkey, lettuce and cheese.  At 7:35, the two students in charge of equipment begin loading the vehicle.  Despite a Chevy Tahoe being able to hold a large family, it is not quite roomy enough for eight people and archaeological equipment.  The students in the third row seat clamber in and hold tight to their backpacks while those in the second row seat generally cannot put their feet on the floor because of the cooler and water jug.</p>
<p>Once we arrive at the site -thankfully, only 5 minutes down the road- we unload the Tahoe.  The air is scented with bug spray and trowels clank together.  Dr. Carter explains any changes in activity from the previous day, such as new units to be dug or just how deep to dig a unit.  The students grab 5 gallon buckets, saw horses and sifting screens.  Had rain been forecasted, we must remove the make-shift tents and lay them out to dry.  We each head to our area toting trowels, gloves, whiskbrooms and clipboards and settle in.  The water level beeps incessantly as initial height  measurements are called out.  Trowels gently scrape the dirt and scoops rhythmically fill and are emptied into the buckets.  The site is not always so calm; after rain certain areas of the site become quite slippery and students have fallen, both gracefully AND gracelessly.  Frequently, the air is punctuated by an excited exclamation that an artifact has been found!  A tag is readied and placed in a bag identifying it as brick, ceramic, bone, glass, metal, shell or an unidentified material, along with the other pertinent information such as the Unit, Level, Muhlenberg College, excavators’ names and the date.  The bags of brick tend to fill quickly and certain artifacts elicit more excitement than others.  A tooth, for example, may just cause someone to run (carefully, of course) across the site to Dr. Carter for a definitive identification!</p>
<p>We gratefully break for lunch around 11:30 once each group has reached a good stopping point.  Right down the gravel drive is the ocean where we sit and eat our sandwiches, fruit and cookies.  We dine under the sun as loons fish in the ocean.  Dr. Carter tries to outdo himself with his rock skipping talents as some of the students collect special rocks and shells.  Dr. Carter becomes so intent on besting himself, that he may disregard his personal well-being, nearly breaking his toe on a pesky rock!  We return to the site at noon and continue to excavate until 3:45pm.  At this time, we begin to finish up for the day.  Equipment is repacked, Units are swept up and covered with plastic tents and we all pile into the car.</p>
<p>We drive back to the house, unload the car and begin to wash our artifacts.  Brick, ceramic and glass are washed in tubs outside with water and paintbrushes.  They are then laid on screens and placed in the barn to dry overnight.  The artifacts from the previous day that are drying on the screen are packed away with their identification tags.  The two students in charge of dinner for the week begin cooking, and have the meal ready around 5:30pm.  The meals are delicious and balanced and everyone leaves the table stuffed.</p>
<p>The students and Dr. Carter then prepare for lecture by rereading the assigned article or chapter in the textbook.  .  We sit at the kitchen table for class, which begins at 7pm and generally lasts until about 8:15pm.  Most of the students shower and head to bed by 10pm.  Although each day is exhausting, the Willard Kane house begins to stir around 7am, and we are ready for another exciting day in the field!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Guest Blog by Alex Shaen, Student at Muhlenberg College&#8217;s Archaeology in Maine</p>
<p>In a little over one week in the field at the Joy/Flood site, we have uncovered a vast assortment of artifacts ranging from bricks to animal bones.  We have worked eight and a half days in the field and have uncovered boxes worth of metal, glass, ceramics, brick, bone, and shell. These items are from all around the foundation at the site.  We chose several units to begin with: two in the middle of the foundation, one outside the foundation to the east, one outside the foundation to the west, and several more on the foundation walls.  Each of these 1m by 1m areas yielded many different artifacts.</p>
<p>The unit to the west consisted largely of bricks, as well as a few pieces of ceramics, glass and bone.  The major find in this unit was a piece of perforated ceramic, perhaps a colander.  A previously excavated unit in the same vicinity also largely consisted of bricks.  All of these bricks in this area possibly indicate the direction in which the chimney  collapsed.  The other artifacts found in this area suggest a sheet midden, which is a thin layer of trash people of the 18th century threw outside of the house.</p>
<p>The unit outside of the foundation to the east resulted in very few finds, but did tell a story.  After digging down nearly 40 cm, the unit produced only a few pieces of ceramics, glass and brick.  Although little was found, the soil changed color as they dug deeper and were able to deduce that their had once been a fire in the area resulting from burning trees down to make room for the foundation.</p>
<p>The unit inside the foundation, was much different than the other two units and produced a wider assortment of artifacts, with the exception of brick.  One of the main reasons behind this dense concentration of artifacts was the fact that the house collapsed inward and artifacts fell into the bottom of the foundation.  The main finds in this area included bags full of glass, ceramics, brick, and bones.  The most notable artifact was the jawbone of an herbivore that is in very good condition.  Other bones were also found, but none as large as the jaw bone, which makes us wonder why animal bones would be within the house.</p>
<p>We also chose another unit inside of the foundation, near where the kitchen should have been.  This unit consisted mainly of bricks, but also included glass, ceramics, bone, and shell.  The major find in this unit, however, was not part of any of these categories.  We discovered a mother of pearl button in very good condition.  While excavating the foundation in another unit, a brass button was found and it too was in very good condition.  These two buttons are very important as it gives us a glimpse into the attire of the previous owners of the Joy/Flood site.</p>
<p>We then decided to excavate one final unit several meters outside of the foundation, in hopes of finding a well. At this juncture we have not relocated the well and have stopped excavating.  Many artifacts were found in the unit including a very large animal bone, which we assume is part of an animals leg, as well as a big pile of iron including two nails.  Although we found many artifacts, they do not always tell the complete story of the site.  For instance, a change in soil color can indicate what happened at the site and tell a story.  Archaeology is not only about finding artifacts or features, but learning about the culture and history of the people through artifacts.</p>

<p>In archaeology, it is important to understand how to dig and why we dig the way we do. Often people wonder “Why do they dig that way?” Well, the answer is for good reasons.  In order to dig the way we do, tools are the keys to success in the field.</p>
<p>For an archaeologist, the essentials tools are: a trowel, a whisk broom, a bucket, set of screens and paint brushes. A trowel is used to scrape the dirt slowly toward you so that you can see the ground you have just revealed. Never “dig”, just trowel! Whisk brooms and paint brushes are used to clean the loose dirt from the surface of the unit. Buckets are filled within the unit and carried to the screens, which have 1/8 and ¼ inch openings, to sift the dirt and check for missed artifacts.</p>
<p>Aside from the functions of the tools, one may ask, why dig they way we do? The answer is simple: digging is not merely just digging up dirt in hope of finding artifacts. We dig the way we do because sometimes digging level by level reveals the story in the dirt of the unit.</p>
<p>In a unit on the eastern side of the Joy/ Flood foundation we discovered an important historic event. For three days, we troweled  the surface, slowly scraping the soil. Using the trowel, whisking the soil into the bucket, and then sifting it, we realized that there was a distinctive change in the color of the soil. The west side of the unit was an obvious scarlet/red brown color while the east side remained gray like the soil in the level above. Using the whisk broom, we discovered ashes and charcoal in the reddish soil. If we had shoveled the dirt away, we would have never noticed the change in soil.</p>
<p>We think the change in soil colour represents the burning of a tree near the east side of the house. The tree was probably burned down before the house was built because the reddish soil is beneath soil that was mounded against the foundation during its construction. We can make this observation because of the technique we used to dig the unit. By using a trowel instead of a shovel, we were able to observe the changes in colour as we dug deeper into the unit. The methods we use in archaeology allow us to see what we see. The first step is to find the coordinate (see Megan’s and Amy’s post); the second step is to excavate.</p>
<p>Simply speaking, archaeology is not about diggin’, it is about peeling away layers of history hidden within each unit.</p>

<p>In general, context is the environment or situation which surrounds an object or event. In archaeology, context is what gives meaning to an object. Without context an artifact is insignificant. Archaeologically, it is defined as any discrete archaeological entity on a site.</p>
<p>At the Joy/Flood site we found several examples of context, for example, the foundation of the house. We have learned from the historical context that Dominicus Flood lived in the house with his entire family. This simple fact introduces all sorts of possibilities to explain the origins and significance of the artifacts located in the foundation. Speculative connection</p>
<p>The surrounding area also plays an important role providing context for the site itself. We know that much of the resident&#8217;s food supply came from the bay due to the easily accessible shore and the fact that the soil is not optimal for agriculture. The forest surrounding the site is comprised of very young trees, most no older than a hundred years. This context gives us the information we need to ascertain that the surrounding property were fields approximately 100 years ago, most likely used for animal grazing.</p>
<p>One significant aspect is the physical placement of artifacts in their context. For example, in 2008 more pieces of white earthenware (a type of pottery) were found on the eastern side of the site while a great deal of red earthenware was located on the western side. Thanks to context we know that whiteware is associated with serving and redware is more often associated with kitchen and cooking. From this we can conclude that the kitchen area was located on the western side of the house and the the dining area on the eastern side.</p>
<p>Another example is when we found a large amount of ceramics in one unit of the site (the middle of the foundation) and next to none in the unit just beyond the foundation. If we were to try and analyze that single sherd of ceramic without the knowledge of where it came from we would be at a loss. Within context we can puzzle to ourselves as to why the ceramic sherds are so localized in one unit and so absent in another.</p>
<p>As per Megan&#8217;s previous post, creating a grid allows you to record the context of the unit. This record allows the archaeologist to reconstruct the past. This is why the recording and collecting of data is so crucial to the success of the project.</p>
