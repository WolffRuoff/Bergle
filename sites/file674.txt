He addressed a thorny question for Civil War historians: Why did Grant win the war?<\/p>\n<p>The answer to this question, according to Bonekemper, lies as much in the mistakes Lee made as in the strategies Grant employed. In sum, Lee was too &#8220;offensive&#8221; in his strategy for the undermanned Confederacy, suffered intolerable casualties (209,000), and allowed his obsession with the Commonwealth of Virginia to obscure the broader interests of the Confederacy.<\/p>\n<p>Bonekemper&#8217;s presentation Wednesday treated the above question at length, and was followed by an animated Q&amp;A, offering further illustration that the U.S. Civil War is still very much in our consciousness as a nation.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks to Ed and to all who attended.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>Copyright FAQ<\/strong><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><em>Can I exceed 10 percent of the total when digitizing from books and posting them to my Blackboard account?<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The 10 percent rule is just a guideline, not written into law.

Contact Jon Macasevich, reserves assistant at the library. He can work with the Copyright Clearance Center or directly with publishers to obtain permission for you to use the amount beyond the fair use guideline of 10 percent. Funds are available, within reason, to cover the cost of these permissions.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>Was Aaron Swartz Right?<\/strong><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The\u00a0<em>Chronicle Review<\/em>\u00a0recently assessed the significance of the<strong><span style=\"color: #000000\"><a href=\"http:\/\/muhlenberg.idm.oclc.org\/login?url=http:\/\/search.ebscohost.com\/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=aph&amp;AN=85779303&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site\">\u00a0Aaron Swartz case<\/a><\/span><\/strong>\u00a0in terms of scholarly publishing. Was Aaron Swartz right along? Scuttlebutt is intrigued especially by this part of the Chronicle Review analysis:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Why do scholars still submit their articles to journals that are behind pay walls, and more important why do they serve as editors and referees for these journals (usually gratis)? They submit articles because there is still prestige attached to these journals and because online alternatives do not carry the same weight in tenure and promotion decisions. This is of course due to the general inertia of academic life. Academics need to do some soul searching: Is placing so much weight on tradition worth the cost to members of the profession and the public at large?<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We need to recognize that actions like Aaron Swartz&#8217;s civil disobedience are legitimate. They are attempts to liberate knowledge that rightly belongs to all of us but that has been acquired by academic publishers through tens of thousands of contracts of adhesion and then bottled up and released for exorbitant fees in what functionally amounts to an extortion racket.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Strong words.<\/p>\n<p>Publishing in open access journals certainly holds part of the answer to this problem. Also promising are mandates to release to the public articles based on publicly-funded research, like the mandate\u00a0<strong><span style=\"color: #000000\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/blog\/2013\/02\/22\/expanding-public-access-results-federally-funded-research\">announced<\/a><\/span><\/strong>just last week by the Obama administration.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>Library to Host NITLE Webinar on MOOCs<\/strong><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Trexler Library is a host site for the following webinar.
