								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the pioneer of the microcomputer revolution and co-founder of the multi-billion-dollar technology company known as Apple, Steve Jobs has completely transformed the technology world we know today, creating innovative, user-friendly, life-altering products used by billions of people all over the world.</p>
<p>In Chapter 31 of the book, <em>Steve Jobs</em>, author Walter Isaacson delves into the creation of the first legal and reliable media player/library that has the ability to play, download, and organize digital audio and video on personal devices. In the early 2000s, the music industry was plagued by an array of piracy services, including Napster, Grokster, Gnutella, and Kazaa that illegally provided songs for free online. Jobs once said, “From the earliest days at Apple, I realized that we thrived when we created intellectual property. If people copied or stole our software, we’d be out of business. If it weren’t protected, there’d be no incentive for us to make new software or product designs. If protection of intellectual property begins to disappear, creative companies will disappear or never get started. But there’s a simpler reason: It’s wrong to steal. It hurts other people. And it hurts your own character” (2011). In an effort to find a legal alternative that would benefit both the customer as well as the music companies, Steve Jobs met with AOL Time Warner and Sony. Working with these companies was a nightmare to say the least and every service they tried to set into motion failed due to complicated restrictions and clunky interfaces.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until Jobs managed to persuade the five top record companies in the nation to allow digital versions of their songs to be sold that the “iTunes Store” was created. Jobs proposed not only to sell entire albums, but also individual songs for 99 cents, giving record companies 70% profit for each song sold. Jobs insisted that going down this route would be more appealing than the monthly subscription model preferred by most music companies. Jobs was right. He was able to convince the head of the Universal Music Group, Doug Morris, that he had the talent to produce a software that would portray the artistic and technological vision that most music companies lacked. Although Morris worked with plenty of artists, ranging from U2 to Eminem to Mariah Carey, Jobs still had much more work to do. “Corralling the record labels to go along with the iTunes plan was not enough, however. Many of their artists had carve-outs in their contracts that allowed them personally to control the digital distribution of their music or prevent their songs from being unbundled from their albums and sold singly. So Jobs set about cajoling various top musicians, which he found fun but also a lot harder than he expected” (2011). After rigorous work and plenty of convincing, Jobs was able to unveil the iTunes Store on April 28<sup>th</sup>, 2003. He explained at San Francisco’s Moscone Center, “The iTunes Store would start with 200,000 tracks, and it would grow each day. By using the store, you can own your songs, burn them on CDs, be assured of the download quality, get a preview of a song before you download it, and use it with your iMovies and iDVDs to make the soundtrack of your life.” As we know today, iTunes launched with great success, starting by selling a million songs in just six days.</p>
<p>Overall, Steve Jobs understood that producing this kind of technology requires both intuition and creativity, all of which he had. In every Apple product on the market, it is apparent how much importance Job’s put into the company’s integrity, user-friendliness, and attention to detail. Without the iTunes library, we would probably still be illegally downloading our favorite songs from bootlegged companies. However, today we can enjoy the 11<sup>th</sup> version of this media management software, with features like new album art, on-demand music stations, AirPlay, and the ability to download countless amounts of music, movies, TV shows, podcasts, books, and apps, all thanks to Steve Jobs.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the peer-reviewed article,<em> Social Networking Sites in Romantic Relationships: Attachment, Uncertainty, and Partner Surveillance on Facebook</em>, scholars address how social media sites, particularly Facebook, affect romantic relationships both on- and offline. By accepting a person’s friend request, that person can access your photos, videos, status updates, list of friends, background information, and overall history on the site. Additionally, a friend can post statuses on your profile, message you privately, and also identify a relationship status between the two of you. It is extremely easy to create a Facebook page and with a click of a button, a person can readily access yours and others’ personal information.</p>
<p>Considering there is a large population of Facebook users who post and share their relationship status, many couples are affected by the world of social media. Statistics say that Facebook activities contribute to nearly 20% of divorce cases. “Within romantic relationships, it is common for individuals to stay apprised of the happenings in their partners’ lives. Communication within the couple, an interactive strategy, is the most straightforward way to garner this information, but it is common for partners to employ other information-seeking strategies to learn about their target (the other partner)” (Fox, 2014, p.3). For example, just as a girlfriend can watch from a distance how their boyfriend behaves around others, that girlfriend can just as easily gather information on her boyfriend through pictures he may post, conversations he may have, and pictures that he has liked or commented on. People who struggle with trust issues and jealousy tend to be the people who are most likely to “stalk” not only their partner’s profiles, but also profiles their partner is friends with. Through this kind of online surveillance, many couples either feel more secure in their relationship or more frequently, undergo serious complications.</p>
<p>Two main theories that tend to fuel online relationship “stalking” are the theory of relational uncertainty and the theory of attachment, which scholars, Fox and Warber, delve deeply into. “If a partner is unsure about the target’s feelings or intentions&#8230;the partner experiencing uncertainty may explore the content of the target’s profile to determine what the target is doing and who they are interacting with so that the partner can alleviate uncertainty about the relationship” (Fox, 2014, p.4). Not only is uncertainty problematic throughout the duration of the relationship, but it lingers after the breakup as well. Even if a couple physically separates, they are likely to still remain “friends” on Facebook. “This lingering connection—as well as access to the ex-partner’s post-breakup experiences via Facebook posts and pictures—may foster feelings of uncertainty about the relationship after dissolution”(Fox, 2014, p.4). Some partners may interpret this “connection” as hope that they may one day rekindle what they once had. This kind of person is likely to continuously monitor their ex-partner’s profile for clues about the ex’s relational ambitions and intentions. The theory of attachment is similar in that it revolves around a sense of anxiety. Scholars say that there are four distinct attachment styles, which include secure, preoccupied, dismissing, and fearful individuals. All of these qualities directly affect how a partner reacts to their significant other’s profile and how deeply they will investigate that profile.</p>
<p>While social networking sites have the potential to degrade relationship satisfaction, they can also keep a couple’s relationship alive, especially in cases of long-distance relationships. Platforms like Skype, FaceTime, Snapchat, and Google Chat allow partners to talk face to face, which can really enhance communication and a sense of connection between partners. Other sites like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter create outlets for couples to post pictures and videos together and write messages to one another. Furthermore, making a relationship “Facebook official” can send a message to others that you are in a committed relationship and can prevent others from romantically approaching both you and your partner.</p>
<p>Overall, its important to use social networking sites carefully when involved in a relationship. “The significance and potential effects of monitoring current and former romantic partners on Facebook”(Fox, 2014, p.6) has revolutionized the way people create and maintain relationships. While many couples have let social media negatively impact their relationship, some have found that it facilitates communication and support. If Facebook is creating conflict in your relationship, there is one easy solution and that is to reduce usage.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you have a twitter account or are involved in any type of social media, you have probably seen a “hashtag” before. We know hashtags most popularly as simple ways for people to search for tweets that have a common theme or topic. “Hashtags can be used to collect public opinion on events and ideas at the local, corporate, or world level” (&#8220;Hashtag&#8221;, 2015). For example, if you wanted to see people’s opinions of Donald Trump, you could simply search #DonaldTrump in the twitter search bar and get an entire feed of tweets pertaining to him. Hashtags are used for a variety of reasons and if promoted by enough people, can even “trend” and therefore attract more people to the topic at hand.</p>
<p>While many people may believe the “hashtag” originated on Twitter, it is actually not a Twitter function. Also known as the “number sign,” hashtags were first used in information technology to highlight a specific meaning. For example, “In 1978, Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie used # in the C programming language for special keywords that had to be processed first by the C preprocessor” (&#8220;Hashtag&#8221;, 2015). Later on, IRC networks began to use number signs to label channels or topics. A man named Chris Messina was inspired by the IRC and proposed a similar system to be used on Twitter, tweeting, “how do you feel about using # (pound) for groups. As in #barcamp?” (&#8220;Hashtag&#8221;, 2015) on August 23, 2007. This proposal became extremely popular and continued to grow as Twitter began to hyperlink all hashtags and eventually introduce “Trending Topics” on its front page. Hashtags are now used on a variety of different platforms, including Instagram, YouTube, Google, and even on television.</p>
<p>Businesses and advocacy organizations have especially taken advantage of the “hashtag” by connecting the popularity of social media with the promotion of their products, services, or campaigns. For example, “There is a collaboration between the social networking site Twitter and American Express that makes it possible to buy discounted goods online by tweeting a special hashtag. American Express members can sync their card with Twitter and use the offers by tweeting and look for a response in a tweet with the confirmation from American Express” (&#8220;Hashtag&#8221;, 2015). Not only can hashtags positively affect a business’ market, but they can also be used with a negative connotation, where they are better known as “bashtags.” Nowadays, it is extremely common for people to use social media platforms in order to complain about poor customer service or to criticize a company. Hashtags have the power of drawing attention to important issues and controversial topics.</p>
<p>Overall, people have found a countless amount of ways to use hashtags for their own benefit; whether to spark a conversation, start a trend, gain more followers, or to promote a specific event or campaign. For better or for worse, hashtags have become extremely powerful tools not only in social media, but in our everyday lives.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this article, Jessica Winter explains the science and psychology behind why not only Facebook is the “frenemy with the most heads,” (Winter, 2013, p.2) but more importantly why Instagram is the greatest threat to our mental well-being. Winter argues that our social media outlets reduce us as individuals to a whole new level of shallowness.</p>
<p>Instagram is one out of many socia media sites that makes it extremely easy to morph a sub-par photo into a top of the line photo you would find on the front of a magazine. These days, there are countless amounts of editing apps that can not only brighten or sharpen a picture, but can change a person’s skin tone, make blemishes disappear, smooth out wrinkles, and even make a person’s teeth whiter. This kind of false advertisement is the reason “You get more explicit and implicit cues of people being happy, rich, and successful from a photo than from a status update” (Winter, 2013, p.3). People will spend hours upon hours experimenting with different filters and editing every small imperfection in order to create the “perfect” Instagram post. Not only this, but then they have to come up with the “perfect” witty and creative caption to capture their followers’ attentions. People will even spend hours simply dwelling over which emoji or hashtag is best to use. Although I myself am faulty of the endless battle of what filter to use, which caption to write, and what emoji looks best, I do realize that it is insane how much effort goes into just one photo. And why put all of this energy into an Instagram post? The one and only answer is: LIKES! Instagram is the one form of social media where getting the <u>most</u> likes is the <u>most</u> important. A lot of people think that the more likes a person gets, the more they are liked in the “real world.” However, this theory can be far from the truth. People are so obsessed with getting likes on their photos that there are even businesses you can pay to buy likes. It is absurd!</p>
<p>“Krasnova’s research has led her to define what she calls an “envy spiral” peculiar to social media. “If you see beautiful photos of your friend on Instagram,” she says, “one way to compensate is to self-present with even better photos, and then your friend sees your photos and posts <em>even</em> <em>better</em> photos, and so on” (Winter, 2013, p.3). Although Krasnova may be making a valid point, I don’t believe it is right to generalize this conclusion to the whole population of social media users. Your personal reaction to others’ posts and pictures is merely a reflection of your own character and self-worth. If you dwell in self-pity and jealousy, it is inevitable that you will “enter into a semi-consensual sadomasochistic relationship” (Winter, 2013, p.2) with social media. It is not the filtered, over-edited picture of your skinny friend in a bikini at the beach that is to blame, it is yourself.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this article, Mike Hanski uncovers the ways in which reading can positively impact not only a person’s writing skills, but also a person’s quality of life. Hanski continuously argues that writing is not teachable and “can’t be got by simple learning of grammar rules, punctuation marks, and different writing techniques.” (Hanski, 2014, p.1). It seems that the only way to truly grasp the art of writing is to read other authors’ works and gain insight on the different techniques, wide array of vocabulary, and overall structure used.</p>
<p>In my personal experience, reading benefitted my writing skills greatly in taking the SATs last year. I dreaded opening the first page of my booklet to the 25-minute essay being that I was never prepared for what kind of prompt would be thrown at me. Most times, I would not be able to formulate my ideas concisely or even have any ideas at all for that matter. After receiving a 7 out of 12 my first time around, I took the initiative and decided it would be a good idea to read graded example essays that other students had written. I read essays that scored a 2 all the way to essays that scored a perfect 12. In doing this, I learned how to properly analyze all different types of prompts. I was able to recognize repeating patterns in both the low-scoring essays and high-scoring essays and eventually pinpoint my own mistakes. On the next SAT I took, I put to use all of the knowledge I gained from reading the sample essays and scored a 10 out of 12. Doing well on my essay helped me get a high overall SAT score, which helped me get into a good college, which will hopefully give me plenty of job opportunities in the future.</p>
<p>Not only does reading affect a person’s caliber of writing, but it “helps kids define who they are, as it connects them to the rest of the whole world” (Hanski, 2014, p.2). By widening a student’s vocabulary and deepening their knowledge, it is inevitable that they will become more well-versed and understanding of the world. Hanski explains that without these vital tools, social exclusion is a very plausible possibility. “Pupils who are functionally illiterate at 16 consider school a simple waste of time and become most likely unemployed by the age of 30, as they do not believe anything they do can have a real effect on their lives” (Hanski, 2014, p.2).</p>
<p>It is truly mind-blowing how the simple act of reading can influence a person’s life so positively or so negatively.</p>
