								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Internet has arguably become the most powerful thing known to mankind. It is one of the most popular and most widely used things by humans.  It has the ability to connect people worldwide literally making the world a smaller place. Online, you have the choice to be well known or anonymous, funny or serious, even evil or good hearted. The power of the Internet is unlimited and continues to grow every day. One of the scariest aspects of the Internet however is the fact that everybody has the ability to be anonymous. Anonymity is a very complicated thing, especially when it is applied on the Internet. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The video I watched was a TED Talk titled, </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Christopher &#8220;moot&#8221; Poole&#8221;: The case for anonymity online. Christopher Poole is famous for founding the anonymous imageboard website 4chan in which users can post anonymously on any topic they wish. It is famous for many memes including lolcats and rickroll. It is also notoriously known for many of the bad things the Internet has to offer. Interestingly enough, Poole did not really talk about the bad things that 4chan causes like the threats and the degradation of certain people. The closest thing he comes to talking about the bad side of 4chan are the rules, Poole says</span><span style="font-weight: 400">, “So does a site like this have rules? We do; they&#8217;re the codified rules that I&#8217;ve come up with, which are more-or-less ignored by the community.” This seems like an excuse that Poole is making. He is trying to explain that the fact that 4chan has a very negative connotation attached to it is not his fault. He even says, “The content is not dinner table conversation in the least.” This just shows how most of the content of 4chan is not of quality. I believe this is due to the fact that it is an anonymous site. I bet if 4chan required a username or picture that would eliminate the anonymity aspect of 4chan, the site would be very different from what it is like now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anonymity is also a very dangerous thing on the Internet because many people think that since they are anonymous they can do whatever they want. This is not the case, Poole says, </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And last, I&#8217;m going to show you the example, the story of Dusty the cat. Dusty is the name that we&#8217;ve given to this cat. This young man posted a video of him abusing his cat on YouTube. And, you know, this didn&#8217;t sit well with people, and so there was this outpouring of support for people to do something about this. So what they did is they &#8212; I mean, they put CSI to shame here &#8212; the Internet detectives came out.They matched, they found his MySpace. They took the YouTube video and they mashed everything in the video. Within 24 hours, they had his name, and within 48 hours, he was arrested.”</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This just shows how no matter what you do online and no matter how anonymous it is you might end up getting caught for something bad that you did. You always have to be aware of the consequences of every action, even online.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Overall, the Internet is anonymous whether we like it or not. I believe that you can have a great time on the Internet as long as you are safe. Since the Internet is anonymous you can have no idea who is who online therefore it is important to act just the way you would in real life. Sites like 4chan encourage bad behavior because of the anonymity aspect if it. One of the most important aspects of the internet that more people should follow is to be more aware of how they are behaving online.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“You have to see it to believe it.” Those were the words of a young student referring to the new learning methods used in his classroom. (Google for Education, 2015) In the 21<sup>st</sup> century, it has become incredibly unrealistic when teaching students about the variety of places around the world. However, this is coming to an end. What if you could see anywhere in the world all through a single lens? With Google Cardboard and the company’s new Expeditions program, this has been made possible. Today’s society is in the midst of excessive technological growth and change. Things are being done now that were never imaginable back in the day. Google’s Expeditions Pioneer Program brings class lessons to life. It offers an enriched experience that’s more interactive by letting students enter a world beyond their imagination by putting the globe right before their eyes. Learning has become that much easier.</p>
<p>Many believe it’s hard to learn the true meaning of a place without visiting it in person. Luckily for them, this is all about to change. Just a few years ago, Google unveiled a virtual reality headset known as Google Cardboard. And now it’s taking that one step further. Google’s Expeditions program lets you go places that were never thought conceivable. The program has already reached classrooms in the United States, United Kingdom, Brazil and Australia with many to come. But what’s so great about it? All for an exceptionally low cost, anyone can travel the world through a single lens. It’s quite remarkable.</p>
<p>With Cardboard, Google reinvented virtual reality. While textbooks are a great source for information, they’re sometimes hard to get and not everyone can afford them. Taking the subject Geography for example, while textbooks can show you a bevy of images taken from various places and wonders of the world, they don’t supply a full experience. This has left many wanting something more. According to (Google for Education, 2015), one of Expedition’s major strengths consists of just about anyone being able see the world through a lens in three-hundred and sixty degrees. Students can now walk through the jungle, visit the Great Wall of China, climb through the mountains, and even dive into the deep blue ocean. Many agree that this is the future of education and are shaken by how far technology has come. This relates to our class discussions at the beginning of the semester regarding recent technological growth. The experience is like no other. It’s believed by many that student takeaways will be much larger than one’s gains from just reading. Teachers believe it’s essential that students are able to see what they’re actually learning about in order to learn it properly.</p>
<p>An Expedition can best be described as a guided tour in which schools and buses aren’t capable of. While the list of places is quite vast already, it’s always growing to capture the world. Using Cardboard virtual reality headsets, students can physically walk around on the moon or fly over the Rocky Mountains just by tilting their head and pointing towards a certain direction. During the session, teachers can point out highlights while discussing their class notes at the same time. Many have come to the conclusion that this immerse experience makes learning more fun, interactive and thrilling, which can be seen in the video (Google for Education, 2015) during the student’s reactions. The headset is composed of nearly all cardboard keeping the price down, and thus allowing students all around the world to gain access to it.</p>
<p>Can you imagine sitting in class and visiting some the world’s greatest monuments without ever leaving the room? Now students can live this dream. The journey of Expeditions has just begun. Students worldwide can now see what it’s like in another continent or biome without the need to travel there. With the development of this product along with many others, it has become clear that technology has grown to a point where many can’t even believe the outcomes. There’s so much out there to see in such a small life span, and this device helps us conquer the world at our own convenience. Relating back to the common theme, it’s these experiences that will allow students to thrive in their academics, further enhance their education and develop a better understanding of the world around them. Who knows where it will take us next.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Look around you, look to your left, to your right, behind you and now back at yourself. Everyone you saw including yourself is a liar, we are all liars. While sitting at the dining hall, on the second floor enjoying my lunch one afternoon I noticed from a birds eye view all the different conversations people were having. I wasn’t eavesdropping, just to clarify but I did hear from up above, “No, that dress doesn’t make you look fat!” I wasn’t going to judge that girl on her response but it led me to wonder why people disguise the truth and how often they do it. I could not get my mind off this subject, thinking to myself how often I might be lied to on any given day and how I might be able to detect it. I went online, quickly flipping through article after article until I found a Ted talk entitled, “How to Spot a Liar” by Pamela Meyer. I was enlightened on what she had to say.</p>
<p>She answered all of the questions that flooded my head earlier that day, providing in depth explanations to the complexities of deception and how deception and lies can impact not only our social lives but our lives on a much bigger scale as well. There are a few elemental facts about lying, one being that it is a collegial action. Not every lie is catastrophic, but there are certainly many willing participants who take part in deception for the sake of their social dignity, i.e.: the case with the dress. These willing participants are the ones who kick start deception to a whole new level. Ones who constantly lie and manipulate may think that their wrong doing will impact only those directly involved but as we have seen in recent history that is not the case. Back in 2010 for example, Bernie Madoff deceived the entire nation single handedly into just under trillions of dollars in debt. It is the unwilling participants who are affected most and lies like these so evidently betray our country by jeopardizing security and undermining our government.</p>
<p>We are all opposed to lying, but frequently do it in so many different ways. What’s astonishing is that you could potentially be lied to up to 200 times in any given day (Meyer). And even worse, strangers lie about 3 times within the first 10 minutes of meeting each other (Meyer). And on top of that, by the time kids reach college they lie to their mom on average 1 out of every 5 interactions !(Meyer). Now that makes me feel like a terrible son. Lies and deception occur everywhere, we encounter unavoidable spam in our emails, fake digital friends on Facebook, identity thieves and Ponzi schemes and it is all because our world is changing faster than we could have ever anticipated. Meyer said “it’s transparent with blogs and social networks broadcasting the buzz of a whole new generation of people that have made a choice to live their lives in public” (Meyer).  We complain about privacy rights and manipulative media but we are the ones deceiving one another. The advanced new world texting and tweeting blind us to the basic subtleties of human decency.</p>
<p>Take another look around the room, the people and yourself deserve an honorable society where truth can be heightened and promoted and one where deception is publicized.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Andy Yen discusses the role of privacy in today’s technologically driven society and how it has become almost nonexistent. His Ted Talk entitled, <em>Think your email’s private? Think again.</em> focuses on the matter of email and how many people are blind to the fact that all emails are visible to the public. Everything on the internet creates data, and what’s alarming is the notion that, “our data now lasts forever, so your data can and will outlive you.” (Yen, 2014) Data not only reveals personal information about us, but also indicates who we interact with, where we are, and what we think about. This summation of data open to the public officially deteriorates the concept of privacy, for the new generation of digital natives are taught to share everything about themselves online.</p>
<p>With regard to email, Yen makes an interesting comparison to postcards. He discusses how emails are not private and are the equivalent of sending a postcard, since, “everybody that sees it from the time it leaves your computer to when it gets to the recipient can actually read the entire contents.” (Yen, 2014) This observation is alarming because if the entire internet can read your emails, the comparison to text messaging must be analogous. Invasion of privacy has become such an integral part of this digital generation that it raises the fear of becoming a new social norm. The uses of this bank of information and data is endless. The government is the obvious thought that comes to mind when posing the question of, “Who’s listening or watching on the other end?” Next comes big businesses and all of their marketing tactics to sell personalized products to us, however, besides the government and big business, who else has an interest in our lives? It’s an important question to ask ourselves when choosing what we post online.</p>
<p>Yen proposes a way to secure our information to prevent the public from gaining access to our emails. The solution that already exists is called encryption, however common people do not have the skillset to execute that process. What Andy and his team of scientists developed is an app entitled ProtonMail. Created in the cafeteria of the European Organization for Nuclear Research, CERN, ProtonMail enables the average person to send automatically encrypted emails without the, “server being able to read what’s going on”, or the user seeing the encryption. To the users, they are emailing their friends and family as normal, however the emails are not open to the public to read or save as data. It is quite genius how Andy and his team made the extremely complicated process of encryption into an easy app that allows individuals to ensure their privacy and live without the eyes of the public watching their every move.</p>
<p>ProtonMail is beneficial because privacy has become a foreign concept in this digital age. This app makes privacy an option for the average person who otherwise would not know or understand how to encrypt his/her emails. Andy’s activism towards privacy reform is inspiring and significant to the movement because he emphasizes how if, “we want to have privacy online, what we have to do is we’ve got to go out and get it ourselves.” (Yen, 2014) It’s an absurd concept, the act of fighting for our privacy. Privacy should be a basic human right, for I thought it was very clearly protected in the Fourth Amendment. However, through manipulation and corruption within the marketing industry and federal government, people have found loopholes to gain access to our entire lives which have now essentially been posted online. The lack of privacy in this world is a, “global issue that impacts all of us&#8230;We have to build an Internet where privacy is no longer just an option, but is also the default.” (Yen, 2014) Through people like Andy, the fight for privacy is gaining extensive support. It has surpassed just the development of new technological innovations and has become a fierce confrontation with the oppression of human rights.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Social media is a platform which allows the teens of today’s world to communicate with other people from all around the world and from all walks of life. In theory, social media is a positive mechanism that brings all people closer together. However, in reality, the complete opposite is true. As explained in the YouTube video “How social media is affecting teens,” the youth of today are being harmed by too much social media interaction. The ways in which they are being affected does not refer to one’s impaired eye sight from staring at a screen for too long or obesity from reduced activity. Rather, this destruction is attributed to the desire to be famous (The National, 2014).</p>
<p>Researcher Yalda Uhls conducted a few experiments on teenagers in Los Angeles and elementary school students in Canada (The National, 2014). The basis of the experiment was to get the kids to write down a personalized list of the top 16 lifetime goals and aspirations that they valued the most in order of importance (The National, 2014). When this experiment was conducted in the past the 15th goal, which can be assumed to be almost the least important, was typically fame. Uhls’ results were the complete opposite during the most recent version of the similar experiment; the majority of teens that were involved in this study had fame as their number one want in life (The National, 2014). According to Uhls, this sudden desire to be famous is closely linked to the increased use of social media today. This escalation in time spent being engaged with some nature of technology is not allowing teens to have time for reflection whether it be of oneself or another person. In turn, this causes these technology-driven teens to have less empathy for others which subsequently leads to a generation full of people who do not care about the well-being of others (The National, 2014). This statistic is just another aspect in which social media is damaging society.</p>
<p>Obviously teens are not spending 100% of their time on social media sites. Whenever their nose is not in the phone however, they are sometimes mesmerized by a program that is on television. These programs go hand in hand with social media and can be used to explain why today’s teens have such an overambitious want to be famous (The National, 2014). Some of the most popular television shows from the past decade deal with people being liked and becoming famous. For example, <em>Hannah Montana</em> was about a girl who was an average teenager by day and an iconic pop star by night and <em>American Idol</em> was about average people auditioning in front of judges and competing against other contestants to be recognized as a wonderful singer (The National, 2014). Although both of these shows no longer exist, they are certainly what today’s teens grew up watching which makes them relevant to the issue at hand.</p>
<p>In the long run, it can be argued that parents are the culprits to be blamed for this unrealistic infatuation that teens possess (Marshall, 2009). More and more often today you see children who can’t walk or talk yet but are toying with an iPad and navigating through the device better than most adults would be able to. Parents who shove technology in the faces of children just so they will stop bothering them are the ones who are kick starting the obsession with social media and therefore, the desire to be famous. If children were taught that being famous is not everything from the beginning then society would not be faced with a bunch of young teens who only care about how many likes their selfie got on Instagram.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In ‘It&#8217;s Complicated: The Social Lives of Networked Teens’, Danah Boyd the author, clarifies answers to the generational question of why do teens act the way they do online? Digital natives, being mostly teenagers these days, use social media as a way of creating and expressing their identity. But what does is lost in translation is who these teens believe are viewing their online persona.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One thing teens think of less often than not when posting to social media is the context collapse that they are faced with. This refers to the effects of social media and the infinite audience that is possible online as opposed to the limited groups a person normally interacts with. Sometimes it is easy to forget that just because we think we have control over who is viewing our content we actually don’t. This can bring about severe misinterpretations because our perceived audience is not always what we believe it to be. Teens these days are getting lost in the realm of imagined audiences rather than actual audiences. Every Time teens log onto social media they are faced with the notion of having an invisible audience. They know who they want their content to reach but simultaneously have no control over it. Consequences of these misinterpretations are especially exaggerated when it comes to things such as the college application. Possible applicants are usually warned to clean up their social media footprint in hopes of leaving no possibility of an unintended interpretation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When we are faced with an invisible audience we refer in our head to who we wish to appeal to but that invisible audience that exists can mean anything from teachers to childhood friends that are actually viewing our content. Some teens recognize that with applications such as Facebook and its increasing ability to connect people with one another, even with privacy settings, content reaches people much further than just those who they have accepted as friends or decide to follow, only increasing the invisible audience. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So next time you decide update the persona you hold online, whether that be with pictures or a status, think about who is actually seeing who you are online and decide if what you are putting online is worth the consequence of not always knowing who will be viewing it. </span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s bizarre to think of the world without the internet. Society has become so accustomed to the use of it, that it is odd to think that there once was a time that it did not exist. The initial use of technology has now become so prevalent in the work force, that everyone often forgets that not too long ago, it was not available at the tough of your finger tips. You could not just email a presentation to your boss or type up word documents and spreadsheets. These new perks all made their appearance in the late 80s and 90s after the internet was first conceived. Patricia Wallace, the author of <i>The Internet In The Workplace</i>, refers to the internet as a ‘desktop gateway to the world.’ She explains,“It changed the context of work, the context of business in general, and the context of entire industries” (Wallace, 2004, p. 2).</p>
<p>The birth of the internet did indeed create a whole new dynamic of the work place with the help of these new technologies. Patricia discusses how the use of the internet helps assist companies in many ways, the most being the 24/7 access. It’s now possible for an employee to work even when they are not physically sitting in their office. All aspects of a company can be accessed from the outside. Other employees can be contacted, work can be done, and information can be sent to different people. It is also much easier for training new employees. It prevents you from having to waste both time and money. This new learning, e-learning, makes it much easier for both companies and future employees.</p>
<p>Technology has infiltrated the work force, and it is overall for the better. The workplace endured a technological revolution that is increasingly improved it. Some may ask whether that is a positive or negative. Why would it be a negative? It has brought many great aspects to the workforce that were did not exist many year ago.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Through my research, I have found that the Maximum Power, Darwin, Lotka, Energy Law, and Fourth Energy Law, found within chapter 3 of “Environment, Power, and Society”, by Howard T. Odum, can be used as a theory backing a recent innovation created by the company Sunatics for a solar charger which is a solution for limiting the amount of carbon dioxide within our air that affects our bodies, resulting in damaged blood vessels. This problem is also the controlling problem within the peer reviewed article “The Effects of Pollution”, which is a study done by the University of Toronto and published by American Fitness. The study conducted by University of Toronto, “The Effects of Pollution”, examined 25 healthy humans inhaling elevated concentrations of fine particles and ozone for two hours. After exposure, the volunteers’ blood vessels constricted between 2% and 4% on average (American Fitness). One can only imagine the toll that air pollution has taken on the millions of people around the world. This is disturbing because we as an intellectual society have found numerous ways to limit the amount of air pollution, yet we still haven’t utilized them efficiently. Interestingly enough, one of the many truths towards how we can limit our air pollution can be found in the studies of some of the greatest minds throughout history. In the 19<sup>th</sup> century Darwin popularized the concept of natural selection, and then during the early 20<sup>th</sup> century Lotka indicated that the maximization of power for useful purposes was the criterion for natural selection (Odum). Combining their two laws we find a central ideology that the species that uses the power found within the resources given to them will live the longest and maintain dominance within the idea of Natural Selection. Later Odum states “Systems that prevail are those with loading adjusted to operate at the peak of power efficiency”. What I find most interesting about this idea is how Odum uses the word “Systems”. A system is a set of things working together as parts of a mechanism or an interconnecting network. If humans are an interconnected network, then why aren’t we using all of our given resources in order to lower the amount of air pollution within our society? Our society has created more thane enough innovations to reduce air pollution, for example Sunatics new portable battery changer. “Our solar chargers require no batteries to operate, it’s important to have a portable solar charger that does not use batteries”, this limits the amount of energy used creating a society that will work as a system, cleaning our air all over the earth. Air pollution affects all life. Although humans are often depicted as selfish beings, we need clean air in order to maintain stability within our lives and a healthy lifestyle. The effects of air pollution are way more rapid and life changing then we could ever even imagine. The longer we choose to sit around and not use the available resources within our society in order to improve the qualities of our health, the more we are killing one another. The University of Toronto found that the constriction caused by air pollution could conceivably trigger cardiac events in individuals who have or are at risk for heart disease. I agree with the argument being placed by this university because if the most well respected minds within the science world understand the idea that the earth is a system within itself and has the proper tools to act as a proper system but the living organisms within it must abide by its rules and use its resources, then this problem of air pollution is solvable. The earth was created with the resources in order to fix the problems that its species create. Ultimately it comes down to whether we care enough about our health to act and make a difference in this world or to sit around and let our earth wither away.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The post apocalyptic novel, <u>Brave New World</u> by Aldous Huxley, discusses how the misuse and abuse of technology can lead to the disintegration of creativity and independent thinking. Specific to Chapter Sixteen, Mustapha Mond provides the reader with more insight into his role as world controller and confronts Bernard, Helmholtz, and John the Savage about their looming fate of being removed from civilization due to their extensive knowledge. Mustapha Mond opens up about his past and reveals that he used to be a scientist himself, for he was given the same threat of being sent to an isolated island. Instead of removing himself from society, Mond became a world controller and since then has been conditioning his citizens to conform to various social classes, each one being emotionless, imprisoning, and filled with people who are constantly inebriated.</p>
<p>The key elements of this society are happiness and stability, for each social class is articulately devised to be content working on the tasks they are told to complete. For example, “Only an Epsilon can be expected to make Epsilon sacrifices, for the good reason that for him they aren’t sacrifices; they’re the line of least resistance” (Huxley, 1932). This medical intervention of human reproduction produces babies made to contribute to society in a specific way, there is no room for self discovery or liberty and everything has a prescribed method with no room for spontaneity. People are not able to freely express themselves, for their emotions are stripped away, leaving them in a constant state of “happiness”. But what is happiness if there is no unhappiness? Huxley parallels the themes of power and technology, for in the brave new world these go hand in hand. The government controls the technology and therefore, also the minds and actions of every person.</p>
<p>John argues with Mond over the concept of “old”, for John doesn’t understand why he’s the only person who appreciates Shakespeare and literature. Mond explains how when the past is beautiful, it takes people out of the present and more importantly, out of the future. People gain a basis of thought by looking back into the past. They are able to hear about the past, form an opinion about it, and decide how they want to proceed in the future. The old influences the new. It provokes collaboration, inspiration, and influences the way people think and creatively express themselves. Mond specifically points out how new scientific development leads to instability, for he believes that, “every discovery in pure science is potentially subversive; even science must sometimes be treated as a possible enemy&#8230;Science is dangerous; we have to keep it most carefully chained and muzzled.” (Huxley, 1932) This claim highlights Huxley’s growing dissatisfaction with government involvement in scientific and creative expression, for the more power a government has over technology and the human masses, the more corruption is prevalent. Objects, ideas, and discoveries that are old give people a sense of nostalgia, memory, and physical thought. Mond’s goal is to eliminate thinking and enforce the values of short term gratification provided by drugs, technology, and sex. Mond uses technology and hypnopaedic conditioning to breed these brainwashed, thoughtless people and design them to only want more, to only want new, to move from partner to partner in a mindless and routinely fashion. Huxley shines a light on this over-involvement of governmental policy on the human body to depict the consequences of what happens when the progression of science and art are tampered with. With a society blindly following the technology controlled by the government, manipulation pervades the mind of each individual and creates a mass of absentminded robots.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As society is evolving so is social medias language. Through the internet people have discovered new ways to communicate easily while not actually having to use full coherent sentences. Chapter six in <em>How Blogs and Twitter Ate Transforming Popular Culture </em>written by Mary Cross, she states “Without editors or gatekeepers, language on the Internet is in constant flux, experimental at best, ungrammatical at worst” (2011, p 85). Visual information gets to the brain a lot faster so social media has been able to translate words and emotions into emoticons. Through emoticons one is able to express their emotions and thoughts to friends or family in a quick and easy to understand manner. It is very hard for people to read a tone text message, you may send a message with a joking tone but the receivers might take it the wrong way and think you were being rude or overly sarcastic. With emotions and expressions being translated into emoticons it makes it easier for people to be able to get a sense of the text messages tone because a quick smiley face at the end of the sentence can go along way.</p>
<p>A huge theme that is constantly changing over the years is the use of slang words. As culture evolves so does slang, there will always be more words that are “in” during that year. This year specifically those words consisted of “no chill”, “FOMO”, “turnt”, “on fleek”, “bae”, “yas”, and many more. There have been people looking into whether or not slang effects the way one writes essays and complete assignments but some say other wise, “Yet experts who study these things say that language offline has not ben measurably affected, that students can still put together coherent papers in full sentences, and, even, that all the extra writing they are doing online is improving their mastery of written langue” (2011, p 86). Even thought students these days use slang more often than not it has not yet effect our ability to write properly. It is important that as our culture changes we do not begin slipping away from the English grammar and spelling, we cannot let slang take over the English dictionary.</p>
<p>Chapter six also touches upon a major theme in that there is a difference between the male language and female language. In regard to the use of emoticons and slang females tend to have more length texts apply more emoticons where as males tend to be more short and to the point with less use of emoticons. On a more serious note when it comes to proper English and professional writings there were specific difference brought to my attention through this chapter. Linguistics professor Naomi S Baron, who is the author of <em>Always on </em>states that, “Women also tend to use more qualifiers, are more polite, stick to standard usage, and use conversation to enhance social interactions, while men converse to convey information” (2011, p 90). Over all I agree with this statement however I do not believe that men only talk to convey information, I feel as though women are more polite than men by using conversation to interact but men also do that too, just not as often. Baron also touches upon the fact that women tend to disguise themselves online so that they are able to speak out loud with out getting bashed on the internet however this is not what women should have to do to speak their mind.</p>
<p>Again as society begins to develop so does our language, so it is important that we do not let slang get in the way of being professional students nor let society gender norms hold you back from expressing our own thoughts to the public.</p>
