					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Great article and analysis here.  As Google becomes less of an online search company and more of a traditional media company, it is looking for ways in which is can control the content that web users are looking for, just like traditional media conglomerates are held together by their movie studio and production divisions. This is what the purchase of YouTube was all about, and this seems to be an even greater expansion of that producer-creator merge here.  Good job wrestling with all of the complicated power roles here!  As you can tell, the power roles become much more murky when you&#039;re dealing with online media as opposed to traditional media outlets.&lt;/p&gt;
