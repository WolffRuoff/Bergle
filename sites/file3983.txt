								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For my whole life, my family has followed the practices of Reform Judaism. For those of you who don&#8217;t know, it is a very relaxed, non rule-oriented, approach on religion. And from the time I was 11 years old in the fall of 2007, until I graduated this past June, I learned through the lenses of a similar style Jewish education. I followed the routine of Hebrew/Jewish studies classes and Friday services semester after semester for essentially all my teenage years.</p>
<p>Each year when September and October came around, a large portion of people I knew would temporary adjust their life in preparation for the &#8220;high holidays.&#8221; School would be canceled and my family and I would go to services, followed by a family dinner at my cousin&#8217;s house. We all discussed what we were going to make better for the new year while enjoying the time spent together. That was the annual holiday plan.</p>
<p>Now that I am 2704 miles away from home, ironically at a Lutheran-affiliated college, this week has been about figuring out how to reinvent the holiday season for myself.</p>
<p>Luckily for me, Muhlenberg, or as some have called it &#8220;Jewlenberg,&#8221; is not lacking in a Jewish community. For Rosh Hashanah this past Wednesday, many of my newly acquainted M.O.T (standing for Member of The Tribe or Jewish ) friends and I flocked to the beautiful Hillel for Kugel, grilled potatoes, and spiced chicken. We sang a few songs, said a few prayers, and devoured the delicious food.</p>
<p>Breaking the tradition of dinner with the family at my cousins interestingly gave me a different perspective on the holiday. Being taken out of my &#8220;Jewish element&#8221; of LA has stirred new feelings of strong Zionism. The prayers were almost refreshing to my soul as they left my mouth, and I felt honored to reconnect with my religion in company of so many other great people.</p>
<p>All in all, I would say my first Jewish holiday away from home was a momentous success. Happy new year!</p>
