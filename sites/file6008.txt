</em></p>
<p><strong>Volleyball at Washington College (Saturday, 12:30); vs. Lancaster Bible (Saturday, 2:30)<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Both teams came out of the gates in history-making fashion this year. Washington (14-5, 0-3) won nine of its first 10 matches for the first time in 36 years but has stumbled in Centennial Conference play, getting swept by Johns Hopkins, Gettysburg and Swarthmore in its first three league matches.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg, on the other hand, has remained hot and enters the tri-match having won 11 in a row to tie a school record. The Mules (18-2, 5-0) are off to their best CC start ever and are tied for first place with Swarthmore (which hosts McDaniel in a huge match on Saturday) and Haverford (idle Saturday).</p>
<p>A sweep of Washington and Lancaster Bible (13-8) would tie this year&#8217;s volleyball squad for the second-fastest to 20 wins in a season in Muhlenberg athletic history.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg has a 19-2 series lead against Washington, its lone losses coming in 1994 and 2010.</p>

<p><strong>Field Hockey at Washington College (Saturday, 1:00)<br />
</strong></p>
<p>The marquee matchup of the Mules&#8217; four on the shore is this game between two of the early leaders in the CC.</p>
<p>Washington (10-1, 3-1) has its best record after 11 games ever, losing only in double overtime to Johns Hopkins. Since then, the Shorewomen have won five in a row, outscoring their last three CC opponents by an 18-2 margin.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg (8-2, 4-1) comes in with a four-game winning streak that includes two victories against 2013 CC semifinalists Haverford and 20th-ranked Dickinson. The Mules are 8-2 after 10 games for the first time since 2003.</p>
<p>Both Muhlenberg and Washington have received votes in the Division III poll this season.</p>
<p>Washington leads the all-time series, 12-10, and had taken three meetings in a row before the Mules&#8217; 4-0 win last year. Muhlenberg has won three of the last four meetings in Chestertown.</p>

<p>Muhlenberg, ranked 20th by D3soccer.com, has experienced a little bit of everything in its four scheduled road games to date: a tie, a loss in double overtime, a game postponed due to weather and a game postponed due to field conditions. The Mules (7-1-2, 2-1-1) will look to add a win to that list.</p>
<p>Washington (4-6-1, 0-3-1) is winless in its last six games and has allowed a CC-high 19 goals this season. The Shoremen have long been a tough opponent no matter their record and this year is no exception; they lost by one goal to nationally ranked Salisbury and Dickinson.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg leads the all-time series, 24-1-2, with Washington&#8217;s lone win coming in Allentown in 2008. Of the 10 meetings in Chestertown since the start of CC play in 1993, six were decided by one goal and one ended in a tie.</p>

<p><strong><strong>Women&#8217;s Soccer at Washington College (Saturday, 4:00)</strong></strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg (6-3-2, 2-2) opened the season with a school-record seven-game unbeaten streak but is winless in its last four. A win would put the Mules in the thick of the playoff race and back on track heading into Tuesday&#8217;s home game against 2013 CC runner-up Haverford.</p>
<p>Washington (3-6-1, 0-3) is still looking for its first goal in CC play this year and has won only once in 16 CC games dating back to the 2012 season.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg has won all 16 all-time meetings with Washington by a combined score of 51-3. The Shorewomen&#8217;s last goal against the Mules came in 2003.</p>

Plus, a big football game that could determine a trip to the NCAA playoffs.<br />
</em></p>
<p><strong>Field Hockey vs. Johns Hopkins (Friday, 7:00)</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg (4-2) was on a roll before dropping its Centennial Conference opener at McDaniel last Friday and has had a week to prepare for this game. Johns Hopkins (4-4) won its first CC game in double-overtime against Washington last Saturday.</p>
<p>Both teams have prepared for the season with strong schedules. The Mules&#8217; five non-CC opponents are a combined 21-13 (which includes an 0-6 by Drew) against other teams, and Muhlenberg is responsible for the only loss by ninth-ranked Montclair State. The Blue Jays&#8217; last two losses were to the teams ranked second (Salisbury) and third (TCNJ) in the most recent Division III poll.</p>
<p>Johns Hopkins has won the last four meetings to extend its series lead to 18-5. Last year, Muhlenberg could not hold an early 1-0 lead and lost, 2-1.</p>

<p><strong>Football vs. Johns Hopkins (Saturday, 2:00)</strong></p>
<p>The lone home event on Saturday is a powerhouse matchup of the two pre-eminent programs in the Centennial Conference this century.</p>
<p>Since the start of the 2000 season, Johns Hopkins is 81-24 (.771) in CC play and has won or shared nine championships. Muhlenberg is right behind at .714 and seven titles. No other team is close.</p>
<p>Johns Hopkins, the five-time defending champion, has won 32 of its last 33 CC games and is ranked 12th in the AFCA poll. Muhlenberg, which has finished second three straight years, is ranked 23rd. It is believed to be the first CC game ever between two top-25 teams.</p>
<p>And while it&#8217;s still early in the season, the winner of this game has gone on to represent the CC in the NCAA Tournament every year but one since 2002.</p>
<p>Both teams are 3-0, with only one close game (the Blue Jays&#8217; 27-20 win at Susquehanna). Muhlenberg, which has won nine straight regular-season home games since a 2012 loss to Johns Hopkins, has outscored its first three opponents by a combined 118 points.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg leads the all-time series, 23-22-1, but Johns Hopkins has won four of the last five meetings. The last three years, the Mules led 10-7 in the third quarter, trailed 13-7 at halftime and trailed 14-13 late in the second quarter but wound up losing all three games by double-digit margins.</p>

<p><strong>Volleyball at Johns Hopkins (Saturday, 1:00)</strong></p>
<p>A rematch of the 2013 Centennial Conference championship match pairs up the two hottest teams in the CC. Muhlenberg (14-2, 2-0) has won seven in a row, while Johns Hopkins (9-8, 1-0), which faced many nationally ranked opponents in the early part of its schedule, has captured its last six.</p>
<p>The CC has been characterized by tightly contested matches this season, with four of the seven matches &#8211; including both played the Mules &#8211; going a full five sets. Hopkins won its opening CC match in three sets against Washington.</p>
<p>The three-time defending CC champion Blue Jays lead the all-time series, 18-5, and have won the last five meetings, including a 3-0 sweep in the regular season and a 3-1 win in the CC final last year. Muhlenberg&#8217;s last series win came in Baltimore in 2009.</p>

<p><strong>Women&#8217;s Soccer at Johns Hopkins (Saturday, 1:00)</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg (6-1-1, 2-0) is looking to rebound from its first loss of the season, a last-minute heartbreaker against Scranton on Tuesday. A win would put the Mules at 3-0 in the Centennial Conference for the first time since 2001.</p>
<p>Johns Hopkins isn&#8217;t the ideal opponent for a team trying to return to the win column: The Blue Jays (7-2, 1-0) are ranked eighth by D3soccer.com and are 32-1-1 in their last 34 CC regular-season games.</p>
<p>Hopkins leads the all-time series, 16-9-1, and won both meetings last year, 5-0 in the regular season, when it was ranked No. 1 in the country, and 8-0 in the CC semifinals. Since 2009, the Mules have posted three upsets of Blue Jay teams ranked in the top 10, including a 2-0 win in 2012.</p>

<p><strong>Men&#8217;s Soccer at Gettysburg (Saturday, 4:00)</strong></p>
<p>Undefeated Muhlenberg (6-0-1, 1-0) hits the road for the first time this season for the first of three games in seven days against regionally ranked Centennial Conference opponents. The Mules are ranked third in the region themselves and appear in the top 25 in both Division III polls.</p>
<p>Gettysburg (7-1, 1-0), which has not made the CC playoffs since 2010, is off to a 7-1 start, its best in eight years. The Bullets are ranked seventh in the Mid-Atlantic Region, their lone loss coming to top-ranked Messiah.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg has allowed a CC-low three goals all season, while Gettysburg is coming off back-to-back four-goal games against Ursinus and Marymount.</p>
<p>The Mules lead the all-time series, 35-19-6, but had their eight-game series winning streak snapped with a 2-1 overtime loss last year.</p>

<p><strong>Women&#8217;s Golf at Susquehanna Fall Invitational (Saturday); at Gettysburg Invitational (Sunday)</strong></p>
<p>The Mules will log plenty of time on the golf course this weekend, competing on back-to-back days for the first time this year.</p>
<p><strong>Men&#8217;s Tennis at ITA Southeast Regional (Saturday and Sunday)</strong></p>

</em></p>
<p><strong>Field Hockey at McDaniel (Friday, 7:00)</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg (4-1) begins its quest for a second consecutive playoff berth with a trip to Maryland. The Mules come in with a four-game winning streak and have allowed only three goals &#8211; tied for the fewest in the CC &#8211; in five games.</p>
<p>McDaniel (4-2) brings a three-game winning streak into its CC opener. The Green Terror has not made the playoffs since 2006 and had a 3-7 CC record &#8211; its worst since 1999 &#8211; last year.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg leads the all-time series, 12-9, and has won the last two meetings. The last game played in Westminster was a wild back-and-forth affair in which the Mules came from behind twice before winning, 4-3 in overtime.</p>

<p><strong>Volleyball vs. McDaniel (Saturday, 12:00); vs. Cedar Crest (Saturday, 4:00)</strong></p>
<p>Fresh off its win against defending CC regular-season champion Franklin &amp; Marshall on Wednesday, Muhlenberg hops right back into the fire against a McDaniel team that it faced &#8211; and beat &#8211; in the CC semifinals last year.</p>
<p>The Mules (11-2) have won four in a row and lead the CC in kills per set (11.89), hitting percentage (.254), assists per set (11.09) and points per set (16.2). McDaniel (9-2), coming off a five-set loss to 13-1 Catholic, is the top blocking team in the CC, averaging 2.11 blocks per set.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg leads the all-time series, 15-8, and has won the last four meetings, including both last year.</p>
<p>The final match of the day pits Muhlenberg against 1-6 Cedar Crest. A win against McDaniel would put the Mules at 2-0 in the CC for the first time since 2002. A sweep would give them their best record (13-2) through 15 matches since 1993.</p>

<p><strong>Men&#8217;s Soccer vs. McDaniel (Saturday, 4:00)</strong></p>
<p>This is one of five games that open the 2014 CC men’s soccer season, and the early non-league results point to a highly competitive campaign ahead. CC teams have combined for an outstanding 42-12-4 (.759) record so far and occupy seven of the 10 spots in the NSCAA regional rankings released earlier this week.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg is looking to return to the playoffs after two years away, while McDaniel is seeking its first CC playoff berth since 2005.</p>
<p>The Mules (4-0-1) bring an unscored-upon streak of 428 minutes into the game; through Wednesday’s games, they were one of only nine teams in Division III to have played at least five games and allowed fewer than two goals. McDaniel (5-1) counters with the CC leader in goals and points.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg has won the last nine meetings to extend its series lead to 33-7-1, but seven of those nine games were decided by a single goal, including a 1-0 match last year in which the goal was not scored until the 72nd minute. The Green Terror’s last series win came in 2001 in the semifinals of the CC playoffs.</p>

<p><strong>Women&#8217;s Soccer vs. McDaniel (Saturday, 7:00)</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg and Bryn Mawr got the jump on the 2014 CC season last Thursday, but for the other nine teams in the league, Saturday is Opening Day. Of the five games scheduled, this is the only one featuring two teams that made the playoffs last year.</p>
<p>CC teams have done very well in non-league games, combining for a 38-19-4 (.656) record and placing five teams &#8211; including these two &#8211; in the regional top 10.</p>
<p>The first goal could win the game, as both of these teams have been very stingy. McDaniel has given up just one goal all season and Muhlenberg only two.</p>
<p>The Green Terror (5-0-1 and ranked ninth in the region) brings in a scoreless streak of 473 minutes. The Mules (5-0-1 and ranked 10th in the region) have set a school record for longest unbeaten streak to start a season and are coming off a very strong performance in a 1-1 tie against Lebanon Valley (ranked eighth in the region).</p>
<p>Muhlenberg holds a 14-6-2 series lead and has suffered only two losses to McDaniel since 1997. The teams met twice last year, with the Mules winning the regular-season meeting, 1-0. In the first round of the CC playoffs, the teams played to a scoreless draw, and Muhlenberg won the shootout to advance to the semifinals.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.muhlenberg.edu/sports/wsoclive/xlive.htm">Live stats</a> | <a href="http://portal.stretchinternet.com/muhlenberg/">Live video</a></p>
<p><strong>Football at McDaniel (Saturday, 2:00)</strong></p>
<p>There was a time when the trip to Westminster was a dreaded one for the Mules: From 1990 to 2006, they lost nine straight games there. But the last three trips have been much more fruitful: three Muhlenberg wins by a combined score of 111-6.</p>
<p>The Mules (2-0) have won eight consecutive regular-season games and came within three minutes of opening a season with back-to-back shutouts for only the second time in 66 years last week.</p>
<p>McDaniel (1-1) is a building program that improved from 0-10 in 2012 to 2-8 last year. The Green Terror opened the 2014 season with a stirring comeback win at Catholic, scoring 20 points in the final 6:35 to pull out a 34-31 win. Last week, McDaniel dropped its CC opener to Moravian, 28-7.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg has displayed the ability to produce big plays both on the ground and through the air and will try to take advantage of a McDaniel defense that allowed an average of more than 450 yards in its first two games. The Mule defense will be tested by a Green Terror passing attack that has thrown the ball 90 times for 511 yards in the first two weeks.</p>
<p>McDaniel leads the all-time series, 22-19-3.</p>

<p><strong>Cross Country at Dickinson Long/Short Invitational</strong></p>
<p>Dickinson is hosting its annual two-for-one meet, which features a 4K race for both men and women in addition to the standard distances. The meet will give the Mule teams a chance to run on the course that will be used for the NCAA Mideast Regional come November.</p>
<p><strong>Women&#8217;s Tennis at ITA Southeast Regional (Mary Washington); Women&#8217;s Golf at McDaniel Fall Invitational (Saturday)</strong></p>
<p>Both teams are traveling south, tennis to compete in the regional championships and golf to open its season.</p>

<p><strong>Men&#8217;s Lacrosse vs. York (Pa.) (Saturday, 12:00)</strong></p>
<p>Field conditions permitting, the Mules will make their home debut against a York squad coming off an overtime loss to defending national champion Stevenson. Muhlenberg opened its season with an 11-7 loss at Montclair State. The Spartans, who set a school record with 13 wins last year, are part of a grueling schedule for the Mules: their 14 opponents combined for a .607 winning percentage in 2013. York won last year&#8217;s meeting, 15-10.</p>

<p><strong>Women&#8217;s Basketball vs. Ursinus (Saturday, 2:00)</strong></p>
<p>The Mules closed out their regular season looking to take some momentum into the playoffs. For a change, they already know who and where they&#8217;ll play in the postseason: Muhlenberg (15-9, 11-6) is the fourth seed and will host fifth-seeded Gettysburg on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Ursinus (11-12, 8-9) won five in a row to put itself in contention for a playoff spot before getting eliminated with a 73-36 loss to Haverford on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Mules have won 11 straight meetings against the Bears, including a convincing 67-43 victory in Collegeville last month, part of their current stretch of nine wins in 11 games.</p>

<p><strong>Men&#8217;s Basketball vs. Ursinus (Saturday, 4:00)</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg (15-9, 10-7) has clinched a playoff berth and is locked into the 4-5 game. The Mules need a win and a Johns Hopkins loss at Washington to host the game; otherwise they will travel to Franklin &amp; Marshall, McDaniel or Johns Hopkins for their first-round clash.</p>
<p>Winless through their first 10 games of the Centennial Conference season, Ursinus (6-18, 4-13) has caught fire of late, winning four of its last seven. The Bears come into Memorial Hall on a three-game winning streak, which includes a 61-56 defeat of F&amp;M.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg won 82-66 when the teams met a month ago for its fourth straight series win. Last year, the Mules swept the Bears in a season series for the first time since 1999-2000.</p>

<p>Two Muhlenberg wrestlers are expected to travel to Ursinus to compete at the conference meet. Freshman Jaryd Flank was 4-4 in the CC in a tough 125-pound field that includes two of the top-ranked wrestlers in the country. Sophomore Che Chengsupanimit was 2-6 at 149.</p>

<p><strong>Women&#8217;s Tennis at Vassar (Saturday, 12:00)</strong></p>
<p>The Mules open their spring season against a Vassar team that was ranked 10th in the Northeast Region in the ITA preseason poll.</p>
<p><strong>Baseball at Gallaudet (Sunday, 12:00 doubleheader)</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg will get in the second half of its scheduled opening weekend four-game trip (Saturday&#8217;s twinbill at Shenandoah was rescheduled as a single game for Sunday, March 23). The forecast calls for weather in the mid-50s in Washington on Sunday &#8211; not bad at all. The Mules were 20-20 in 2013; Gallaudet, coached by former Major Leaguer Curtis Pride, went 20-21 and opened its 2014 campaign with a 14-4 win against Marymount on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Mules opened their last three seasons with doubleheader sweeps of the Bison, winning last year&#8217;s games 8-4 and 4-3.</p>

<p><strong>Field Hockey vs. Washington College (Friday, 7:00)</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg&#8217;s Homecoming was two weeks ago, but this is the field hockey team&#8217;s homecoming. The Mules (3-6, 2-2) haven&#8217;t been at home in three weeks, playing five consecutive road games.</p>
<p>Their return to Scotty Wood Stadium is for a key game. Washington (3-5, 2-1) has been to the Centennial Conference playoffs each of the last three years. The Shorewomen have won the last three games against Muhlenberg to take a 12-9 series lead.</p>

<p><strong>Volleyball vs. Washington College (Saturday, 4:00); vs. Hood (Saturday, 4:00)</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/10/vb_dig4acure.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1943" alt="Dig for a Cure" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/10/vb_dig4acure.jpg" width="600" height="214" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/10/vb_dig4acure.jpg 600w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/10/vb_dig4acure-300x107.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/10/vb_dig4acure-500x178.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a>Muhlenberg will be hosting a tri-match while Digging for a Cure: All of the Centennial Conference volleyball teams are joining forces again this year to raise money for Tanner&#8217;s Touch, a non-profit organization that raises money for pediatric cancer research. Teams are collecting pledges for each dig recorded in a preselected match.</p>
<p>The Mules&#8217; designated match is against Washington, and it&#8217;s an important one between two teams looking to reach the upper echelon of the CC. The upstart Shorewomen (12-5, 2-1) have already swept two 2012 CC playoff teams (Gettysburg and Swarthmore). With a win, Muhlenberg (9-5, 3-1) will improve to 4-1 at the midpoint of the CC season for the first time since 2001.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg leads the all-time series against Washington, 18-2. Hood, the Mules&#8217; second opponent, brings a record of 4-10.</p>

<p><strong>Football vs. Susquehanna (Saturday, 1:00)</strong></p>
<p>Last year, Muhlenberg lost at Susquehanna, 17-0, for its first shutout loss in a Centennial Conference game since 1996. The Mules hope to avoid a repeat and head into the bye week on a winning note.</p>
<p>Even though the Crusaders are winless, they were leading in the fourth quarter of one of their losses and tied in another. They have already used three starting quarterbacks this season and rolled up 544 yards of total offense at Gettysburg last week.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg (2-2, 1-2), which has scored at least 58 points in each of its two home games, will try to take advantage of a Susquehanna defense that is allowing more than 480 yards per game. The Mules lead the all-time series, 11-10.</p>

<p><strong>Women&#8217;s Soccer vs. Washington College (Saturday, 1:00)</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg is playing at home for only the third time this season, and the first in two weeks. The Mules (4-5-1, 2-1) have never lost to the Shorewomen (3-4-2, 0-2), outscoring them by a 50-3 margin in 15 meetings.</p>
<p>Live stats: <a href="http://www.muhlenberg.edu/sports/wsoclive/xlive.htm">http://www.muhlenberg.edu/sports/wsoclive/xlive.htm</a></p>
<p><strong>Men&#8217;s Soccer vs. Washington College (Saturday, 4:00)</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a very balanced season in the Centennial Conference; only a third of the way through, no team has an unblemished record and every team has at least one point. Of the 15 league games to date, only one was decided by more than one goal.</p>
<p>So even though the Mules (5-5, 1-2), coming off back-to-back games against teams ranked in the top 20 in Division III, have a 23-1-2 series lead against Washington (5-4-1, 0-2-1), expect a close game. The Shorewomen lost only 1-0 to nationally ranked Franklin &amp; Marshall and tied regionally ranked McDaniel.</p>

<p>One of the largest cross country meets in the country, the 40th Paul Short Run will include more than 6,000 runners from over 450 teams in 14 races. It will be largest field the Mules have run in this year, and it will be on the same course as their other big meet, next month&#8217;s NCAA Mideast Regional.</p>

<p>Men&#8217;s tennis wraps up its fall season with a trip to New York, while men&#8217;s golf heads south for a two-day tournament hosted by McDaniel.</p>

<p><strong>Men&#8217;s Soccer vs. Franklin &amp; Marshall (Saturday, 7:00)</strong></p>
<p>This is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> what the doctor ordered for the Mules (4-4, 0-1), who have lost three in a row and scored only one goal in their last 280 minutes. Franklin &amp; Marshall (7-0-1, 1-0) is ranked in the top 15 in both Division III polls and is one of only two teams in NCAA men&#8217;s soccer that is unscored upon this season. (The other is Division II Lander.)</p>
<p>The Diplomats lead the all-time series, 30-27-5, but the Mules have the upper hand since the start of Centennial Conference play, 13-7-2, including two postseason wins. F&amp;M&#8217;s last win in Allentown came in 2005.</p>

<p><strong>Field Hockey at Dickinson (Saturday, 11:00)</strong></p>
<p>The Mules (2-5, 1-1) are playing the fourth of five consecutive road games and will try to reverse the outcome of the first three, all of which they lost 2-1. Dickinson (5-2, 2-0) has already matched its Centennial Conference win total from a year ago, including a 1-0 defeat of 2012 CC finalist Haverford. Muhlenberg won last year&#8217;s game, 4-0, to extend its series lead to 18-12-1.</p>
<p><strong>Football at Johns Hopkins (Saturday, 2:00)</strong></p>
<p>These two teams have dominated the Centennial Conference since 2000, with Johns Hopkins going 70-24 (.745) and winning or sharing eight titles and Muhlenberg compiling a record of 66-28 (.702) with seven titles. No other CC team has a higher winning percentage than .553 during that span.</p>
<p>Hopkins (3-0, 2-0), ranked 13th by the AFCA and 16th by D3football.com, has won 23 of its last 24 CC games and is averaging 537.7 yards per game while allowing just 236.3. The only negative stat for the Blue Jays is their minus-4 turnover margin. The Mules are a CC-best plus-7.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg leads the all-time series, 23-21-1, but Johns Hopkins has won the last two meetings.</p>

<p><strong>Volleyball at Dickinson (Saturday, 2:00)</strong></p>
<p>The Mules (7-5, 1-1), coming off Wednesday&#8217;s sweep of Scranton, will try to avenge a disappointing five-set loss to the Red Devils last year. Muhlenberg leads the all-time series, 18-14, but has not won in Carlisle since 2001. Dickinson (5-8, 0-2) was swept by Haverford and Swarthmore in its first two Centennial Conference matches of the season.</p>
<p><strong>Women&#8217;s Soccer at Dickinson (Saturday, 2:00)</strong></p>
<p>One of Muhlenberg&#8217;s biggest victories last year en route to the playoffs was a 1-0 win in Carlisle. Dickinson had defeated the Mules five straight times, once in the 2009 CC semifinals. This year, Muhlenberg (3-4-1, 1-1) will try to snap a two-game losing skid against a Red Devil (4-3-2, 0-0-2) squad that has been shut out in its last three games.</p>
<p><strong>Men&#8217;s Tennis at ITA Southeast Regional (Saturday-Sunday)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Cross Country at Cedar Crest/Muhlenberg Invitational (Saturday, 10:00)<br />
</strong></p>
<p>The Mules compete in the closest thing they have to a home meet, crossing Ott Street to race for the first time in three weeks. Last year, the Muhlenberg teams swept this meet for the first time since 2008. Both Mule squads are ranked in the top 10 in the Mideast Region.</p>
<p><strong>Volleyball vs. Johns Hopkins (Saturday, 1:00)</strong></p>
<p>The two-time defending Centennial Conference champion Blue Jays kick off (or is it serve off?) the on-campus Homecoming activities. Hopkins comes in 5-4, with all of its losses coming to nationally ranked teams, while Muhlenberg is 6-4. Johns Hopkins holds a 16-5 series lead and has won 10 of the last 11 meetings.</p>
<p>Live stats: <a href="http://www.muhlenberg.edu/sports/vblive/topview.htm">http://www.muhlenberg.edu/sports/vblive/topview.htm</a></p>
<p><strong>Football vs. McDaniel (Saturday, 2:00)</strong></p>
<p>McDaniel nearly spoiled Homecoming two years ago, opening up a 26-7 lead before the Mules rallied with 27 fourth-quarter points. The Green Terror beat Moravian last weekend to snap a 13-game losing streak, while Muhlenberg is coming off a 28-21 loss at Franklin &amp; Marshall. McDaniel leads the all-time series, 22-18-3, but the Mules have won the last three meetings, rolling up a 413-168 margin in total yards in last year&#8217;s 33-0 shutout.</p>
<p>Green Terror senior running back Joe Rollins will be a player to watch, and one to tackle for the Muhlenberg defense. He rushed for 219 yards last week and is the ninth all-time leading rusher in Centennial Conference history.</p>

<p><strong>Women&#8217;s Soccer vs. Johns Hopkins (Saturday, 3:00)</strong></p>
<p>Johns Hopkins (8-0) soared to the top spot of the D3soccer.com Division III rankings after scoring road wins against then-No. 1 Messiah and then-No. 5 Carnegie Mellon. The Blue Jays are 37-4 in the Centennial Conference regular season over the last four-plus years, but three of those losses were to Muhlenberg, each time with Hopkins ranked in the top 10. The Mules (3-2-1) will look to make history repeat &#8211; again. They come in with a four-match unbeaten streak and an unscored-upon streak of 380 minutes.</p>

<p><strong>Men&#8217;s Soccer vs. Gettysburg (Saturday, 7:00)</strong></p>
<p>The last home event of Homecoming matches two teams that dominated the early days of the Centennial Conference, combining to win five of the first seven titles, but both failed to make the playoffs last year. Muhlenberg (4-2) is ranked eighth in the Mid-Atlantic Region, while Gettysburg (0-5) has lost eight straight dating back to last season. Included in the Bullets&#8217; setbacks is a 3-1 loss to Neumann, who the Mules beat. Muhlenberg holds a 35-18-6 series lead and is 8-0-1 against Gettysburg since the 2005 regular season.</p>

<p>The Mules (2-3) travel to Baltimore seeking to improve to 2-0 in the Centennial Conference for the first time in four years. Hopkins is 3-2 and opened CC play with a 4-2 win at Washington. The Blue Jays lead the series, 17-5, and have won the last three meetings.</p>

<p><strong>Volleyball hosts Buttermaker Tournament (Friday vs. Penn State Abington, 3:00; Friday vs. Neumann, 7:00; Saturday opponents TBD, 10:00 and 2:00)</strong></p>
<p>The 16<sup>th</sup> annual tournament will feature 18 matches among nine teams in a period of about 25 hours. Muhlenberg (2-2) is looking for its first Buttermaker title since 2005. Defending champion Salisbury has to be considered the favorite to repeat; the Seagulls (37-4 last year) come in ranked 22<sup>nd</sup> in the Division III preseason poll and are off to a 4-0 start. The Mules’ first two opponents have already been swept by Centennial Conference teams – Penn State Abington (0-3) by McDaniel and Neumann (1-3) by Haverford.</p>

<p><strong>Football vs. The Apprentice School (Saturday, 1:00)</strong></p>
<p>The Mules open their 112<sup>th</sup> season of football with their only non-conference game of the season. Last year, in the first meeting between the two schools, Muhlenberg fell into an early 7-0 hole before rallying to win, 27-7, en route to an 8-3 campaign that included a bid to the ECAC South Atlantic Bowl. The Builders finished up at 2-8. Both teams will feature new faces on both sides of the ball. The Mules have won six of their last seven home openers, and when their first home game has been in the afternoon, they haven’t lost since 2003.</p>

<p><strong>Men’s Soccer vs. Ithaca (Saturday, 4:00)</strong></p>
<p>The last time these two teams squared off on Varsity Field, Muhlenberg won 4-0 in a 1995 NCAA Tournament quarterfinal match, earning a trip to its only “Final Four.” The teams didn’t play again until last season, when Ithaca made an early goal stand up in a 1-0 win. The Mules (2-1) are ranked ninth in the Mid-Atlantic Region and come in with two straight shutouts. The Bombers (0-2), the defending Empire 8 co-champions, took nationally ranked Oneonta State to overtime in their season opener.</p>

<p><strong>Women’s Soccer at Gwynedd-Mercy (Saturday, 12:00) and vs. Delaware Valley (Sunday, 2:00)</strong></p>
<p>The Mules go back-to-back for the second straight weekend after losing a pair of matches to regionally ranked opponents last weekend. Last year, Muhlenberg played these teams in the opposite order, defeating Gwynedd-Mercy 1-0 in overtime a day after losing to Delaware Valley by the same score. Gwynedd is 0-2-1 to start the 2013 season, while DelVal is 1-1.</p>

			<p><em>The last time every Muhlenberg team was on the road, two weekends ago, it turned out to be a very successful day, with the Mules going 5-1 at McDaniel. How will the road trips go tomorrow? Here&#8217;s a short preview:</em></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-104" title="Mule Marquee Matchup" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1-300x203.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="203" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1-300x203.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Men&#8217;s Soccer at Haverford (Saturday, 1:00)</strong></p>
<p>The Mules (5-2, 2-1) look to bounce back from last night&#8217;s home loss to Swarthmore with a game against defending Centennial Conference runner-up Haverford (5-4, 2-1). The teams are currently tied for second place in the CC, just a point behind Swarthmore and Dickinson. Haverford&#8217;s lone CC loss was to Johns Hopkins, a team Muhlenberg beat.</p>
<p>The series has been one-sided since the start of CC play, with the Mules winning 17 of 19 meetings. The Fords&#8217; lone series win during that span came in 2001 (the 1998 game ended in a tie). Muhlenberg won 2-0 last year.</p>

<p><strong>Cross Country at Dickinson Long/Short Invitational</strong></p>
<p>It will be the biggest meet of the season to date for both Mule teams, who took first place at Cedar Crest last week. The women, ranked seventh in the region, will compete against two of the teams ranked ahead of them – Dickinson (2) and Elizabethtown (6).</p>

<p><strong>Field Hockey at Dickinson (Saturday, 11:00)</strong></p>
<p>Both of these teams were 5-12 last year. The Mules (5-3, 1-2) have already matched their 2011 win total, and the Red Devils (4-5, 0-3) are just one away. All five of Muhlenberg&#8217;s wins are by one goal, two in overtime, and Dickinson has played a pair of overtime games. Last year the teams played a wild game that came down to the final seconds, with the Mules holding on for a 4-3 win.</p>
<p><strong>Volleyball at Dickinson (Saturday, 11:30)</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg (8-5, 1-2) is looking to get back on the winning track after dropping back-to-back CC matches to Haverford and Johns Hopkins last week. Dickinson (1-11, 0-3) has lost seven straight. The Mules have not won in Carlisle since 2001 but took last year&#8217;s meeting at home, 3-1. </p>
<p><strong>Football at Susquehanna (Saturday, 1:00)</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg (3-1, 2-1) looks to bounce back from its first loss of the season, last week to Johns Hopkins, against a Susquehanna team that, although winless in the Centennial Conference, is still dangerous. The Crusaders (1-3, 0-3) led undefeated Gettysburg in the fourth quarter last week and lead the CC with a plus-8 turnover margin. The Mules are plus-5 themselves and have not turned the ball over in their last 10 quarters.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg leads the series, 11-9, and has won both meetings since Susquehanna joined the CC for football. The Mules travel well, especially on defense &#8211; they&#8217;ve allowed one touchdown or fewer in five of their last eight road games.</p>

<p><strong>Women&#8217;s Soccer at Dickinson, 5:00</strong></p>
<p>This will be Muhlenberg&#8217;s fifth game against an opponent ranked in the top 10 in the region. The Mules (3-6-1, 1-2) beat Johns Hopkins (3t), lost to Messiah (1) by three and suffered one-goal losses to Haverford (3t) and Wilkes (9t). Dickinson (6-2, 1-1), ranked sixth in the region, also lost 1-0 to Haverford and is coming off a 2-0 loss to Messiah. The Red Devils have won the last five series meetings, the last two by a final of 1-0.</p>

			<p>Muhlenberg welcomes five Johns Hopkins teams for some key games on Homecoming Weekend. Plus, the cross country teams have a race just a few blocks from campus.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-104" title="Mule Marquee Matchup" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="237" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg 350w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1-300x203.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" /></a>Football vs. Johns Hopkins (Saturday, 2:00)</strong></p>
<p>Johns Hopkins vs. Muhlenberg is always one of the big games in Centennial Conference football, and this year is no exception. Both teams have dominated their first three opponents, the Blue Jays outscoring them 119-35 and the Mules 81-7.</p>
<p>Hopkins, ranked 16th in one Division III poll and 24th in another, brings in a regular-season winning streak of 17 games. Muhlenberg has won six straight at home, the last three by shutout.</p>
<p>The Mules are the only Division III team to have played three games this season and allowed no more than one touchdown. (In all NCAA divisions, the only other schools to do that are Division II Indiana (Pa.) and FBS Florida State.) They&#8217;ll be challenged to keep that streak alive against a Blue Jay offense that averages nearly 500 yards per game.</p>
<p>The winner of this game has gone on to play in the NCAA Tournament every year but one since 2001.</p>

<p><strong>Field Hockey vs. Johns Hopkins (Friday, 7:00)</strong></p>
<p>Two teams coming off losses to nationally ranked opponents look to get back on the winning track. The Mules (4-2, 1-1) fell to No. 12 Haverford, 2-0, on Wednesday, while the Blue Jays (3-3, 0-1) lost to No. 1 New Jersey, 5-1, on Sunday. Hopkins also dropped its CC opener to Washington, 2-1 in overtime.</p>
<p>The Blue Jays lead the all-time series, 16-5, but Muhlenberg&#8217;s last two wins came in 2008 and 2009 when Hopkins was ranked in the top 10 in Division.III.</p>

<p><strong>Volleyball vs. Johns Hopkins (Friday, 7:00)</strong></p>
<p>The young Muhlenberg (8-4, 1-1) team will face a challenge in a Hopkins squad that has won 26 consecutive regular-season matches and is receiving votes in the national Division III poll. </p>

<p><strong>Cross Country at Falcon Classic (Saturday, 10:00)</strong></p>
<p>The Muhlenberg teams compete for the first time in three weeks at a meet in which they have had success. One or both Mule squads took first place the last three times they&#8217;ve run in this meet, including the men last year.</p>
<p><strong>Women&#8217;s Soccer vs. Johns Hopkins (Saturday, 3:00)</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg looks to avoid going to 0-3 in the CC against a Johns Hopkins team that is ranked sixth in Division III and has won 14 straight CC games. The last loss before that streak started was in the last meeting in Allentown; the Mules beat Blue Jay teams ranked in the top 10 in both 2009 and 2010.</p>

<p><strong>Men&#8217;s Soccer vs. Johns Hopkins (Saturday, 7:00)</strong></p>
<p>The Homecoming Weekend athletic slate concludes with what is always an entertaining matchup. The Mules (4-1, 1-0) and Blue Jays (3-3, 1-0) have combined for 13 championships in the CC&#8217;s 19-year history. Muhlenberg, ranked seventh in the Mid-Atlantic Region, is winless (0-5-2) against Hopkins since 2005, although only one of those games was decided by more than one goal.</p>
