			<p>Nick Gazzillo has gone through a cold stretch or two during his many years playing baseball. None of them, however, could compare to what Muhlenberg&#8217;s senior outfielder experienced recently.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/02/photo-4.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2185" alt="Polar Bear Plunge" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/02/photo-4.jpg" width="320" height="240" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/02/photo-4.jpg 320w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/02/photo-4-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /></a>Gazzillo and 11 of his Mule teammates took part in a polar bear plunge at Scott Park in Easton, braving the frigid waters of the Lehigh River on a chilly Saturday morning.</p>
<p>“We all just ran into the river,” Gazzillo recounted. “Most of us, like myself, ran out as soon as we dunked our heads in. Some brave &#8211; and stupid &#8211; guys swam all the way out to the safety boat. There are no words to describe how cold it really is. It’s not as bad going in as going out. It is really more shocking than anything when you go in, but coming out your muscles tense up and it becomes hard to move. It’s overwhelming and exciting at the same time.”</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/02/IMG_0727.mov">Polar Bear Plunge movie</a></p>
<p>The reason Gazzillo and his teammates were there certainly helped to warm them up.</p>
<p>The event was held to benefit Special Olympics Pennsylvania, for which the Muhlenberg baseball squad raised more than $2,000. Each plunger was responsible for $50 in order to participate, so the Mules created a team web page to facilitate online donations. One player – freshman Jakob Cayne, managed to raise $1,650 himself, a huge boost to the thousands of athletes who take part in Special Olympics events around the commonwealth.</p>
<p>“We worked together and advertised it to our team as a way to help those who don&#8217;t get the same opportunity we do,” Gazzillo said. “We get to play 40 games a year, compete, have fans watch us and feel something special that every athlete feels. The guys really responded to this and we had a lot of people who wanted to help and jump in. Giving others who don&#8217;t have the same physical capabilities as us a chance to do the same feels great.”</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/02/photo-1.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2184" alt="Polar Bear Plunge" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/02/photo-1.jpg" width="320" height="276" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/02/photo-1.jpg 320w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/02/photo-1-300x258.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /></a>Gazzillo, a member of the Student-Athlete Advisory Committee (SAAC), took the plunge last year with two other baseball players. This year, with more time to plan, Gazzillo and his SAAC mates made the event bigger. In addition to the 12 players who dove into the icy waters, 10 of their Mule teammates came out in support, along with other members of the school’s athletic department.</p>
<p>Though Gazzillo won’t be around to organize the plunge a year from now, he is confident that participation will only continue to grow.</p>
<p>“We want to have as many people do it as we can,” Gazzillo said. “It’s such an important cause, and even though I won’t be there next year, I know my teammates are going to do a great job with it.”</p>
<p>With field hockey coach and SAAC advisor Megan Eddinger and teammate Matthew Lawsky, a fellow SAAC member, around to take the reins next year, the Mules’ future plungers are in good hands.</p>
<p>“I really can’t say enough about the effort that Coach Eddinger and Matt Lawsky put in. After doing it last year I – along with Nick Kennedy and Matt Clarke – know this is something we can do for years to come.”</p>

			<p>The Muhlenberg women&#8217;s basketball team paid tribute to the many former players who returned to Memorial Hall yesterday by hosting a post-alumnae game reception. And by playing a one-point game against McDaniel.</p>
<p>The thrilling 60-59 win added another chapter to a remarkable rivalry that has included eight one-point games in the last 13 years.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s eight one-point games in 30 meetings with the Green Terror. Over the same stretch, the Mules have played a total of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">six</span> one-point games in 315 meetings with all other opponents.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a rundown of those nailbiters:</p>
<ul>
<li>2001-02 Western Maryland 83, Muhlenberg 82 (ot)</li>
<li>2001-02 Western Maryland 53, Muhlenberg 52 &#8211; Centennial Conference semifinal</li>
<li>2002-03 Muhlenberg 63, McDaniel 62</li>
<li>2005-06 Muhlenberg 65, McDaniel 64</li>
<li>2005-06 Muhlenberg 56, McDaniel 55 (ot) &#8211; Centennial Conference semifinal</li>
<li>2008-09 Muhlenberg 77, McDaniel 76 (ot)</li>
<li>2009-10 McDaniel 72, Muhlenberg 71 (ot)</li>
<li>2013-14 Muhlenberg 60, McDaniel 59</li>
</ul>
<p>Not making the list was another overtime game, won by McDaniel by a relatively comfortable margin of three points in 2003-04. In the Mules&#8217; CC championship season of 2005-06, they defeated the Green Terror three times by a total of five points.</p>
<p>Incredibly, yesterday&#8217;s game was the fourth of the eight decided on free throws with fewer than 5 seconds remaining. In 2002-03, Muhlenberg&#8217;s Lindsay Tis made a pair of winning free throws with 3 seconds to play. In 2008-09, Alexis Bates sank a pair with 2.1 showing as the Mules escaped one of few close calls they had in their undefeated CC season.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/02/laney_freethrow.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2176" alt="Erin Laney free throw" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/02/laney_freethrow.jpg" width="350" height="316" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/02/laney_freethrow.jpg 350w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/02/laney_freethrow-300x270.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/02/laney_freethrow-332x300.jpg 332w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" /></a>McDaniel&#8217;s win the following season came on two free throws with 2.5 seconds to play. Yesterday, Erin Laney made the second of two foul shots for the winning point with 0.8 showing on the clock. In the screen cap at left, Laney&#8217;s shot goes through the basket as the anxious Mule men&#8217;s team looks on.</p>
<p>The two teams had gotten away from their thrilling games the last few years as McDaniel went through a rebuilding phase. Muhlenberg won all six meetings between 2010-11 and 2012-13 by an average of 16 points.</p>
<p>But McDaniel is back near the top of the CC standings, where it resided for most of the last decade. After yesterday&#8217;s game, the Green Terror and Mules are tied for third place in the CC with identical 9-4 records. Only three weeks remain in the regular season, and both teams are in good position to make the playoffs. If they do, the current Mules could join their predecessors who played McDaniel in the postseason eight times.</p>
<p>And if that happens, there&#8217;s a good chance it will be yet another one-point game. <a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/02/DSC_4820.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2178" alt="DSC_4820" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/02/DSC_4820-1024x479.jpg" width="584" height="273" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/02/DSC_4820-1024x479.jpg 1024w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/02/DSC_4820-300x140.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/02/DSC_4820-500x233.jpg 500w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/02/DSC_4820.jpg 1323w" sizes="(max-width: 584px) 100vw, 584px" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Women&#8217;s Basketball vs. McDaniel (Saturday, 2:00)</strong></p>
<p>It will be just like old times for these two teams. From 2004, when the Centennial Conference went to one division, to 2010, a McDaniel-Muhlenberg matchup in February usually had great playoff implications. Both teams qualified for the CC playoffs in six of those seven years, and they met in the playoffs four times.</p>
<p>The Green Terror (14-4, 9-3) finished under .500 in the CC in each of the last three years, but now it is back in a big way, tied in the loss column for second place. The Mules (11-7, 8-4) are just a game back, and as the playoff teams start to separate themselves out, games like this one are huge.</p>
<p>McDaniel comes in with a six-game winning streak that includes back-to-back 70-41 blowouts of Johns Hopkins and Washington. Muhlenberg has won six of seven since suffering a 52-45 loss at McDaniel in early January.</p>
<p>It could be another low-scoring game. McDaniel is second in the CC in scoring defense (51.7 points per game) and leads the league in steals per game, turnover margin and three-point field-goal defense. Muhlenberg, meanwhile, has allowed opponents to shoot just 30.8 percent from the field (24.5 percent from three-point range) and average only51.1 points over its last eight games.</p>

<p><strong>Men&#8217;s Basketball vs. McDaniel (Saturday, 4:00)</strong></p>
<p>Four days after defeating first-place Dickinson, Muhlenberg returns home to face <em>another</em> first-place team in McDaniel. The Mules&#8217; first home game in two weeks matches the hottest team in the Centennial Conference against the hottest scorer in the CC and the league’s top defense against its second-best offense.</p>
<p>The Green Terror (14-4, 9-2) is tied for first place in the CC and has won seven straight games. It entered the week ranked ninth in Division III in scoring defense, allowing only 60.2 points per game. The Mules (12-6, 7-4) are tied for fourth place with Johns Hopkins.</p>
<p>Defense won out when the two teams met in Maryland in early January. The Mules scored 30 points in the first 13:34 in opening up a 15-point lead but managed only 20 points the rest of the way as the Green Terror came back for a 57-50 win. Muhlenberg has won 14 of the last 16 series meetings in Memorial Hall.</p>
<p>Junior guard Malique Killing scored 38, 33 and 35 points in the Mules&#8217; three road games, becoming only the second player in CC history to record three straight 30-point games. The seventh-leading scorer in Division III at the start of the week, he needs just 26 more points to set the CC record for points scored in the freshman, sophomore and junior years.</p>

<p><strong>Indoor Track &amp; Field at Lehigh&#8217;s John Covert Classic (Saturday, 10:00)</strong></p>
<p>The indoor season is moving allowing rapidly for the Mule teams: this is only their third meet of the season, yet they&#8217;re just one month away from the CC Championships. They will get to compete against Division I athletes for the first time this season at Lehigh.</p>
<p><strong>Wrestling at Gettysburg with New York University (Saturday, 1:00)</strong></p>
<p>The shorthanded Mules wrestling team travels to Gettysburg to compete in its second straight CC trimatch.</p>

</em></p>
<p><strong>Indoor Track &amp; Field hosts Muhlenberg Invitational (Friday, 3:00)<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg welcomes DeSales, Goucher, Neumann and Wesley for its only home indoor meet of the season. Last year, Muhlenberg athletes won 12 of the 26 events. Field events begin at 3:00, running events at 6:00.</p>
<p><strong>Wrestling vs. McDaniel and Stevens (Saturday, 12:00)<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg opens its Centennial Conference dual meet season with the first of its two scheduled home tri-matches. The Mules take on McDaniel in the first match and Stevens in the third. Both McDaniel (at 133) and Stevens (at 149) bring in nationally ranked wrestlers. Coming off his impressive win at Ursinus&#8217; Will Abele Invitational last weekend, Mule freshman Jaryd Flank will make his home debut &#8211; although since McDaniel does not have anyone at 125, his first appearance probably will be a brief one to get his hand raised.</p>
<p><a title="Athletes of the Week – January 13-19, 2014" href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/2014/01/21/athletes-of-the-week-january-13-19-2014/">live video</a></p>
<p><strong>Men&#8217;s Basketball at Johns Hopkins (Saturday, 1:00)</strong></p>
<p>Two teams that were defeated in the Centennial Conference semifinals last year meet for the second time this season, with Muhlenberg looking to complete its fourth season sweep of Johns Hopkins in the last six years.</p>
<p>In the first meeting this season, the Mules saw their 16-point halftime lead pared to three but shot 60 percent in the second half to hold on for a 91-75 win.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg (11-5, 6-3) and Johns Hopkins (9-7, 6-3) are currently tied for fourth place in the CC, a game behind second-place McDaniel and Franklin &amp; Marshall and two in front of sixth-place Gettysburg. The Mules have won three of their last four following a three-game losing streak, while the Blue Jays have rebounded from a four-game skid by winning five of their last six.</p>
<p>A win would push Muhlenberg to 7-3 in the CC for just the second time in the last 12 years.</p>

<p><strong>Women&#8217;s Basketball vs. Johns Hopkins (Saturday, 3:00)</strong></p>
<p>The two most successful programs in CC history meet for the second time this season, with the Mules (9-7, 6-4) looking to continue their hot streak against the first-place Blue Jays (12-3, 10-0).</p>
<p>Muhlenberg has won four of its last five, including Wednesday&#8217;s decisive 67-43 win at Ursinus. Hopkins had a much tougher time at Ursinus last Saturday, needing a late rally to win 71-67. Dating back to last season, the Blue Jays have won 21 of their last 23 CC regular-season games.</p>
<p>Hopkins scored 14 of the game’s first 17 points and nine of the last 12 to edge the Mules, 65-58, in a back-and-forth battle in the first meeting this season.</p>
<p>The Blue Jays hold a 24-18 all-time lead in a series that includes 11 postseason meetings. Muhlenberg has won a game in Baltimore in each of the last three seasons, last year in the regular season and in the 2011 and 2012 CC championship games.</p>

			<p>If Maggie Zerbe gets to lift a Centennial Conference championship trophy in a couple of months, it still might not measure up to the last piece of hardware she held in her hands. And if the freshman on the Muhlenberg women’s basketball team ever feels those pregame jitters, she’ll have advice taken firsthand from a legend to guide her.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, Zerbe had the chance to meet Teresa Edwards, a Hall of Famer and four-time gold medalist with the United States national team. Edwards was in town to speak at a banquet in advance of an annual Lehigh Valley high school tournament &#8211; one that Zerbe, a Bethlehem native, attended several times &#8211; and when Mules head coach Ron Rohn texted the team to see if anyone was interested in having lunch with her, Zerbe jumped at the chance. Though Zerbe wasn’t fully aware of Edwards’ resume, the freshman came away fully impressed.</p>
<p>“I didn’t know anything about her,” Zerbe said. “Coach told me she was a five-time Olympian, though. She was pretty cool.”</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/12/zerbe_edwards.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2155" alt="Maggie Zerbe, Teresa Edwards, Jack McCallum" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/12/zerbe_edwards.jpg" width="450" height="278" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/12/zerbe_edwards.jpg 450w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/12/zerbe_edwards-300x185.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a>Accompanied by Rohn and Muhlenberg professor Jack McCallum, who chronicled professional basketball for three decades at <i>Sports Illustrated </i>and arranged the meeting, Zerbe listened intently at a restaurant in Bethlehem as Edwards regaled her, as well as players from Moravian and DeSales, with stories of her playing and coaching career.</p>
<p>“It was definitely interesting meeting her,” Zerbe said. “She talked a lot about playing overseas and in the Olympics. She played in five Olympics, so it was cool hearing about all the coaches she had – [Legendary Tennessee coach] Pat Summitt, [Stanford’s] Tara VanDerveer. It was amazing hearing about her experiences.”</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/12/teresa_edwards.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2153" alt="Teresa Edwards" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/12/teresa_edwards.jpg" width="286" height="363" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/12/teresa_edwards.jpg 286w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/12/teresa_edwards-236x300.jpg 236w" sizes="(max-width: 286px) 100vw, 286px" /></a>In addition to winning gold with the American national team in 1984 (Los Angeles), 1988 (Seoul), 1996 (Barcelona) and 2000 (Sydney), Edwards is one of just three basketball players to have played in five Olympics. She also holds the unique distinction of being the youngest women’s gold medalist (age 20 in 1984) and the oldest gold medalist (36 in 2000).</p>
<p>“Players now probably think women’s basketball only goes back to UConn and Rebecca Lobo,” Rohn said. “They don’t necessarily have an appreciation of the history of the game. For Maggie to have a chance to meet Teresa and hear about her experiences was a great thing.”</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/12/zerbe.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2154" alt="Maggie Zerbe" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/12/zerbe.jpg" width="250" height="499" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/12/zerbe.jpg 250w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/12/zerbe-150x300.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px" /></a>Zerbe, who has played in seven games for the Mules this season, says she often feels nervous before games. As a freshman, she’s still adjusting to the college game and her new surroundings. So hearing Edwards, who played in her first Olympic Games as a collegian at Georgia, describe going through the same experiences was certainly reassuring.</p>
<p>“She said to just remember you belong there,” Zerbe said. “Have confidence in yourself, because that’s the one thing no one can take away from you. She said she had to pay her dues, going into a program in college and then at the Olympics.</p>
<p>“It definitely helps. Feeling that other people have gone through the things you have to, it’s something you can use. To know that she had experienced the same things I’ve been experiencing was nice to hear.”</p>
<p>Edwards, who played overseas for nine years after graduating from the University of Georgia and was named the 1996 Sportswoman of the Year by the Women’s Sports Foundation, predictably had no shortage of fascinating anecdotes.</p>
<p>There was the one about Summitt – “Pat would give her ‘the look’ if she made a mistake,” Zerbe said. There were many about the Games themselves, and what it felt like to win a gold medal – or four. The ones that piqued Zerbe’s interest, however, were the ones about her years in Spain, France, Italy and Venezuela, and the international celebrity she gained from her accomplishments.</p>
<p>“The stories that stuck out for me were about when she played overseas,” Zerbe recalled. “You were a celebrity over there. Even earlier on when she first started playing, she would walk outside and people would come up to her and ask for her autograph. It was so interesting to hear how different it was than here in America.”</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/12/zerbe_goldmedal.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2156" alt="Maggie Zerbe" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/12/zerbe_goldmedal.jpg" width="400" height="389" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/12/zerbe_goldmedal.jpg 400w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/12/zerbe_goldmedal-300x291.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/12/zerbe_goldmedal-308x300.jpg 308w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></a>At the end of the meal and an hour and a half of stories, Zerbe got to try on Edwards’ last gold medal, the one she earned at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney.</p>
<p>“It was really cool,” Zerbe said. “It was pretty heavy, even more than I thought it would be. It was definitely a very cool experience that I’ll remember for a long time.”</p>
<p>Now, Zerbe and the Mules would love some hardware of their own.</p>

			<p><em>The Muhlenberg softball team recently participated in a pair of community service projects. Junior outfielder Alyssa Schell fills us in:</em></p>
<p><em></em>If you were awake at 8:00am on a recent Sunday morning, you might have seen the softball team convening outside in the ML parking lot. We were all gathering with plans to head over to the 6<sup>th</sup> Street Shelter in Allentown.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/12/softbig_MB121813.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2140" alt="softball at 6th Street Shelter" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/12/softbig_MB121813.jpg" width="780" height="444" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/12/softbig_MB121813.jpg 780w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/12/softbig_MB121813-300x170.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/12/softbig_MB121813-500x284.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" /></a></p>
<p>The 6<sup>th</sup> Street Shelter is a shelter that specializes in family living. The shelter is unique in doing just that. Instead of dormitory style living, the shelter offers suite style apartments to keep families together during hard times. The hard facts are that 38 percent of those homeless in the Lehigh Valley are children. The shelter combats the dispersing of families and helps set up employment and financial planning for the families that go through the shelter.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/12/sheltercleanup1.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2137" alt="shelter cleanup" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/12/sheltercleanup1-300x201.jpg" width="300" height="201" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/12/sheltercleanup1-300x201.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/12/sheltercleanup1.jpg 425w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>The team helped clean the property around the shelter. We raked and swept up leaves, cleaned up trash that blew in from that week’s heavy wind, cleaned up the shelter’s playground, pulled weeds and even cleared off a fence covered with dead poison ivy. The team tackled this large task by splitting into groups of twos, where each group focused on a separate section of the perimeter of the shelter.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/12/sheltercleanup3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2139" alt="shelter cleanup" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/12/sheltercleanup3.jpg" width="500" height="248" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/12/sheltercleanup3.jpg 500w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/12/sheltercleanup3-300x148.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/12/sheltercleanup2.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2138" alt="shelter cleanup" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/12/sheltercleanup2-253x300.jpg" width="253" height="300" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/12/sheltercleanup2-253x300.jpg 253w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/12/sheltercleanup2.jpg 315w" sizes="(max-width: 253px) 100vw, 253px" /></a>Having all my team members rallying together in order to make a difference in the appearance of the shelter was truly heartwarming. Even though raking leaves can seem like something minimal, you could tell that the small deed goes a long way in helping the confidence of the residents at the shelter.</p>
<p>By the end, team members were asking the employees how we could further help the shelter. The shelter does not typically take clothing donations because of the lack of space. However, the shelter does take donations of cleaning supplies and still needs volunteers. If you are interested in volunteering or even learning more about the 6<sup>th</sup> Street Shelter, go to <a href="http://www2.caclv.org">http://www2.caclv.org</a>.</p>
<p>That Thursday, members of the team assembled and made the trek to Roosevelt Elementary School to participate in their annual Book Blast. One Thursday a month, students and their parents listen to stories and participate in crafts relating to a particular theme. The theme that our team participated was “America and Your Country.”</p>
<p>Our team read and helped with crafts in which the students created their own country where they had to decide their name, national bird, capital, etc. At the end, there was a raffle to determine the student who could take the book we read home.</p>
<p>The team’s combined effort to make an enjoyable experience for these young students was wonderful. Our team was split up again in separate classrooms and I found it very inspiring that in my classroom, the parents were talking to their first- graders and pointing at me saying that one day, if they worked hard enough they could go to college like me. I found that being in the classroom as a college student gave the kids something to strive for.</p>
<p>I know that many volunteers have helped me get to where I am today, and I am glad to give back and possibly help a child progress in their life like someone has done for me.</p>

			<p>The weather outside was frightful. But inside Billera Hall, the second half of yesterday&#8217;s doubleheader against DeSales was a delight for Muhlenberg basketball fans.</p>
<p>The Mule men&#8217;s team led from start to finish in an 83-64 win that included several noteworthy accomplishments:</p>
<p><strong>Muhlenberg improved its record to 7-1.</strong> It&#8217;s only the 10th time in the history of a program that began in 1900 that the Mules have at least seven wins through their first eight games &#8211; and only the third time in the last 58 years. Most of the first nine teams to get off to such fast starts had memorable seasons.</p>
<ul>
<li>1929 started 7-1, finished 9-4</li>
<li>1935 started 11-1, finished 14-5</li>
<li>1943-44 started 10-1, finished 20-5 and played in NIT</li>
<li>1944-45 started 11-0, finished 24-4 and played in NIT</li>
<li>1945-46 started 16-1, finished 23-5 and played in NIT</li>
<li>1947-48 started 9-1, finished 21-4 and won MAC championship</li>
<li>1955-56 started 8-0, finished 15-10</li>
<li>1968-69 started 7-1, finished 19-6 and won MAC South championship</li>
<li>1984-85 started 7-1, finished 19-7 and won MAC Southwest</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Muhlenberg won the unofficial &#8220;LVIII&#8221; championship.</strong> For the first time since the 2005-06 season, the Mules defeated both Division III Lehigh Valley rivals, Moravian and DeSales. The Mules won both games by 19 points on the road &#8211; it was the first time in 35 years that they knocked off Moravian and DeSales on their home courts in the same season.</p>
<p><strong>The Mules handed DeSales their worst home loss in eight years.</strong> The Bulldogs suffered an 80-58 loss to King&#8217;s late in the 2005-06 season. They started a 23-game home winning streak the following year and have remained hard to beat on their home court. Muhlenberg hadn&#8217;t won at Billera Hall since the 2000-01 season and hadn&#8217;t won there by more than 15 points since the 1986-87 year.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/12/hargrove_desales.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2132" alt="Kevin Hargrove" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/12/hargrove_desales.jpg" width="350" height="384" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/12/hargrove_desales.jpg 350w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/12/hargrove_desales-273x300.jpg 273w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" /></a>Muhlenberg made foul shots.</strong> This is not as noteworthy an accomplishment, since the Mules have been taking their free points all season. Muhlenberg was 22-for-25 from the line, improving its season percentage &#8211; which ranked eighth in Division III at the start of the week &#8211; to .813. Over the last five games, the Mules are 111-for-130 (.854) on free throws.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Hargrove reached a milestone.</strong> The senior center <em>(pictured)</em> blocked two shots to bring his career total to an even 200. Already the Mules&#8217; career leader, Hargrove is the fourth player in Centennial Conference history to record 200 blocked shots. He needs 12 more swats to move into third place on the CC&#8217;s all-time list.</p>
<p><strong>The Mules were stingy on defense.</strong> Hargrove is the centerpiece of a defense that held DeSales, which had scored 80 and 81 points in its last two games, to a season-low 64 points on 32.1-percent shooting. The Mules entered the week 13th in Division III in field-goal percentage defense and lowered their mark to .363. In Muhlenberg&#8217;s seven wins, opponents have shot just 34.2 percent.</p>

Plus, wrestling hits the mats for the first time in three weeks.</em></p>
<p><strong>Wrestling at Messiah Petrofes Invitational (Friday and Saturday)</strong></p>
<p>This will be the 27th consecutive year for Muhlenberg competing in this tournament, which was formerly hosted by Lebanon Valley. The Mules are sending six wrestlers to what usually is a very competitive field.</p>
<p><strong>Women&#8217;s Basketball vs. Johns Hopkins (Saturday, 12:00)</strong></p>
<p>Johns Hopkins vs. Muhlenberg is a rivalry unlike any other in Centennial Conference women&#8217;s basketball. Games between the two teams are frequently memorable and almost always important, since the programs are by far the top two in the league’s history. Since the formation of the CC in 1993, Hopkins has a 265-67 (.798) record in league games, and Muhlenberg is 255-84 (.752). No other team has more than 209 wins or a winning percentage higher than .633.</p>
<p>Hopkins (6-2, 5-0) has jumped to the early lead in the CC race (along with undefeated Haverford), while Muhlenberg (4-2, 2-1) has lost two straight close games to teams receiving votes in the D3hoops.com poll.</p>
<p>Expect some points to be put on the board. Muhlenberg and Johns Hopkins are first and second, respectively, in the CC in points scored per game and last and third-from-last, respectively, in points allowed per game. The average score (rounded) of the eight CC games involving one of these two teams is 74-65. The average score of the other 11 CC games this year? 55-46.</p>
<p>The Blue Jays hold a 23-18 all-time lead in a series that includes 11 postseason meetings. Last year the teams split, with the visitor prevailing each time.</p>

<p><strong>Men&#8217;s Basketball vs. Johns Hopkins (Saturday, 2:00)</strong></p>
<p>Johns Hopkins has been a thorn in Muhlenberg’s side ever since the formation of the CC in 1993. The Mules are 9-25 against the Blue Jays in CC regular-season and playoff games, and only three of those nine wins have come at home. Hopkins leads the all-time series, 35-15, and swept last year’s meetings, 76-74 and 63-59.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg (5-1, 2-1) and Hopkins (4-4, 2-1) were picked third and fourth, respectively, in the CC preseason poll, and one will keep pace with Dickinson, the only 3-0 team, heading into the holiday break.</p>
<p>The Blue Jays are coming off a home loss to Gettysburg, while the Mules won at Swarthmore, 64-48, in their first post-Thanksgiving game. It was the 16th time Muhlenberg held an opponent under 50 points in a CC regular-season game, and it was another fine defensive effort for the Mules, who are holding their opponents to 36.4-percent shooting (33.6 percent in their five wins). Those percentages drop to .263 and .190 for three-pointers; Hopkins has made more three-pointers (57) than any other CC team.</p>
<p>A win would give the Mules their second 6-1 start in three years; before 2011 they hadn’t been 6-1 since 1988.</p>

			<p>For the past four years, Carolyn Dorf and her fellow sprinters on the Muhlenberg track and field team have used their speed to break school records, earn spots in the top 10 on the all-time performance list and score points at championship meets.</p>
<p>Recently, Dorf’s quickness accomplished something much more important.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/dorf.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2119" alt="Carolyn Dorf" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/dorf.jpg" width="350" height="367" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/dorf.jpg 350w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/dorf-286x300.jpg 286w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" /></a>On Friday, November 15, Dorf and her teammates were eating dinner in the Wood Dining Commons after practice. “Everyone was in their own conversations – it was all very normal,” she recalled.</p>
<p>That was until a teammate sitting diagonally from Dorf looked up at her. His eyes were red, and he had his hands crossed around his neck – the universal choking sign.</p>
<p>Dorf immediately jumped up, ran around the table, and gave a few abdominal thrusts. Her teammate spit out the food that was preventing him from breathing, and Dorf followed up with some pats on his back.</p>
<p>“He was totally fine. He actually finished his plate,” said Dorf. “I was a little shaken because I never had to do that before.</p>
<p>“It all happened in about 10 seconds. It was crazy. Afterwards everyone was like, wait, what just happened?”</p>
<p>Fellow senior Nicole Pisani was sitting to Dorf’s left but had her head turned when the whole thing started. “It really amazed me how quickly she got over there. I was sitting right next to Carolyn and when I looked she was already gone,” she said. “She jumped without any hesitation.”</p>
<p>Dorf has been a certified lifeguard since she was 15 and is trained in the use of the Heimlich Maneuver. It was ironic that she was called on to perform it not at a pool or beach, but while sitting down to dinner at school.</p>
<p>“I think I’m most proud that I was able to act accordingly,” said Dorf. “That was always my biggest fear, that when the time came I wouldn’t be able to stay cool, calm and collected – because I’m usually not.</p>
<p>“I was just doing what I was trained to do,” she added. “It’s nice to be recognized, but I felt like anyone would have done the same. I was just happy I could help him.”</p>
<p>Although Dorf remains modest about the incident, her teammates are having none of that. They were still buzzing about it the following day at Lehigh when they went to cheer the cross country team at the NCAA Mideast Regional.</p>
<p>“We all wanted to help but she was the one who took the initiative,” said Pisani. “Right after it happened, we were all like, Carolyn, you’re our hero!”</p>
