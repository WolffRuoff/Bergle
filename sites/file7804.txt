								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">                          The article, <em>Fashion in the Age of Advertising</em>, talks about the progression of fashion through advancements in technology and how our views and perceptions have changed. Being “trendy” or wearing popular clothes is instigated by the common use of technology. Using the internet allows people to constantly see what others are wearing and how they are doing their makeup. As soon as New York Fashion Week happens, people are flocking to the stores to get the styles that were worn in the show as they have seen pictures posted online. However, this also instigates the need for material items. When people see that hunter rain boots are in style, they feel the need to spend $100 plus dollars on them to fit in. When picking out clothing in the morning, you  strategically plan out how you want to look to the world. However, the nature of advertising online has changed the access people have to the information regarding the latest styles. Therefore people are more concerned with keeping up with the latest trends than expressing their personality through their style. In </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Fashion in the Age of Advertising</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, Martin states, “The consumer desire for fashion and beauty is one that can be compelled to fast fulfillment and vast urgings.” (1995) With the constantly changing trends and easy access to these changes allows consumers to constantly buy the latest and greatest products. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">                            I know I personally fall victim to online advertisements. As soon as I see an ad for a cute pair of boots, my immediate reaction is go google search those boots. Societal norms makes us want to fit in because we feel as though we are an insider. Therefore, buying the latest trends gives us the satisfaction of fitting in with the norms of society. We can be just like everybody else and for a teenager that is all we want. Many people use the saying sometimes fashion is painful. This rings true in many sense. People are no longer wearing clothing for purely function, it is also about fitting in and looking “cool”. Wearing five inch heels are not very comfortable; however, society tells us that is what we need to wear to be “normal.”It is hard to keep up with the latest trends as it is very costly. Therefore, many times advertisements leave us yearning for material items that often  we don&#8217;t need.  Seeing other people with these items like our friends or celebrities on the T.V. makes us jealous and gives the feeling that we need these items. Will fashion change directions or will the norms they advertise become less and less achievable for the average person? </span></p>
