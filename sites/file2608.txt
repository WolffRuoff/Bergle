<p>Albiniak.P (2011 March 14) Selling the Glee: Twentieth Television turns its attention to pitching its hit to stations for 2013 <em>Broadcasting and Cable </em>retrived from:<a href="http://0-web.ebscohost.com.library.muhlenberg.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=01ff61a1-db46-49b8-b3ca-e777fb23c69a%40sessionmgr10&amp;vid=7&amp;hid=15">http://0-web.ebscohost.com.library.muhlenberg.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=01ff61a1-db46-49b8-b3ca-e777fb23c69a%40sessionmgr10&amp;vid=7&amp;hid=15</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whether it’s on magazine covers or red carpet shows, the stars of Glee seem to be everywhere.  But Twentieth Television, which produces Glee, has plans to make the show even more ubiquitous.  Glee’s original episodes air on the Fox network, which makes sense as both Twentieth Television and Fox are owned by News Corps—both producer and distributor are owned by the same media conglomerate.   However, last summer, Twentieth Television sold syndication rights of Glee to Oxygen, a network owned by NBC Universal, which falls under the Comcast umbrella.  Here we see one television distributor making a deal with another one—a deal that has proved beneficial for NBC Universal’s Oxygen, which earned a record 4.4 million viewers during a weekend of Glee re-runs (a “Gleekend”).<span id="more-1032"></span></p>
<p>But Twentieth Television’s plans for Glee don&#8217;t stop there.   Twentieth’s mission is to get the rest of the country on board the “Glee train.” The television producer is seeking to sell syndication rights to television stations, both Fox affiliates and independent stations,across the country. This represents an attempt to go directly to exhibitors,many of whom have hours that need to be filled with content.  Glee re-runs could be a very viable option for these stations: the show’s audience is predominately female, and, crucially, predominately affluent.  This is the kind of audience that advertisers, or clients, are willing spend a lot of money on, as this demographic has a lot of buying power. Plus, Glee has proven to be a ratings smash, with both new episodes and re-runs earning large audiences, so acquiring the rights to air Glee could be financially smart for the exhibitors that are given the opportunity to grab a slice of the Glee pie.</p>
<p>As if that wasn’t enough, there is a spin-off reality show in the works. This summer, Oxygen will air The Glee Project, a reality show in which contestants will compete for a spot on Glee.  This program is yet another example of Glee’s already-abundant examples of linking pin activities, including CDs and music downloads featuring the songs head on the show.</p>

<p>Albiniak.P.(2011,February 14). Spencer, Levy to Head MTV&#8217;s Scripted Development.<em>Broadcasting &amp; Cable</em>. Retrieved from <a href="http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/463937-Spencer_Levy_to_Head_MTV_s_Scripted_Development.php" target="_blank">http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/463937-Spencer_Levy_to_Head_MTV_s_Scripted_Development.php</a></p>
<p>MTV’s scripted series recently appointed new leadership. The Network’s president or Programming David Janollari named Clay Spencer and Justin Levy the new heads. Janollari said that their combined experience makes them the perfect team to work together. Levy has worked on MTV scripted series before while Spencer is new to the network. Spencer’s diverse television career has had a successful track record; working on networks like The WB and an independent production company. Janollari and him have worked together before. Just like in the publishing world MTV is sticking to who has been successful. In demanding times for television it would not be wise to hire some brand new writer no one has heard of even if he or she looks to have good work. Janollari is hiring who he knows and who he thinks he can get good results from.</p>
<p><span id="more-900"></span></p>
<p>With MTV’s recent scandal in regards to their highly controversial series <em>Skins</em>, maybe it was time to get new management in the scripted sector of this network. Levy has already proven successful during his previous time and an MTV executive where he “spearheaded such scripted efforts as <em>The Hard Times of RJ Berger, Teen Wolf</em>, and <em>This is Awkward.” </em>Prior to MTV Levy worked as a director of NBC’s primetime series development. Working for NBC is a good credential to have under your belt and MTV recognized that.By filling the creator power role of their organization with an experienced writer, they not only help create a better product, but at the same allocate more power to Levy than they would with a lesser known producer.With the network’s new leaders for their scripted series maybe MTV’s scripted shows will be able to beat out the great rating of their reality shows like <em>Jersey Shore</em> for example. The power of using what you already know to be good cannot be underestimated.</p>
