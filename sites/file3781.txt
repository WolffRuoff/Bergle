								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So because of the research I did in nuclear physics this summer, I had the opportunity to go to the American Physics Society, Department of Nuclear Physics conference in beautiful Newport Beach, California a few weeks ago. I, along with my research professor and two other students that I worked with, flew out on a Tuesday afternoon.</p>
<p><a href="http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/11/60c103c01d5011e2b71422000a1e9f9b_7.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1497 aligncenter" src="http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/11/60c103c01d5011e2b71422000a1e9f9b_7-300x300.jpg" alt="Newark Airport Terminal to Orange County" width="300" height="300" srcset="http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/11/60c103c01d5011e2b71422000a1e9f9b_7-300x300.jpg 300w, http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/11/60c103c01d5011e2b71422000a1e9f9b_7-150x150.jpg 150w, http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/11/60c103c01d5011e2b71422000a1e9f9b_7.jpg 612w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>When I finally got off the six hour flight, it was only 10pm in California, but that was 1 a.m. back home, so as soon as I got checked into the hotel I went to bed.</p>
<p>The next day, we had no sessions that we had to attend, so the two other students and I joined up with a few kids from other universities and we went straight to the beach!</p>

<p><a href="http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/11/b57fa4f41e0c11e282c522000a1fa433_7.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1500 aligncenter" src="http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/11/b57fa4f41e0c11e282c522000a1fa433_7-300x300.jpg" alt="Beach, take two!" width="300" height="300" srcset="http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/11/b57fa4f41e0c11e282c522000a1fa433_7-300x300.jpg 300w, http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/11/b57fa4f41e0c11e282c522000a1fa433_7-150x150.jpg 150w, http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/11/b57fa4f41e0c11e282c522000a1fa433_7.jpg 612w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>The water was freezing cold, but the weather was absolutely beautiful. The entire time we were out, there wasn&#8217;t a single cloud in the sky. The hotel itself was incredible. There were tons of plants and palm trees. Here was the view from our room:</p>
<p><a href="http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/11/5372248a1dee11e2ab5722000a1f9684_7.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1499 aligncenter" src="http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/11/5372248a1dee11e2ab5722000a1f9684_7-300x300.jpg" alt="The view from our hotel room" width="300" height="300" srcset="http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/11/5372248a1dee11e2ab5722000a1f9684_7-300x300.jpg 300w, http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/11/5372248a1dee11e2ab5722000a1f9684_7-150x150.jpg 150w, http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/11/5372248a1dee11e2ab5722000a1f9684_7.jpg 612w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>The conference itself was an incredible, unique experience. Every day, I had the opportunity to sit in on talks and workshops from people who are the expects in their field from all over the United States. Most of the talks were on the cutting edge research that&#8217;s occurring now and types of research that will be occurring when we undergraduates enter the post graduate field.</p>
<p>The most important event, and the reason we flew out, was the undergraduate poster fair. This was where we undergrads presented posters of our summer research and professionals, graduate students, professors and post-doctorate researchers would walk around and ask you questions about your research.</p>
<p><a href="http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/11/78.jpeg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1501 aligncenter" src="http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/11/78-300x225.jpeg" alt="Conference Experience for Undergraduate Poster Fair" width="300" height="225" srcset="http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/11/78-300x225.jpeg 300w, http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/11/78.jpeg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>During the poster fair, I met a ton of people from some places I hadn&#8217;t even heard of, and I had the opportunity to make contacts in the physics world that I probably wouldn&#8217;t have ever talked to on my own. And they&#8217;re all doing their own interesting research, some in topics I have never come across in any of my studies.</p>
<p>In total, there were about 120 undergraduate students there from across the US, and I made a few good friends out there from different universities, friends who I still chat with now and bounce ideas around with when we all inevitably reach a sticky spot in our respective researches.</p>
<p>This was definitely one of the greatest academic experiences that I have ever had.</p>
