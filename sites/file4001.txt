								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Is Allentown deceiving me? I was told leaving sunny Los Angeles and moving to Eastern Pennsylvania for college would have me perpetually scared of going outdoors&#8230; But here I sit in the middle of Muhlenberg&#8217;s campus marveling at the 72 degree warmth and feeling a lot like this place is literally my home.</p>
<p>I know, I know, my last post was referencing the rain, but honestly, that day feels like an anomaly in the scheme of this first month. For the most, part it&#8217;s all blue skies, crisp warm air, and sunshine.</p>
<p>When I describe my weather-oriented confusion to my friends, most of whom are east coast natives, I am promptly given an eery chuckle followed by &#8220;just wait.&#8221; Not sure what I should be waiting for.. or why they are laughing.. But I will get back to you in a couple of months with hopefully a good answer.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I&#8217;m going to finish this assigned reading and enjoy the view.</p>
<p>Until next time!<br />
