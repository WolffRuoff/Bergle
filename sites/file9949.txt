Beginning in 2008, Elsevier interviewed over 3,000  researchers,  research librarians and application developers to discern  the obstacles  the scientific community is encountering most. Elsevier found  that  researchers need a better way to search, discover, store, share and   reuse the data that works with their individual research.  Developers  need access to research data to be able to develop the  applications  that will best assist them. Librarians want to expose the content they  have in their collections. The launch  of the SciVerse platform aims to  fulfill all these needs by providing a  new single-point of access that  will enable collaboration across these three groups<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: large\">For more information about SciVerse, please  visit <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http:\/\/mail.elsevier-alerts.com\/go.asp?\/bESI001\/mPIWDJ1F\/qYRN4J1F\/uUTT6CJD\/xFM74J1F\/cutf%2D8\">www.acceleratescience.com<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: large\">We apologize for the inconvenience.<\/span><span style=\"font-size: large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"\/\/mail.elsevier-alerts.com\/log.asp?\/bESI001\/mPIWDJ1F\/uUTT6CJD\/xFM74J1F\/cutf%2D8\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&#8211;from the publisher&#8211; ScienceDirect will be unavailable due to scheduled maintenance by the publisher, Elsevier, for approximately 9 hours on Saturday, 28 August from 7:30AM to 4:30PM.
