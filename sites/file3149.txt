<p>And that&#8217;s a wrap folks! My freshman year of college is a offally in the rear view mirror. Some of you have been with me along the journey&#8230;reading about my fear of cold weather, to writing my first college essay, the long wrestling season and more.</p>
<p>What an incredible ride it&#8217;s been. The year was an endless collection of ups, downs, and invaluable experiences that I&#8217;ll cherish forever.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t help but be nostalgic looking back at the memories, both good and bad. No matter the pleasure or struggle, I can confidently say I learned so much about myself this year. I can look back and measurably see that I changed for the better in several ways. I think that&#8217;s indicative too of the type of environment that Muhlenberg has been in facilitating that personal growth.</p>
<p>Aside from the pictures, posts, and texts, that all serve as evidence, I have the unique privilege of being able to reflect on my past blogs as a reminder of where my head was at during different parts of the year. On one hand, rereading them brings me straight to the moment I wrote it, and it seems like an instant ago. But at the same time, many of those individual highs and lows seem ancient now. All in all, I&#8217;m so grateful to have had the chance to catalog my life this year and I hope you enjoyed experiencing it with me.</p>
<p>One down, three to go!</p>
<p>Until potentially next time, (depending on what admissions does with me, I may or may not blog about it in the fall. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="ðŸ˜‰" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the final class in my religion/philosophy course &#8220;Meaning of Life,&#8221; ProfessorÂ Abhishek Ghosh offered that we ditch Taylor (the building of our class)Â basement, and venture to downtown Allentown instead. Last week weÂ all agreed that Billy&#8217;s Diner, a classic Muhlenberg favorite, would be the destination.</p>
<p>Most studentsÂ showed up in what was the perfect culmination to the semester. We broke away from the confines of a classroom to enjoy a great breakfast and get to know each other a little more personally.</p>
<p>It was a great time!</p>
<p>***Other professors please take note***</p>
