								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The committee has recommended to OIT that Muhlenberg College adopt GAFE (Google Apps for Education) as the next communication and collaboration platform. The committee&#8217;s report will be posted soon; however, in the meantime, you can read more about this decision on Allan Chen&#8217;s <a href="http://it.blogs.muhlenberg.edu" target="_blank">Information Technology blog</a>.</p>
<p>I, personally, wish to extend my deep, deep gratitude to the members of the committee for the overall process that led to this decision. Additionally, we wish to extend much appreciation to  the team of testers who provided invaluable feedback as they tested various scenarios in both systems. This required a great deal of time, commitment, and learning on their own.</p>
<p>Both Microsoft Office 365 and Google Apps for Education have many strong benefits. It was a challenge to determine which really had the edge over the other. We are confident that, overall, both individual and communal experiences using email, calendar, tasks, communication, and collaboration applications will be enhanced. We thank the entire campus community for your input, feedback, and patience throughout this process. We look forward to working with OIT through the transition and training.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-family: Lucida Grande; font-size: medium;">We need and value your input. The Communication &amp; Collaboration Evaluation Committee has evaluated potential software suites to replace Groupwise, as well as expand our collaborative capabilities. The committee has narrowed the selection down to two main cloud-based choices: Google Apps for Education and Microsoft Office 365. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Lucida Grande; font-size: medium;">We are now testing applications within these two product lines and we need your input on features and functionality that we should explore in order to make the best informed decision for the campus. Please complete the following survey:</span></p>
<p><u><span style="color: #0000ff; font-family: Lucida Grande; font-size: medium;"><a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/comcollab"><i>https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/comcollab</i></a></span></u></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Lucida Grande; font-size: medium;">This survey should take approximately 5-10 minutes to complete. Your responses are anonymous, however, we are also asking for volunteers who are interested in assisting the committee test these applications. Even for those who volunteer to assist, data responses will be viewed in the aggregate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Lucida Grande; font-size: medium;">Thank you for your assistance and input!</span></p>
