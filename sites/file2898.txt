CEO Mel Karmazin predicts that improving auto sales, declining capital expenditure, and the up-coming release of Sirius XM 2.0 to improve functionality will also add to the company&#8217;s success on into the future. Competition for Sirius XM, however, may be growing stronger.</p>
<p>Pandora Radio will be available as part of the new Chevy MyLink in-vehicle entertainment system, allowing listeners to synch their smartphones containing their existing Pandora accounts to the system.</p>
<p><span id="more-860"></span></p>
<p>In addition, GM will be incorporating voice and song recognition software so that the driver can for the first time control their listening through a device other than their smartphone device. According to Pandora SVP Jessica Steel, over half of radio listening takes place in the car. Now with Pandora as accessible in the car as Sirius XM or terrestrial radio, not to mention portable and in-dash music players, they stand to benefit from this large in-vehicle listening market and compete with Sirius XM directly.</p>
<p>Pandora recently detailed plans to go public, which Sirius XM said was ultimately non-threatening; however, if Pandora, which as of 2009 had 40 million users, can gather significant financial investors, then it is possible that they could integrate into the same market areas and capture a significant portion of Sirius XM&#8217;s target audience. Pandora and Sirius XM are different in that listeners must pay for a subscription to Sirius XM, which is a satellite radio. Pandora is free, on the other hand, but its profits depend on advertisements directed towards highly specified and coveted audiences. Pandora is based on the Internet. Since Pandora is free, is targets a younger audience, from around 17-15 who d not necessarily have the finances to support serious XM subscriptions; this could have long term effects if Pandora becomes successful in gaining brand loyalty. Additionally, younger audiences prove to be more tech-savvy and opt to use their smartphone devices for more and more services.</p>
<p>However, they both ultimately offer a more personalized listening experience in increasingly overlapping environments, which gives Pandora something of a competitive advantage in this regard. Pandora allows one to skip songs and build personalized music stations, while Sirius XM offers only present channels which are differentiated by genre and station-selected playlists. Listeners may come to decide that they would rather be free to customize their own listening on Pandora at the expense of listening to advertisements. This of course would negatively affect the number of subscriptions to Sirius XM which, again, depends on subscriptions for their revenue.</p>
