								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Snapchat has quickly become one of the leading social media sites that people use throughout their everyday lives. Although people of all ages use Snapchat, teenagers and others in their early twenties make up most of the user population. With this being the case, the NBA and NFL among other professional sports leagues have decided to bring their own featured content for the users of Snapchat to watch. On days when there is an important sporting event going on such as the MLB playoffs or NBA finals, Snapchat will let users that attend any of these events post real time videos from their phones to the events “My Story”. Snapchat users from all around the world can then watch these snaps in real time to witness the plays and sounds of each event. Snapchat is proving to be the place where teens and other users can get videos and photos that take them closer to sports. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The article that I read discussed why sports fans are using Snapchat for their sports content as opposed to other social media sites such as Facebook or Twitter. Based on my encounters with each of these apps, Snapchat is more easily navigable than any other social media site. While Facebook or Twitter might have one video of a touchdown or amazing play, Snapchat usually has well over 100 seconds of footage if the sporting event has a My Story. With one click of the button short clips of pre-game tailgates,national anthem, fans cheering in the stands, and plays from the game come across the screen without any clicking out or loading another video. With teenagers being labeled as impatient, Snapchat fits the mold perfectly as it is the most effective and quickest way to make yourself feel closer to the actual events of each sport. The article considers that unpredictability is a reason that fans use Snapchat as opposed to Twitter or Facebook. Sports can take a turn in a matter of seconds and one play can change the whole game. The author says that, “the ephemerality of the platform can be alluring. In contrast to Facebook, Twitter, or other social media platforms where a post can live forever, one can cheer when your team scores without worrying about looking dumb if they end up losing,” (Constine, 2014, p.1). On social media websites like Twitter or Facebook, users usually wait until after the event is over to post celebratory things about their teams win because they do not want to jinx or speak too soon. Snapchat is an app that lets people show events happening in real time so this problem does not occur. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With Snapchat being occupied by teenagers and people in their twenties, it will continue to be at the forefront of social media usage and maybe even surpass sites like Twitter and Facebook. Teenagers look to Snapchat and will continue to look to Snapchat to keep up to date with sporting events. With the success that Snapchat has had with leagues like the MLB, NBA, or NFL, it will be only a matter of time before others start showing their content to the users of Snapchat. </span></p>
