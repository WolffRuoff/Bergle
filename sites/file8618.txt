					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I did not know Bob well, unfortunately, but I was lucky to have the opportunity to set up a photo shoot last summer with Bob and Ilene, President Helm and Dean Karen Green.  The photo was to mark the occasion of the first lunch in the new Ilene and Robert Wood Dining Commons, lovingly prepared and served to Bob and Ilene by Sodexo.  As the photographer set up the shot, Ilene turned to Bob, smoothed his hair and kissed him.  I&#039;ve not forgotten that moment, and the loving care Ilene provided for her husband.  My thoughts and prayers are with Ilene and the entire Wood family.&lt;/p&gt;
