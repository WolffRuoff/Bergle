The images you create with Wordle are yours to use however you like. You can print them out, or save them to the Wordle gallery to share with your friends.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Word clouds are not only visually interesting, but can also help users examine major themes and issues in a text, identify key vocabulary, reveal overused words in a user&#8217;s own writing, and more.<\/p>\n<p>See, for example, word clouds of James Joyce&#8217;s\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.wordle.net\/show\/wrdl\/2255365\/A_Portrait_of_the_Artist_as_a_Young_Man\">A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man<\/a>\u00a0or the\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.wordle.net\/show\/wrdl\/1381018\/US_Constitution\">U.S. Constitution<\/a>.
