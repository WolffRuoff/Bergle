Other memorable evenings have included Inauguration Trivia, which was held during President Williams Inaugural weekend, and Jurassic Trivia which we promoted with a short video (<em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/muhlenbergtrexlerlibrary\/videos\/10158120838565621\/\">check it out on our Facebook page<\/a><\/em>).  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trivia Night attracts between 80 and 130 participants with the Spring semester being the more popular. Teams of 3-6 members work together to achieve the highest score. &nbsp;Each member of the three highest scoring teams win Amazon Gift cards. &nbsp;There are also opportunities for individuals to win prizes during the evening.
