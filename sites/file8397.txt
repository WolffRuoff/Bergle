								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The concepts of identity, self-promotion, and manipulation of an intended audience are significant aspects of the Twitter world. Users have become addicted to the “micro-celebrity” (Marwick 121) social status and are feeding off of their, “audience that they can strategically maintain through ongoing communication and interaction” (Marwick 121). It’s interesting to see the different goals that each Twitter user has in mind when posting tweets for the public to see. Some users, such as giant corporations, use specific marketing tactics to manipulate users and appeal to a niche’s specific interests. “Soraya Darabi, the social media strategist for the New York Times, said, ‘I’m constantly aware of my followers.’” (Marwick 126) She is the perfect example of what it looks like to have an inauthentic goal in mind when tweeting, for she creates an explicit social image for the sole purpose of gaining followers and possible fiscal rewards. Soraya Darabi does not use Twitter for her own personal self expression, her decision, “to reveal personal information”, is, “strategic, and often framed as a way to reinforce relationships with followers” (Marwick 127). This contrasts with individuals who do not have a lot of followers because their “audience awareness”, does not, “factor greatly into their writing” (Marwick 116). Twitter users who do not have many followers “see Twitter as a personal space” (Marwick 124), in which authenticity is maintained and balanced with impression management.</p>
<p>The audience also plays a large role in the kinds of tweets produced. Since users can not actually comprehend the extent of their audience, “a tweets actual readers differ from its producer’s imagined audience” (Marwick 117). Between other social platforms that allow the share feature, tweets can be seen on countless, “communication channels” (Marwick 117), which can be daunting to the Twitter user but also be used to one’s advantage. There are many different perspectives on the kinds of tweets on the internet. Factors such as censorship, the intended audience, and the appeal to multiple audiences are all taken into consideration while tweeting. This is important to Twitter users because they do not want to be chastised for a specific tweet that was posted but then shared to an unintended audience that does not agree with the user’s views.</p>
<p>While the knowledge of having an intended audience is very important for successful Twitter users, the ability to navigate multiple twitter communities also comes into play when focusing on identity. The phenomenon of context collapse describes how the requirement to display a, “verifiable, singular identity makes it impossible to differ self-presentation strategies, creating tension as diverse groups of people flock to social network sites (boyd, 2008)” (Marwick 122). The public can not tell the difference between self-promotion and commercialization versus one’s authentic self and personal expression. Erving Goffman highlights the interesting analogy between twitter users and actors, for each tweet is a performance intended for a specific audience and group of people, especially noting the fact that, “self-presentation is collaborative” (Marwick 123). Just the way an actor can not perform without an audience, a twitter user can not post a tweet without a group of people to see and interact with it. This public presentation of various narrative can lead to criticism, “encourage social norms” (Marwick 123), and provoke an unwanted reputation for a given user. These consequences of tweeting reinforce the idea of, “’impression management’” (Marwick 123), but also sheds a light on the relationship between social media and identity and how people can accidentally create an unwanted identity for themselves.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Way too often does Apple come out with a new “must have” product. The most recent product is the iPhone 6S, but that’s not what I am here to discuss, it is all about the new Apple Watch product. Its price ranges from a reasonable $349 to an outrageous $17,000, “The fancy cases and straps are nice, but it’s the software that I’m sold on” (OCHS, 2015). Does not matter the strap fabric its the content that the watch is able to provide you which makes you forget about your previous desire to have the fanciest watch. With just a few swipes left and right, up and down you basically have your phone smashed into a small square on your wrist. You receive notifications just as you would on your iPhone. Siri, Apple Pay, Phone, Messages, Mail, and Calendar are all accessible through the easy use of your new Apple Watch. Everything works so smoothly and easily you quickly forget and don’t even care about what the mere strap is made out of, it is all about the technology itself. Even with all of these perks of having an Apple Watch there were minor concerns. The battery life like many technological products is something customers worry about. OCHS was one of those worrying customers, “Apple is good about not overestimating battery life and from what I saw in my demo, these figures seem reasonable. The watch is designed to get you the info you want quickly, both in how the information is presented and how easy it is to move between it” (OCHS, 2015). The Apple Watch highlights the quick fast motions and minimal time taking it requires to access any apple, this allows customers to find what they are looking for in record timing only using up little battery life at a time.</p>
<p>As more people begin to purchase Apple Watches the amount of time people spend on their cell phone may actually reduce. Everyday people check their phones constantly whether or not they are waiting for a text, or checking social media, or trying to call someone, people are on their phones way too much and thats that, me included of course. With notifications that are sent to your phone but received on your Apple Watch the constant pulling out the cell phone may not stay such a bad habit.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is no surprise that young adults spend more time with media and technology daily than any other activity. &#8220;It has been reported that young adults spend between 11 and 12 hours a day with technology and media&#8221; (Vaterlaus, Patten, Roche, Young 2015). Along with this, young adulthood has been said to be a risky time period for the development of poor diet and exercise habits (Vaterlaus et al. 2015). There are several factors that influence health behaviors, and it is predicted that social media could be a relevant factor in contributing to a person&#8217;s diet. Some of the considerations in making food choices include time availability and convenience (Vaterlaus et al. 2015). Interestingly enough, it is said that television may play a role in people&#8217;s dietary choices mainly due to food related advertisements. The connection with this is that when young adults watch advertisements about food, a lot of times unhealthy foods, it is likely that they could become hungry and add unnecessary snacks to their diet (Vaterlaus et al. 2015).</p>
<p>A research study was conducted in an effort to determine more specific influences of social media on young adult health behaviors. The sample consisted of young adults that were recruited from five courses at a midwestern university in the United States. The results of the survey showed that the majority of participants felt that social media does have an influence on young adult health behaviors. Three main themes appeared to be the main influences on the young adult experience with social media which are social media as a motivator and barrier to exercise, the perceived connection between food and social media, and the impact of posting pictures of food online (Vaterlaus et al. 2015).</p>
<p>Participants concluded that social media could be &#8220;both a motivator and a barrier to exercise in young adulthood&#8221; (Vaterlaus et al. 2015). As a motivator, social media provides specific apps like Nike+ and Map My Run to track progress on work outs. This feature increases accountability, and leads to physical improvement. As a barrier, participants felt that social media could become a distraction during exercise. An example of this would be a phone vibrating signaling a text message or other notification. Participants also reported that social media is associated with increased food choices, especially with applications like Pinterest, people can search for any kind of recipe they could ever want. However, people felt that constantly posting pictures of food online makes people more hungry, and therefore tempted to eat (Vaterlaus et al. 2015).</p>
<p>&#8220;Social media was perceived to be a distraction that could lead to (a) disconnection during meal times and (b) making poor food choices&#8221; (Vaterlaus et al. 2015). In this sense, participants explained that now people spend their meal times on their cell phone instead of conversing with those around them. Poor food choices are also more likely to be made because people are more interested in what is on their phone and may not pay attention to what they are eating, causing them to consume a lot more than planned.</p>
<p>Social media as both a motivator and barrier to exercise, the perceived connection between food and social media, and the impact of posting pictures of food online all connect because they each have some kind of impact on young adults&#8217; health. I felt that an article like this tied in well with class discussions and course readings because of how often we talk about social media and its various impacts.</p>
<p>I found this research study to be very fascinating, though I can&#8217;t say that I was surprised by the results. I was intrigued by all of the different angles in which the study was examined from in terms of social media being a factor in young adult&#8217;s health behaviors, food playing a role, and television commercials as well. I look forward to reading about what future studies show.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With AirBNB&#8217;s expansive networking of users, ease of usage, and appeal of modern day traveling, it is easier now than ever to truly find a home away from home. For those that are unfamiliar with the estimated $20 billion valued company, Airbnb offers easy renting for guests that are looking for anything from single rooms and apartments to castles and tree houses. The company&#8217;s booming and unique platform of connecting hosts and travelers without owning any room itself has driven it so such success.</span></p>
<p>With the company&#8217;s unique advertising of having guests stay in real homes of others they try to optimize safety and transparency. Technology today makes us feel like we can market ourselves to appear a certain way but still hold onto a sense of security and privacy. Airbnb requires that all guests provide a valid ID as well as all hosts with videotaping equipment explicitly say so in their listing. Precautions such as these make it so guests and users alike can display a fake persona or invade a guest&#8217;s privacy. Hosts may also use the apps new messaging feature to converse with interested guests to determine if they want to accept the person&#8217;s offer. With features like this technology provides ways for people to communicate while forcing them to be transparent.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">All though certain rules such as these are put into place there are also defaults in the system. Reports of vandalism of houses with extreme damages have occurred as well as people&#8217;s rooms being put up for rent without their knowledge. Despite the Airbnb&#8217;s ability to cut out any middleman in the process of booking between host and guest there are still gaps and miscommunication that come when using technology to communicate. Just because the network has made it easier to access one another doesn’t mean we always are who we say we are behind a screen. Airbnb has the ability to make it possible to not even have to face the person that is renting your space. The chatting and messenger feature can also be harmful in that people get tricked into knowing the person behind the screen when in fact that is not the case.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>People today have grown up putting their everyday lives on social media. Everything that they have done and want people to know have gone up on some sort of social media whether it was a Facebook post, a tweet, a Snapchat story, or an Instagram photo, it was almost as they have to share their successes and experiences with their peers. But it is crucial to remember that once you upload something onto the internet it is never really gone.</p>
<p>This is where cyberstalking can come into place, cyberstalking is when an individual or group use the internet to stalk or harass an individual. Most cyberstalking is intended as an act of revenge or blackmail towards an individual or group who want something and intend to get it at all costs. With peoples lives on the internet it is very easy for hackers or even people without any hacking skills to retrieve data about someone that may be used to blackmail or harass someone with. With bad cases of cyber stalking generally the stalking moves from online to real life. The Wikipedia mentioned, “Even police and prosecutors find themselves at risk, as gang members ad other organized criminals find out where they live—often to intimidate them into dropping a case” (Cyberstalking, 2015). Gangs find a way whether or not it is through the internet or in person to locate their target and track them down in order to harass or even threaten the individual to back off. “[A] final report states that approximately 1.2 million victims had stalkers who used technology to find them” (“Cyberstalking, 2015). This is why it is important to be careful online because when people start to become reckless and don’t take certain precautions when posting something online they are an easy target for people to take advantage of. However not all cyberstalking is used to the extreme like these gangs, there is cyber trolling. It is important to distinguish the difference because trolling is generally harmless where as stalking is more persistent and causes problems for the victim.</p>
<p>As teenagers most would end up cyber trolling, it is very common for you to end up on someone’s Facebook page and then then see someone really pretty or attractive and then go to their page and so on so forth. Soon enough you might find yourself on your friends best friends, dads cousins friends daughters profile without even realizing how many people you have gone through. It’s easy to get caught up in the moment of innocent stalking but it is important to realize that attackers are able to do this but with a higher purpose in mind.</p>
<p>Over all it is important that you monitor what you put online because attackers will find a way to cyber stalk you and collect information that is just meant for friends and families to see, only for people you trust.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the ever evolving world today, teens have become so accustomed to the presence and use of technology in their day to day lives. With the existence of technology, comes the ever-growing want and need of two top priorities: to be connected to friends, family, and strangers around the world and to have one’s privacy remain intact while doing so. In July 2011, the wants and needs of the aforementioned teens came true via the release of Snapchat. The app was created by Evan Spiegel, Bobby Murphy, and Reggie Brown as a requirement for a course at Stanford University (“Snapchat,” 2015).  The app’s platform encourages users to send candid pictures of whatever it is that they are doing in that moment. The unsaved photos are then sent to user’s friends and are deleted after a maximum of ten seconds which is set by the sender. Although this form of social media sounds utopic, are teens relying so heavily on the assumption that the pictures are deleted forever that they let their guard down? The answer is yes.</p>
<p>An increased sense of privacy is typically accompanied by an increased sense of indestructibility. Within the four years that Snapchat has been up and running, sexting has become overwhelmingly popular because users believe that once the content disappears after the time limit expires, it is gone forever (“Snapchat,” 2015). Contrary to popular belief, Snapchat’s main privacy page states that “there may be ways to access messages while still in temporary storage on recipients’ devices or, forensically, even after they are deleted (“Privacy Policy,” 2014).” Therefore, users of Snapchat are being deceived by themselves. By not knowing the full parameters of the app, one is acting in ways that they would not if they did not believe the app was private. The fact that this not-really-private-privacy is not hidden but rather in regular sized text on the main webpage of Snapchat, shows that teens are not looking carefully at what they are agreeing to when signing up for an account. Consequently, I believe that teens today allow themselves to get into the trouble that they are getting in because they are too quick to believe what they want to be true.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Social media as we know it has become so widely accessible and weaved into every aspect of our lives that tit has given our generation a name of digital natives. From Twitter to Instagram and all social media platforms in-between, technology today has the ability to satisfy our need for human connection. Whether it be by seeing updated photos of events or phrases of our night being limited to a tweet, it is hard to  escape knowing peoples whereabouts. One of the many dangers of this though is the increasing  amount of platforms to bully and hurt people on. Numerous social media apps gain fame and net worth through their fan bases but their initial  start up point is in investors willing to put money towards their ideas. Yik Yak was able to be valued at almost $300 million because of its investors believed in the app&#8217;s ability to  create &#8220;hyper local forums [providing] a sense of community  and a place to be our genuine selves&#8221;. The consequences though are threats and demeaning comments that are becoming increasingly more prevalent even as the apps owners try to control exactly what is allowed on the platform. Author William D. Cohan of  the article &#8220;In the Rise of Yik Yak App, Profits and Ethics Collide&#8221;, he brings up the question if the initial investors should be held responsible for these actions. Whether of not theses investors foresaw the possible down sides of this app or not comes into question and we must consider if introducing new technology in general should be monitored more closely in order to provide a safe environment for the use of these tools. In the new age of digital natives it is arguable that no generation has had more access to being connected to one another than any before. Social media platforms have the ability to connect people from within one and half miles of each other, such as in Yik Yak, to across the globe with apps like Instagram or Twitter.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Even with the dangerous persuasion of social networking sites, along with the anonymity and individualistic power there is online today, the vast majority of our worlds digital users still shy away from understanding what really is hidden within “The Cloud”. In my article entitled, “Influence of Social Media on Teenagers” written by Suren Ramasubbu, many of the realistic threats of the internet are looked at in comparison with the benefits new technologies have to offer. We all know that social media can broaden social connections throughout the world and may seem harmless as advertised thousands of times per day but what isn’t shown are the life altering repercussions in both professional and personal areas of life.</p>
<p>The real problem is right in front of us. Facebook depression, Internet addiction, cyber bullying, sleep deprivation, obesity and sexting are just a few of the things that should call for the attention and be recognized as a major problem in our world today. Ramasubbu affirmatively states, “The lack or difficulty in self-regulation and susceptibility to peer pressure makes adolescents vulnerable to such evils as <a href="http://guilfordjournals.com/doi/abs/10.1521/jscp.2014.33.8.701">Facebook depression</a>, sexting, and cyberbullying, which are realistic threats” (Ramasubbu, 2015, p.1.). Our youth’s vulnerability can lead to much more than just an occasional blog post or tweet. The consequences of cyberbullying can be life altering. Ramasubbu made a very interesting point in that the two kinds of people who are likely to be cyberbullies are the popular ones and those on the fringes of society. Many technologies today have the power to disconnect children from reality. It is those people who then feel invincible hiding their insecurities behind their 20 inch laptop computer screen to go out and hurt somebody else’s life. It becomes very ironic how the individualistic nature of social networking can make it difficult to recognize a victim of cyberbullying. Not only does social networking give adolescents the power to bully behind a computer screen but it hides those being bullied as well. Ramasubbu closes his argument by saying, “Adolescence is the time for teens to spread their wings and take the tentative first flight out into the world…” (Ramasubbu, 2015, p.1.). He encourages teens to make a productive leap into the world, and not the digital world. He advocates that teens must learn to understand what the internet has to offer and how these things can both positively and negatively impact society.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In society today I am almost positive that most teenagers can’t even fathom a day without social media and their personal cellphones. We spend half our day on our phones looking through social media and texting such as Instagram, Facebook, and SnapChat. A new and upcoming social media app, Yik Yak allows users to post anonymously thoughts and comments about anything they please. It was created in 2013 by Tyler Droll and Brooks Buffington who were recent graduates at Furman University. According to Mahler, Droll and Buffington, “came up with the ideas after realizing that there were only a handful of popular Twitter accounts at Furman…they hoped to created a more democratic social media network, one where users didn’t need a large number of followers or friends to have their posts read widely” (Mahler, 2015, p.1). This is a valid reason because social media today is all about likes and how many followers you have. On Snapchat I hear people rave about how many people have seen their story and on Instagram how many likes they got within a certain time span. Not having to make a Yik Yak profile allows anyone and everyone around your area to see your thoughts not just people who follow you or you may know personally. While it is a good way to get your thoughts out anonymously it is used way too many times to put out negative comments about people or things.</p>
<p>In this article Jonathan Mahler interviewed a professor who filed multiple complaints about inappropriate things said about her on Yik Yak that her students posted about her. Unfortunately, nothing was done about it because the selling feature of Yik Yak is that ever post is completely anonymous making it impossible to find the person responsible for the inappropriate posts. Colleges have no control to students from accessing Yik Yak because if they just block access through their Wi-Fi networks students can easily just use their cell service which colleges have no control over. This is a huge issue because today so many people are targeted through cyber bullying. Having Yik Yak completely anonymous has its ups and downs, it allows people to ask questions that may be too uncomfortable to ask if their identity was exposed to the pubic. However cyber attacks that happened to the professor at Michigan are much easier to execute with rarely any consequences.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recently, New York Times Journalist, Stuart Goldenberg, wrote an article called “IPhone 6s’s Hands-Free Siri Is an Omen of the Future”, which essentially conveys the idea that our society is taking a new, technological direction towards voice recognition and artificial intelligence. He describes the two as “A necessary part of Modern Computing”. A well defended statement but in a way he is almost contradicting his own argument because if he is saying that these two applications are “necessary” to Modern computing throughout our society then why is he minimizing its significance by describing it as a “part”? Later in the article he describes this revolutionary new idea, known as “Ambient Computing”, which Stuart describes as “a future in which robotic assistants are always on hand to answer questions, take notes, take orders or otherwise function as auxiliary brains to whom you might offload many of your chores”. Oddly enough he describes this as a “futuristic” idea but can’t one argue that our Phones, Computers, TVs, Videogames and all of our other twenty first century devices could hold the title of “Robotic Assistants” due to the fact that they do withstand most of our Dailey loads, making our lives not only easier but more simplistic as well. So rather Ambient Computing be considered a “futuristic” goal, I think its fair to say that its something that we have easily touched heavily upon but that there is also so much still out there that we haven’t created that can still revolutionize our day to day lives. Goldenberg eventually takes a social turn on the power of artificial intelligence, along with voice recognition, when he writes “It will be slightly creepy and completely helpful”. Conveying the idea that, at first, we may be very hesitant towards this very odd but incredible technology but that instead of seeing either one or the other, we will see that even those who find it to be “creepy” or “odd” will submit to its foreignness due to the beneficial value it has to offer. Stuart then shows us how these creatures of this never ending technology realm are adapting to this new technology when he points out a very compatible new app called “Sound Hound” which is basically a voice powered search engine that has the ability and potential to revolutionize the way we search by giving us more in depth results of the precise thing we were looking for. Illustrating the idea that the many faces of our technological world are completely on board with this very clear-cut direction. Towards the end of the article, Stuart starts to describe his take on the steps we will soon see most individuals go through when cooping with this new machinery when he utters “The more assistants there are, and the more you use them, the more natural they feel — and that means the more you’ll use them, feeding the cycle”. I noticed how he used the word “more” consecutively throughout that single sentence, demonstrating the idea that there is always going to be more, and that there will never come a time when people will stop thinking of new ideas. This repetition of such a simplistic world also shows that even though all of these new creations are beyond beneficial to our society, we don’t really have a chose as to if we want them to play a role in our lives. Each new deice always seems to find away into our pockets, signifying the idea that even though we “use” the technology, that we are actually, in a sense, just mere slaves that feed on the aid of these machines. At the end of the day I think its important to realize that technology will always be “there” but the term, “there” is broad, it could mean in our homes, in a store, or even in our pockets but just because its “there” doesn’t mean we have to use it, or buy it, or surround our lives around it. We have to realize that, just like everything else in life, technology is what we make of it and we, as individuals, have the power to choose the technology we find necessary to better ourselves and the technology that we consider to be wasteful.</p>
