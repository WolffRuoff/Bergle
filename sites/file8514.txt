								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Social Media is a lethal weapon. When hearing this statement some people might be puzzled trying to figure out what it might mean. Although people may feel that social media is amazing for its ability to give each person who it is accessible to a voice, this is far from the case. Facebook and Twitter, two of the most popular social networking sites that we use in our everyday lives are flooded with terroristic propaganda used to help benefit various terrorist organizations. A book published by the United States government titled, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">The Evolution of Terrorist Propaganda: The Paris Attack and Social Media, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> talks about the growing concern over terrorist organizations’ ability to use social media. The book continues to talk about the knowledge that terrorist organizations have as it says, “Terrorists know the benefit of social media. Social Media is easy to use, it is free, and it reaches everyone in the world,”(1). ISIS , who has recently come into view for the United States government and its citizens, uses social media to broadcast their horrible videos that show their terrible acts to the entire world. ISIS uses these videos in an attempt to recruit new members to their “caliphate” not just in the Middle East, but around the world due to the abilities of social media. With a growing terrorist organization presence on Twitter and Facebook, these companies and the United States are faced with a huge dilemma. Should they do whatever it takes to remove all the content posted by terrorist organizations to prevent recruitment or should they leave the content so they can use it for intelligence to help stop the terrorist organizations. The United States and Social Media companies must figure out a strategy to help improve this issue. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As the reading continues, it talks about occurrences where terrorist groups have used social media. Twitter has run into major problems with terrorist groups being on their website such as, “for years Twitter was asked to shut down an account of the foreign terrorist organization al- Shabaab, which pledged allegiance to al-Qaeda,”(2). In 2013, al-Shabaab’s account live tweeted their attack on the Westgate Mall in Kenya that killed 72 people. By Twitter not listening to these complaints, they let a terrorist organization live tweet so the rest of the world was able to see , which could have easily been prevented by Twitter. The reading continued to talk about the negatives of social media saying, “the use of Internet to radicalize and recruit homegrown terrorists is the single most important and dangerous innovation since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Approaches that are aimed at reducing the supply of violent extremist content on the Internet are neither feasible nor desirable.’’ The United States and other nations know that they are fighting a very tough battle against terrorists organization on social networking websites. In my opinion, these sites should look to eliminate every terrorist affiliated page. ISIS’ main strength is its ability to recruit and send messages using social media. I feel that if companies like Facebook and Twitter could cut off ISIS’ ability to use social media, their efforts would be extremely weakened. Having information about terrorist organizations like ISIS by using their posts can be beneficial, but the United States has been very good at knowing where and when ISIS mobilizes and with drone technology they are able to attack without sending military personnel to the battlefield to fight. United States citizens have also began to try to join the ISIS caliphate. Many of these people have been caught before being able to travel to Syria to join, but some have been successful in their efforts. Social media is the reason for this willingness to join ISIS. The United States and social networking websites have made strides to help put an end to terrorist organization’s ability to share their ideas and messages with the world,  but it will be a long, hard battle that the United States and the rest of the world will continue to fight.</span></p>
