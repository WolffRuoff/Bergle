								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How we bring up our children in this world is so important and our role as mentors, as friends, and as family members is crucial in their development. As much faith and belief we put in our children to grow up to become amazingly unique individuals, they cannot do it on their own. In the article written by Laursen and Birmingham (2003), they blatantly say “Children require the presence of at least one caring person who can provide support for healthy development and learning, engender trust and love, and convey compassion, understanding, respect, and interest” (pg. 240). Humans are built to be resilient, and strong individuals, and it is incredible how we are capable of overcoming many challenges and obstacles in our lives. Children can grow up with exposure to biological risks, poverty, family problems, etc, but the children who come out being okay or more protected are the ones who have a strong family support system, personal strengths, self-resilience, and protective buffers. What I found to be extremely important in this article is the list of seven &#8220;resiliencies&#8221; that represent behaviors that children can learn and practice through their surroundings, such as in their family, school, and community centers. The seven resiliencies are: asking questions through insight, being independent, creating relationships with people who matter, taking initiative, using imagination, finding the humor in things, and lastly doing the right thing. Children can succeed more in life when they feel protected, feel heard, and feel loved, especially when this comes from people who can believe in their abilities. As a result, the children will feel like they matter, that their lives have meaning, and that they have some form of autonomy in their lives. As a mentor for a child, there are seven characteristics of what a caring relationship looks like: trust, attention, empathy, availability, affirmation, respect, and virtue. Actions speak louder than words, and for these children, they are more than deserving of your time, your undivided attention, your understanding, your validation, and your trust. Ultimately, children need at least one adult (a parent, a grandparent, a volunteer, a professional, or a religious leader) who accepts them unconditionally, who cares for them, and gives them a sense of love and belonging. If all of these things can be given to any child wholeheartedly, then these children will be grow up and develop in a safe and loving environment.</p>
