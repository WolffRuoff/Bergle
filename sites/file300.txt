The archive is managed at the University of Michigan and supported by about 780 member institutions, including Muhlenberg College. <em>Who provides the datasets?<\/em> Anyone can submit data for deposit. ICPSR obtains data from private institutions, research agencies, and government entities and then<a href=\"https:\/\/www.icpsr.umich.edu\/icpsrweb\/content\/datamanagement\/index.html\"> curates and stores the datasets<\/a> to ensure data quality and preservation. <em>Why archive data that has already been used?<\/em>  Datasets are a vital part of the evidence that supported the research study results reported to the public.&nbsp; In the ICPSR archive, most datasets are available for public use. Because Muhlenberg College is a member, all data is available to Muhlenberg faculty, students, and staff who create an account using their Muhlenberg email address.  <\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>ICPSR also tracks what research has been done using a dataset from the archive. To find out, search the<a href=\"https:\/\/www.icpsr.umich.edu\/icpsrweb\/ICPSR\/citations\/\"> ICPSR Bibliography of Data-related Literature<\/a> which includes citations to both published and unpublished analytical works using an ICPSR dataset and going back to 1962.
