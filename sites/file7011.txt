								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><u>The Importance of Neurodiversity</u></p>
<p>Neurodiversity is an ideal perspective when working with children who appear to have certain differences and should be crucial for educators to consider. In class, we discuss the discrimination between a difference and a deficit. Most children with Autism, ADHD, or other disorders that impact their performance in a classroom, are viewed as having deficits. The negative connotations that come along with this word not only imply a lack of understanding, but they also breed peer rejection, lowered self-esteem, and impact the efficiency of the child’s learning in the classroom. Neurodiversity, however, is a perspective that promotes difference among children and the ways in which they learn. By using the term difference instead, we imply that the child’s disorder is not something to be fixed or seen as abnormal, but instead accept the differences in the various ways children learn and interact with their peers. So, for example, if a child struggles with social withdrawal, it won’t be seen as a problem but instead can be used to individualize the student’s learning. This particular child may work better on personal, precise tasks rather than activities where tasks are divided and shared by various group members. In today’s society, as we work towards a more accepting world, neurodiversity is actually becoming more widely considered. In class, we discussed various careers that would suit our own strengths and weaknesses. Whether you are diagnosed with some sort of intellectual disorder or not, everyone has their own weaknesses and positive qualities that would make them a better fit for certain jobs.  This idea of finding the ideal working style and atmosphere for the individual is called niche construction, which is a concept discussed alongside neurodiversity. This construction stems from the idea that every individual diagnosed with a disorder actually needs to find an environment in which they can thrive. For example, a person with lower functioning autism may thrive while completing individual financial work in a cubicle but may struggle working as a salesman at a car dealership. Niche construction is all about finding outlets and atmospheres which allow the individual to use their own personal strengths in order to be successful. This same idea can also be applied in a classroom setting, however sometimes it can be more difficult because teachers must work with multiple children at a time. As a whole, our society can work on accepting and using some of these concepts in order to give children and individuals with these disorders appropriate opportunity to succeed.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Neurodiversity is a perspective that the human brain is a complex ecosystem made up of many different continuums of skills, on each of which all people have varying degrees of ability. Up to this point, neurological disabilities were often thought of within the disease perspective, focusing on the dysfunction of a person. Neurodiversity offers a contrasting view of disability, defining it by the difficulties a person has fitting into society, rather than regarding differences as deficits within a person. In other words, when thinking about disabilities, context is key; whether or not they have a disability, each person has their strengths and weaknesses, and although they may not have much to offer in some situations, they may thrive in others. For example, the DSM-V lists social withdrawal as a deficit of a person with autism spectrum disorder, which certainly does get in their way when confronted with tasks that necessitate social interaction. However, if someone with autism has a job that requires many hours of individual work, social withdrawal may give them a leg up over their “neurotypical” coworkers, who may struggle with the isolation.</p>
<p>This begs the question, how can we, as educators and caretakers apply the less-stigmatizing neurodiversity perspective to ensure the success of children with intellectual disabilities? The answer is to help them with a process which all of us engage in called “niche construction.” For example, I have always found math much more difficult than other subjects in school, and as a result I have chosen not to major in mathematics in college in an attempt to ensure my success and begin to create my niche. Similarly, we must help children with intellectual disabilities to find the situations in which they can be successful. Although it is still important to help develop the skills that a child with a disability struggles with, it is equally important to allow them to develop and even to focus on those which they excel at. By focusing on strengths as well as weaknesses, we can improve the confidence of children with this population, and help them to integrate into society within a niche that suits them.</p>
