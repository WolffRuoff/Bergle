These letters often contain accounts of battles, life in camp, and general news. But many soldiers, as they marched off to face the enemy, had left behind a wife or sweetheart, and to them they would compose sweet, poignant, and occasionally funny letters that give life and personality to the participants in this great national conflict. The Special Collections Department holds many Civil War era (1861-1865) manuscript collections, several of which include letters written by soldiers to their loves, and a few from the ladies to their soldiers. These letters show their sorrows of being apart, fears that the soldier would not return home, and hopes for the future after the war&#8217;s end.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><em><strong>Calendar of Events<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>4\/29<\/strong>\u00a0&#8211; South Mountain Middle School Library Scavenger Hunt (part of &#8220;college experience&#8221; day) (Information Commons, 9:45 a.m.-11:45 a.m.)<\/p>\n<p><strong>4\/29<\/strong>\u00a0&#8211; Muhlenberg College Digital Commons Inaugural Reception (level A, 1:00 p.m. &#8211; 2:00 p.m.)<\/p>\n<p><strong>5\/6<\/strong>\u00a0&#8211; Trexler Library Annual Book Sale (library front steps, 9:00 a.m. &#8211; 5:00 p.m.)<\/p>\n<p><strong>5\/10<\/strong>\u00a0&#8211; Copyright, Education, and You: Duke U. attorney Kevin Smith address the subject of academic copyright in all its variety.
