Retrieved from <a href="http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/industry/legal-and-management/vice-president-joe-biden-calls-piracy-outright-1005136622.story">http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/industry/legal-and-management/vice-president-joe-biden-calls-piracy-outright-1005136622.story</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://images1.variety.com/graphics/photos/_storypics/biden_joe_piracy.jpg" alt="" width="175" height="117" />Stricter copyright laws may be looming, if comments by Vice President Joe Biden are any indication. In an <a href="http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/industry/legal-and-management/vice-president-joe-biden-calls-piracy-outright-1005136622.story">interview</a> with the Hollywood trade magazine <em><a href="http://www.variety.com/Home/">Variety</a></em>, he took a personal stand against piracy (both music and movies), calling it “outright theft.” Industry executives are hopeful that this strong language indicates that Washington is willing to push through new regulations on streaming and downloading despite other drastically more important issues that the White House and Congress should be tackling instead.</p>
<p><span id="more-1145"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to Billboard, Biden’s statements leave “little doubt about where the White House stands on piracy.” This is ridiculous, of course. One of the cardinal rules of politics is to leave a little bit of doubt about your position on everything to avoid those embarrassing “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read_my_lips:_no_new_taxes">read my lips, no new taxes</a>” moments. Biden does this, clumsily, by hinting that the entertainment industry isn’t devoting enough resources to educating the public about piracy. Recording industry executives, however, salivate every time someone in the authority role publicly takes their side. This is because industry people fully understand how important the authority power role is to their business.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s no secret that the recording industry spends more time suing consumers in court than actually producing decent music for those consumers to buy (or steal). And the industry’s success in the courtroom depends crucially on their lobbying success in Washington. Biden’s interview with <em>Variety</em> comes at a time when the White House is busy <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/ip_white_paper.pdf">drafting revisions to U.S. copyright law</a> that will strongly favor the recording industry. First on the block: unauthorized music streaming, the mainstay of facilitators like <a href="http://listen.grooveshark.com">Grooveshark</a>, which the new rules may officially prohibit for the first time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Producers within the recording industry have argued for stricter downloading and streaming rules for years. The industry’s main facilitator, the <a href="http://riaa.org/physicalpiracy.php">RIAA</a>, plasters its website with the <a href="http://riaa.org/physicalpiracy.php">scary numbers behind piracy</a>: $12.5 billion in lost revenue every year, $2.7 billion in lost worker earnings, and 71,060 lost jobs. The money the labels make from sucking their own “artists” dry through exploitative contracts may help lessen this impact, especially if they start passing some of their ill-gotten earnings from their major executives’ pockets to their “workers.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ironically, the ones really feeling the kick of illegal downloading are the exhibitors. The operators of Borders, Barnes and Noble, and Wal-Mart stores are the ones whose pockets you’re actually stealing from when you download <a href="http://rebeccablackonline.com/">Rebecca Black</a>’s new album from Pirate Bay instead of purchasing it. Whether or not the record companies will start sharing any new revenue generated from increased enforcement of copyright laws with artists and exhibitors remains to be seen, but it’s highly unlikely.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ultimately, the recording industry will probably pressure Washington into passing stricter copyright rules. The bulk of the politicians’ electorate—old people—couldn’t care less about music downloading laws, and the people most affected by it—Generation Y—are generally politically disengaged and/or powerless. In a time when arguments about funding for Social Security and international wars are threatening to shut down the government, a new copyright law is an easy pass, and this one will probably slip through Congress unnoticed. The impact it will have on each person’s individual music experience, however, is still uncertain.</p>

(22 February 2011). Interscope&#8217;s Jimmy Iovine fighting the 24-bit fight. <em>Billboard</em>. Retrieved from <a href="http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/industry/digital-and-mobile/interscope-s-jimmy-iovine-fighting-the-24-1005044072.story#">http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/industry/digital-and-mobile/interscope-s-jimmy-iovine-fighting-the-24-1005044072.story#</a></p>
<p>Forget CDs! The real format war in the recording industry is between 16-bit and 24-bit audio files, and some industry executives are taking the 24-bit side. Interscope CEO Jimmy Iovine and Columbia Records Co-President Rick Rubin are pressuring other labels to start releasing audio files to iTunes in the higher-quality 24-bit format, ostensibly in an effort to improve the user’s experience. Unfortunately for users, the price of the new format may increase along with the quality.</p>
<p><span id="more-921"></span></p>
<p>But which users will buy these new 24-bit files? In a world where CDs still form the bulk of the industry’s profits, it seems silly for industry executives to promote an upgrade from an iTunes file format that nobody’s complaining about. However, it’s not the first format upgrade the industry’s initiated. In fact, the industry aggressively promoted CDs back in the late eighties and ended up with a years-long boom in profits as everyone switched to the new format. Maybe industry executives are hoping to mirror their success with CDs by promoting another “higher-quality” format for which they can charge more.</p>
<p>The future of this plan, however, hinges on Iovine and Rubin’s success in recruiting other industry executives to their side. As producers, both executives worry about their companies’ future profitability, and history shows that every media company promoting its own personal format isn’t conducive to higher profits for anyone. Both surely remember the <a href="http://www.mediacollege.com/video/format/compare/betamax-vhs.html">disastrous VHS-Beta war of the eighties</a>. The industry’s continued existence may rely on multiple producers banding together under one format.</p>
<p>It’s also possible that, after alienating the bulk of their digital fan base with <a href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2008/09/proving-file-sh/">frivolous file-sharing lawsuits</a>, record industry executives like Iovine and Rubin are eager to prove that they’re still on the users’ side. What better way to do this than to don the public advocate hat and pretend that what’s good for the record industry is what’s good for America? After all, the higher-quality music may enrich users’ overall experience—and would probably sound <em>great</em> under some of Iovine’s <a href="http://www.beatsbydre.com/">“Beats by Dre” line headphones</a>!</p>
<p>The real linchpin in this scheme is, of course, <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/">Apple</a>. Industry executives can release music in any format they want, but Apple’s software and devices need to play them. As music distribution and exhibition responsibilities pass from “one-stops” to iTunes, Apple’s cooperation becomes a crucial component of any business strategy in the music industry. Iovine is working with Apple and says they’ve been “great,” which must be the new euphemism for “greedy.” Everyone who understands Apple knows they won’t agree to reconfigure their software and devices to run a new, higher-priced format without reconfiguring the way they manage profits from sales of that new, higher-priced music. Financial details are sketchy, but with industry executives and Apple executives (is there a difference anymore?) on either end of the bargaining table, the negotiations should be intense.</p>
<p>The real issue, however, revolves around whether music fans care more about quality of music or convenience of access. Another executive at Sony pointed out that users historically care more about convenience. And as every Internet user knows, accessing music online has never been more convenient. If a new 24-bit format became standard right now, it’s likely that the only major change would be more 24-bit files on <a href="http://thepiratebay.org/">Pirate Bay</a>.</p>
<p>Maybe industry executives should focus on getting people to pay for the existing 16-bit format before promoting new digital formats.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Herrera, M. (31 January 2011). Eminem to star in Super Bowl claymation ad: Report.  <em>Billboard</em>.  Retrieved from <a href="http://www.billboard.com/search/?keyword=eminem#/news/eminem-to-star-in-super-bowl-claymation-1005016312.story">http://www.billboard.com/search/?keyword=eminem#/news/eminem-to-star-in-super-bowl-claymation-1005016312.story</a></p>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://imagecache.blastro.com/images/feat/eminem.jpg" alt="" width="181" height="113" /></p>
<p>Lipton Brisk Iced Tea has a treat for Super Bowl ad enthusiasts this year: Eminem in Claymation! The rapper allegedly landed an appearance in Lipton’s $1 million ad spot, set to air during the February 6th game, which features a clay version of him going through “a day in the life” of a superstar. The Claymation theme harks back to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-g8opm1ZmY&amp;playnext=1&amp;list=PL3AEE3D248A17A481">a classic Lipton ad campaign that once featured Frank Sinatra</a>.</p>
<p><span id="more-719"></span></p>
<p>Eminem’s participation in the ad reveals the continuing attempts at synergy between the sound recording industry and the television advertising departments of major companies like Lipton. It especially represents the sound recording industry’s attempt to nab its own piece of the Super Bowl revenue pie. Advertisers realized long ago that the Super Bowl’s ability to reach multiple demographics—a rare ability indeed in this era of fragmented cable audiences—makes the mega-million-dollar ad spaces worth the price. The sound recording industry, in turn, can exploit the advertisers’ need for celebrity endorsements to give their ads that extra pizazz. Clay Eminem drinks some clay tea for Lipton and Lipton gets Eminem (and his new album) in front of the 18-34 audience. Everyone wins. This has been going on since (and long before) <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8qtsUaoVak&amp;feature=related">Madonna teamed up with Pepsi during the 1980s to release her “Like a Prayer” video</a>. The fact that everyone remembers that ad testifies to the strategy’s potential.</p>
<p>Lurking somewhere behind all these joint sound recording-television ventures is a person or persons who are serving what Turow would call “linking pin” roles. These are the people who try to “link” someone or something from one medium (in this case, sound recording) to another (in this case, television). Since Eminem owns his own record label, he’s almost certainly in full promo mode for his new album, <em>Relapse</em>, through traditional sound recording channels like radio and new ones like iTunes. However, the Super Bowl ad offers a vastly expanded audience and possibly access to new TV-watching fans. In the new Information Age, artists who <em>don’t</em> venture into media outside of their industries are already behind.</p>
<p>Indeed, Eminem’s “linking pins” (which may include himself) have been hard at work even outside of preparing a Super Bowl ad appearance. In addition to television, he’s apparently eying a film role in an upcoming DreamWorks picture.</p>
<p>Why all this branching out in the music industry? While recording artists are no strangers to working within the television and film worlds, some of the recent expansion into other media may reflect concerns about illegal downloading. New file sharing outfits seem to pop up faster than the record labels can file lawsuits against them. The possibility of decreasing profit potential within the traditional sound recording industry may motivate artists like Eminem to explore work in other media industries and to seek new advertising opportunities.</p>
<p>Only time will tell how successful these explorations will be for the future of the sound recording industry.</p>
