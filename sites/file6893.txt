								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">More children are being diagnosed with mental health issues than ever before. The rates in which children are being diagnosed with bipolar spectrum disorder alone has risen exponentially in the past 20 years. What could be the cause? There are likely a multitude of factors to explain the increase. Some of these factors being improved recognition, better insurance coverage for major mental illnesses, decreased stigma, assignment when a diagnosis is ambiguous and a wider utilization of the medical model of Bipolar Spectrum Disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5th ed.Text Revision (Danner et al, 2009). Adults with the disorder have recurrent and cyclical mood episodes which varies from person to person. But in children the symptoms may initially look like depression or just typical behavior problems. Because over ⅓-½ of children that have the disorder have some psychotic symptoms it is often misdiagnosed as schizophrenia initially. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I</span><span style="font-weight: 400">n order to help students diagnosed with the disorder to reach their full potential there must be increased awareness among educators and community advocates. Training and education about behaviors that may show up in the classroom can reduce  stigma and negative interactions between pupil and teacher. It will increase empathy and may also help foster better parent/teacher relationships as well. All very important factors that will contribute to the academic and socio-emotional success of a child diagnosed with bipolar spectrum disorder. These children deserve no less.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As we may be aware of, society plays a big role in how the people within that society perceive the world, and therefore the people around them, and how they behave towards those people. In the context of teaching in the U.S., we are prone to societal factors (ie. gender, race, socioeconomic status, and teacher’s level of teaching experience) that influence the ways we teach students. And as research shows, these factors act as moderators in assessing childhood disorders , which could have negative implications in the classroom.</p>
<p>For example, a literature review on the familial role in the development, treatment, and prevention of childhood anxiety disorders showed that “higher levels of parent overcontrol were more strongly related to female gender for the child, higher socioeconomic status, school-aged children, and discussion tasks” (Drake &amp; Ginsburg, 2012). Meaning, parents tend to be more controlling over children if the child has the factors mentioned above. And if we take a closer look at gender, society teaches us -through television, social media, religious place of worship, peer interactions, and so forth- that we should fit into a certain gender and think, perceive, and act in ways that correlate with the assigned gender. In the case of the review, anxiety is induced or exacerbated in a child by the parent controlling (physically and verbally) the behaviors of a girl, because of what the U.S. has taught us about how to dress, act towards particular kinds of men, and play if the child is perceived as a girl.</p>
<p>How does this translate into the classroom? Teachers often exhibit the same kind of over-controlling on students who are girls (ie. telling them to sit a certain way in a seat or at their desk, encouraging them to play with other girls in the classroom, closely watching the girl when around boys), especially if they are diagnosed with a child disorder like Autism Spectrum Disorder or Conduct Disorder, because they are perceived to be or should be ladylike, have better control over emotions as opposed to boys, and be less deviant from the “normal” group of students.</p>
<p>On a different end, my peers and I have observed in our service learning placements that there are more boys than girls in the support classrooms (Autism spectrum or Emotional support). Why are more boys diagnosed with autism? In what ways do boys act that exhibit autism? Or is it the perception of what it means to be a boy that leads the diagnosis? How are they treated differently from girls? Girls with autism? What are some behaviors teachers show towards boys that could influence or reiterate the lack of emotion regulation in boys? These are questions we considered in our discussions and I recommend teachers should as well.</p>
<p>It is important to consider such factors when teaching, because the way we teach matters and strongly influences the behaviors and psyche of a child. Actions exhibited elicit certain child behaviors. Words said and in what order change the child’s point of view. And since children spend just as much time at home at school, if not more, the effects can be deep, pervasive, and long lasting. So questioning our world views and how they shape our teaching, changing how we teach, and teaching and caring for each student with respect to their own personality, ways of learning, and behaviors without the bias of things like gender and race, can make for better humans of the future.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anxiety disorder is hard to diagnose due to its &#8220;hidden&#8221; nature and its ambiguity to those who spend the most time around a child, so most parents and teachers will not notice that their child has symptoms associated with anxiety. The differentiation between the many anxiety disorders is difficult, due to the fact that everyone has a natural anxious response to threats.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When diagnosing anxiety, one of the things clinicians will look at is the hereditary aspect of anxiety. Biological vulnerability to anxiety means that there is an increased risk for formation of an anxiety disorder, when someone has anxiety in the family. This can be explained by increased risk of anxiety to children who have parents who have higher alertness and hypervigilance to their surroundings. I think that understanding that immediate family with anxiety correlates and suggests predispositions for anxiety is really important because it can help us prevent and be aware of warning signs early on in a child’s development. Additionally, anxiety can be a result of overly structured family life (Barrett, Rapee, Dadds, &amp; Ryan 1996), such that “high anxiety in a child is significantly related to frequent negative feedback and parental restriction.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In my outside research, I have found that some specified anxiety disorders are more likely to be considered hereditary than others. Specifically, Torgersen (1983), explains that heredity does not seem to be such a large influencer for generalized anxiety disorder in comparison with other anxiety disorders (panic disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder) or psychiatric disorders. Moreover, the researchers also explains that the interaction between the environment in which one develops and their biology is critical in understanding anxiety disorder. Though, the study doesn’t have enough evidence to draw conclusions. Knowing the effects and contributions that environments can impose on the development of anxiety for children is important, because then it can be controlled and monitored. </span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On the topic of conduct issues, childhood-onset conduct disorders tend to have the more severe consequences, in comparison to adolescence-onset, later in life as the problems such as drug abuse, destruction, and aggression continue through adolescence and adulthood. We talked briefly in class about the gender differences in identification of childhood-onset conduct disorders. The ratio of boys to girls identified is 3:1 and it is known that, “The majority of research on antisocial behavior in youth has focused on the samples of boys, (Frick &amp; Viding, 2009)” because antisocial behaviors, such as aggression, are rarer in girls. I think this topic is interesting as aggression in girls is not the same as aggression in boys, as girls show it in a way that impacts their relationships and relationships of their peers.</p>
<p>I decided to focus on this point to raise the question of whether girls are actually less aggressive, or if their relational aggression (Frick &amp; Viding, 2009) goes unnoticed or unidentified because their aggression is viewed as them being a “mean girl” among their peers. The “mean girl” is seen as normal in society as they are often portrayed in movies and TV shows. Girls may begin to show this relational aggression more in adolescence but if it is continuous, it should not go unattended to as, “… Adolescent girls who largely showed adolescent onset to their antisocial behavior also showed high levels of CU (Callous- unemotional) traits, problems with impulse control, and a number of other social and temperamental vulnerabilities that were more similar to childhood-onset boys than to adolescent-onset boys. Frick &amp; Viding, 2009)”</p>
<p>It is important that when relational aggression behaviors are noticed in girls that they do not be taken lightly, especially if they are continuous. Girls are not “just being girls” sometimes and their actions that may just seem immature and part of normal development can actually be a deeper conduct issue that can have negative consequences for them later in life.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) is often identified and described by its hallmark symptoms: inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. However, those with ADHD don’t always exhibit all three of these symptoms. Because of this, the DSM 5 divides ADHD into four subcategories which are the predominately inattentive type (formerly known as ADD), predominately hyperactive-impulsive type, combined type and inattentive presentation (restrictive). The first two describe the primary symptom that is exhibited by an individual. For example, someone with ADHD of the predominately inattentive type would mostly have issues with paying and sustaining attention, while someone with predominately hyperactive-impulse type would display behaviors such as fidgeting, talking excessively, and interrupting others. Those with combined type have significant amounts of inattentive, hyperactive and impulsive symptoms. The rarest form of ADHD is inattention presentation (restrictive). This means that only symptoms of inattention are exhibited. People with this form of ADHD don’t have any issues with hyperactivity or impulsivity, but instead, exclusively have trouble with attention. This is rare because typically manifests itself as various combinations of symptoms from each of the three main categories. It is important to understand the various types of ADHD in order to better identify and understand it.</p>
<p>Similarly, ADHD often presents itself differently in girls. While boys typically deal with ADHD in more external ways such as blurting out answers and getting out of their seat at times when they should be seated, girls tend to react in more internal ways. This includes mood disorders, school anxiety, social skills deficits, and emotional over-reactivity. Girls are less diagnosed with ADHD than boys, not necessarily because it&#8217;s more common in boys but possibly because the diagnosis is often missed in girls. By understanding how ADHD is often presented in girls, we can better identify it.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Autism Spectrum Disorder is a developmental disability that affects many children as young as two or three years old. Some of the characteristic hallmarks of autism are difficulties with social interactions, language and cognitive delays or difficulties, and restricted, repetitive, and stereotyped behaviors. Every person with autism has a different experience and autism is often described as a wide spectrum. The spectrum is labeled from low functioning to high functioning. People with “low functioning” autism are usually described as having more severe symptoms while people with “high functioning” autism are described as having less severe symptoms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There are many issues with the way we label autism and the way we classify and categorize people with autism. Although the concept of a spectrum is helpful in understanding autism, oftentimes people with autism do not fit neatly onto the spectrum and this may be extremely frustrating for them. There are a multitude of symptoms and differing severity of each symptom that create a different combination for each person who is diagnosed with autism. It is almost as if there is a spectrum for each symptom and each person with autism fits onto each spectrum in their own way. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I believe thinking of autism in this way makes it much easier for people to try and understand what having autism is truly like. Of course, people without the disorder will never fully understand what it is like for people with it. That being said, it is important for the general population to try their best to be informed and accommodating in order to have a fuller understanding of what people with autism experience. </span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>An overview of child maltreatment:</strong> This week in class we discussed child maltreatment, including abuse and neglect. The Center for Disease Control (CDC) defines child abuse and neglect as “any act or series of acts of commission or omission by a parent or other caregiver (e.g., clergy, coach, teacher) that results in harm, potential for harm, or threat of harm to a child.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Acts of Commission (Abuse):</strong> The CDC defines acts of abuse as “words or overt actions that cause harm, potential harm, or threat of harm. Acts of commission are deliberate and intentional.” It is important to note the wording of this definition. In regard to <em>intention</em>: intention only applies to the actions of the caregiver, and not the consequences of the actions. For example: a parent hits a child as a form of punishment (the action of hitting is <em>intentional</em> and not accidental), but the hitting is not intended to cause the child to have a black eye.</p>
<p><strong>Types of Abuse: </strong></p>
<p>Physical Abuse– e.g., hitting, punching</p>
<p>Sexual Abuse– e.g., inappropriate touching, groping, non-consensual sexual actions</p>
<p>Psychological Abuse– e.g., abuse that can cause emotional harm, such as verbal threats</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Acts of Omission (Neglect):</strong> The CDC defines child neglect as the “failure to provide needs or to protect from harm or potential harm.” Similar to acts of commission, actual harm to the child may not be the intended consequence.</p>
<p><strong>Types of Neglect: </strong></p>
<p><strong>Failure to Provide:</strong></p>
<p>Physical Neglect – e.g., not giving the child enough food, appropriate clothing</p>
<p>Emotional Neglect – e.g., not providing the child with adequate love, attention, and affection</p>
<p>Medical/ Dental Neglect – e.g., failure to bring the child to the doctor when sick, not bringing the child in for regular shots or check-ups</p>
<p>Educational Neglect – e.g., not providing necessary tools to complete school work such as pencils, preventing child from attending school</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Failure to Supervise:</strong></p>
<p>Inadequate Supervision – e.g., leaving a child alone in a hot car, leaving a child alone for too long</p>
<p>Exposure to Violent Environments – e.g., child is privy to domestic violence, organized crime</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In 2016, there were 676,000 victims of child abuse and neglected that were <em>reported </em>to Child Protective Services (CPS)</li>
<li>80% of the perpetrators of the abuse were parents</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How you can help:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Mandated Reporters: individuals, by law, that must report any <em>suspicion</em> of child abuse/neglect to CPS. A mandated reporter is any individual that provides care to a child. Mandated Reporter Laws vary from state to state (see link below).</li>
<li>Even if you are not a mandated reporter, it is important to report any suspicion of potential child abuse/neglect. Remember, when you report something, you are not responsible for investigating the case, therefore, the responsibility leaves your hands once you make a report.</li>
<li>Call <strong>911</strong> if you believe the child is in immediate danger.</li>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Child maltreatment can be defined as the intentional or reckless doing of any physical, emotional, or mental harm to a child. Examples of child maltreatment include, but are not limited to: bodily injury, serious physical neglect of a child, fabricating or the intentionally exaggerating of a medical symptom or disease, sexual abuse or exploitation of a child, etc. In Pennsylvania, the Child Protective Services Law was passed to protect children from abuse, allow the opportunity for healthy growth and development, as well as preserve and stabilize the family. The abuse is considered recent if it happened within a two-year range of when the report is made to ChildLine, however, there is no time limit for sexual abuse, serious mental injury, serious physical neglect and deaths. A few examples of people who can be considered perpetrators of child abuse are: a parent, a person who is 14 years of age or older that is responsible for the welfare of the child, a relative in same home as the child (or not) who is 18 years old or older. Mandatory reporters do not have to determine if a person is or isn’t meeting the criteria of a perpetrator to make a report. You are considered a mandatory reported (and required to report suspected child abuse) if you are: licensed or certified in any health-related field, a medical examiner, an employee of a health care facility who is engaged with the child, a school employee, or the employee of a child-care service who has direct contact with the child, just to name a few. Mandatory reporters must make a report if they have reasonable cause to suspect that a child is/had experienced child abuse and if they: are directly responsible for the care or training of the child (or work for an agency that does this), or a person makes a disclosure to the reporter. Abuse can also be reported to ChildLine or a county youth agency if there are concerns for the general safety and wellbeing of the child such as inadequate clothing, housing or supervision. Reports of suspected child abuse can be submitted to ChildLine’s website (<a href="http://www.compass.state.pa.us/cwis)">www.compass.state.pa.us/cwis)</a>or by calling 1-800-932-0313.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Autism Spectrum Disorder</span></p>
<p>This week in class, we focused on Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). In 2013 the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) released it&#8217;s 5th edition (DSM-5).  In the DSM-5 they labeled ASD as the umbrella term that is used to diagnose a series of developmental disorders. A developmental disorder is a disorder that manifests challenges in nonverbal communication, speech, and social interaction In addition to relabeling ASD they revised which disorders fall under the spectrum. However, many psychologists argue if the classifications in the DSM-5 were correct. Especially when it involves Asperger&#8217;s Syndrome.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What is Asperger&#8217;s Syndrome?</span></p>
<p>Asperger&#8217;s Syndrome, also synonymous with High-Functioning Autism, is a developmental disorder that is primarily characterized by difficulty in social interactions; this includes challenges with understanding emotions, the &#8220;give and take&#8221; of conversation, and nonverbal communication (i.e. speaking from a distance, tone,  and volume). The challenges with social interactions are right in line with Autism. However, according to the previous DSM system, with Asperger&#8217;s there is no significant language or cognitive delay when it comes to Asperger&#8217;s. In fact people with Asperger&#8217;s tend to have remarkable focus, pay great attention to detail, and may excel in fields such as engineering, accounting, and mathematics to name a few.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The debate</span></p>
<p>When the DSM-5 was released in 2013 many psychologists were shocked to learn that Asperger&#8217;s Syndrome was being characterized under ASD. Primarily that Asperger&#8217;s misses a crucial criteria of there not being a significant delay in speech. Plus, Asperger&#8217;s is noticed a lot later compared to Autism because it&#8217;s challenges in social situations not speech. Many psychologists argue that Asperger&#8217;s should still have it&#8217;s on classification in the DSM-5 because it is not a social anxiety disorder, but it also doesn&#8217;t quite meet the qualifications to be Autism.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">So what is it?</span></p>
<p>Is it a disability, is it a disorder, or is it just a difference?</p>
<p>A 2002 article by Simon Baron-Cohen attempted to answer this question. According to Baron-Cohen The it depends on which model you want to use to look at it. Psychologists can approach Asperger&#8217;s from the systemizing-empathizing model. In this it looks at the systemize and empathy aspects of Asperger&#8217;s and how that translates to our society. If you look at it from the systemizing portion (where a person&#8217;s strength is understanding &#8216;things&#8217;); Asperger&#8217;s leans more toward that of a disability because our society strives on the idea that people are to be social. People with Asperger&#8217;s tend to shy away from social interactions due to not being able to understanding certain cues. However, if we look at it from the empathy angle (&#8216;understanding people&#8217;), we can understand that people with Asperger&#8217;s have trouble understanding reading people; which can be difficult for anyone, but it is no need for alarm. Mainly because the only reason people with Asperger&#8217;s are seem as &#8216;abnormal&#8221; is because of they have a deficit in the empathizing dimension. Even so people with Asperger&#8217;s can still function and flourish in society. All it takes is being put into the right environment.</p>
<p>Sadly, for treatment and insurance purposes you would need to classify it as a disability or disorder.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Why is it important?</span></p>
<p>This debate is important because it shows us what improvements can be made to ending the stigma surrounding not only Asperger&#8217;s but ASD. We focus so heavily on this need to classify people into categories of &#8216;normal&#8217; and &#8216;abnormal&#8217;, all while forgetting that these are people we&#8217;re referring to. It is ironic that this field is one of the main causes in the growth of stigma, because to provide treatment we need to provide the answer. Yes, it could also technically be the fault of insurance companies needing a diagnosis in order to treat, but that doesn&#8217;t mean it is right. From here we need to look at ways at classifying without creating more harm to people.</p>
<p>Personally, this topic is close to my heart as someone close to me has Asperger&#8217;s. Yes they exhibit most of the signs: misunderstanding social cues, trouble with nonverbal communication (especially distance), but they excel in mathematics and computer engineering. Had it not been made known that this person has Asperger&#8217;s you would never have known because he functions just like you and me, holds conversations (sometimes too many), and goes about his own business. At most you maybe would have thought he was a little awkward in social situations. As this is something I encounter frequently I understand how easy it is to take the challenges at face value and place it on the disorder. By doing so we minimize the person.;which just adds to the stereotype and stigma.</p>
<p>In conclusion the take away from this is that as a society we need to remember that <strong>people are not defined by their disorders.</strong></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><u>The Importance of Neurodiversity</u></p>
<p>Neurodiversity is an ideal perspective when working with children who appear to have certain differences and should be crucial for educators to consider. In class, we discuss the discrimination between a difference and a deficit. Most children with Autism, ADHD, or other disorders that impact their performance in a classroom, are viewed as having deficits. The negative connotations that come along with this word not only imply a lack of understanding, but they also breed peer rejection, lowered self-esteem, and impact the efficiency of the child’s learning in the classroom. Neurodiversity, however, is a perspective that promotes difference among children and the ways in which they learn. By using the term difference instead, we imply that the child’s disorder is not something to be fixed or seen as abnormal, but instead accept the differences in the various ways children learn and interact with their peers. So, for example, if a child struggles with social withdrawal, it won’t be seen as a problem but instead can be used to individualize the student’s learning. This particular child may work better on personal, precise tasks rather than activities where tasks are divided and shared by various group members. In today’s society, as we work towards a more accepting world, neurodiversity is actually becoming more widely considered. In class, we discussed various careers that would suit our own strengths and weaknesses. Whether you are diagnosed with some sort of intellectual disorder or not, everyone has their own weaknesses and positive qualities that would make them a better fit for certain jobs.  This idea of finding the ideal working style and atmosphere for the individual is called niche construction, which is a concept discussed alongside neurodiversity. This construction stems from the idea that every individual diagnosed with a disorder actually needs to find an environment in which they can thrive. For example, a person with lower functioning autism may thrive while completing individual financial work in a cubicle but may struggle working as a salesman at a car dealership. Niche construction is all about finding outlets and atmospheres which allow the individual to use their own personal strengths in order to be successful. This same idea can also be applied in a classroom setting, however sometimes it can be more difficult because teachers must work with multiple children at a time. As a whole, our society can work on accepting and using some of these concepts in order to give children and individuals with these disorders appropriate opportunity to succeed.</p>
