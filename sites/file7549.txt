								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since technology has always been a part of my life, I have never stopped to reflect on the impact it has had on my life. Although I am not sure if the implications are positive or negative, I know I would not have the same interests today if technology wasn’t a player.</p>
<p>My earliest memories of technology are playing with my Leapster and reading from my LeapPad. The Leapster was an educational gaming system, on which I remember playing a dog game. The player would have to take care of the dogs by doing math problems. As a math major, I see that this could be where my love for math roots from. The LeapPad was a device that you could attach books to, and it would read them to you and have activities about the book at the end. I now understand why I liked my LeapPad so much—I am an auditory learner, and often listen to audiobooks.</p>
<p>Like many other children, I loved watching TV. My favorite show growing up was <i>Blues Clues</i>, where a dog named Blue would leave clues that would help solve a mystery by the end of the program. I enjoyed the variety of characters and the bright colors used to design them. I also loved to watch princess movies. I would go to the library to take out the VHS of <i>Belle’s Tales of Friendship</i>, watch it everyday, and return it by the three day deadline, just to take it out again the next day.</p>
<p>Years later, I got a phone after my sixth grade graduation, and I find this to be a pivotal point in my technological life since it was my first gateway to communication through technology. It was a Samsung Intensity, which had a slide-out keyboard. I thought having a phone like this would make me &#8220;cool&#8221; amongst my peers, since many of them already had phones. However, I found that the hype was much greater than the actual experience; I did not text people often nor did the phone have Internet capabilities. Yet I found that having a phone provided a false sense of comfort, which I still believe hold today.</p>
<p>It would be four years until I had an iPhone. I got the iPhone 5c (in blue) and I found that it changed my life it many different ways. I had Internet access on the family computer at home, but now i had the Internet in my pocket. My parents put restrictions on my phone, but I had still upgraded from my slide phone. I did not have any social media accounts until I turned 18, but I always watched YouTube. I have always been entertained by a variety of content creators, including comedians, vloggers (video bloggers), dancers, and gymnasts. Watching YouTube often has shifted my time management, and has probably affected my sleep patterns. However, I would never stop watching YouTube because this is where I find creative inspiration.</p>
<p>When I turned 18, I finally logged onto Facebook and Instagram, with intentions of using it to find Muhlenberg students. As expected, it has become much more than that. Now in college, I find that Facebook is one of the best ways to connect with my friends &amp; family. I make sure to also post lots of pictures so others can feel the same sense of connection.</p>
<p>My parents gifted me with a MacBook for college, and I mainly use it to read online articles for coursework and type on the Pages application. Another tool I use is Wolfram Alpha, which is a scholarly form of Google. According to our Technology Survey, I am the only person that answered that I use it (Hertel, 2016). I love Wolfram Alpha, and it is especially useful for math, because sometimes it is hard to get math help on Google. I can imagine that there are apps or websites that I am aware of that are just as useful as Wolfram Alpha that I can someday bring into my technological tool belt.</p>
