<p>Like many students at Muhlenberg, Eirinn Disbrow and Avivah Furman wanted to volunteer to make their world a better place. They quickly realized however, that making a difference was much more difficult than they had thought. Undeterred, they decided to make a documentary about the challenges of volunteerism. The resulting feature, <em>Good Intentions,</em> debuted this past Friday at Muhlenberg&#8217;s Recital Hall.</p>
<p>Supported by a competitive summer research grant from Muhlenberg, Disbrow and Furman joined a group of American students who signed up to volunteer in Costa Rica. They documented their own experiences and those of their colleagues, focusing on the students&#8217; eagerness and occasional naivete. The film, completed with assistance from a number of Media &amp; Comm faculty,  is a compelling account of the challenges that stand between good intentions and successful results.</p>
<p>Disbrow is a Media &amp; Communication major and Creative Writing minor from Wilton, CT. Furman is a Media &amp; Communication and Film Studies major from Hastings-on-Hudson, NY. Both are juniors.</p>
