								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is no secret that in today’s world people have an ever-growing hunger for the newest, the best, and the quickest form of any good/service that exists. This demand for efficiency has subsequently led to the invention of many products that fulfilled such requirements. For example, people did not want to wait three days for a letter to be delivered to its recipient so electronic mail (e-mail) was invented, some people did not want to wait in a ticket booth line on the Turnpike so E-ZPass transponders were manufactured, and students did not feel like manually having to write citations for papers so online citation websites were generated. All of the aforementioned inventions are different and unique in terms of what they provide but similar in their purpose: keeping up with consumers’ mile-a-minute lifestyles. Following suit is banking. The days of actually going to a bank, conversing face to face with a teller, and completing a transaction are soon to be long gone. In their place is electronic banking: the newest, the best, and the quickest way to deposit, withdrawal, or transfer funds. Chapter 7 of <em>The Future of Banking</em> focuses solely on electronic banking. The term “electronic banking” is an umbrella terms that covers any banking activity accessed by electronic means (2002, p 131). To further simplify this concept, note that it includes automated teller machines (ATMs), automated call centers, digital cash, Internet banking, and many other electronic-related forms of banking (2002, p 131).</p>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, electronic banking is not as innovative as it has been made out to be. The first form of electronic banking arose in 1871 when a nationwide money-transfer service was being offered by the Western Union Telegraph Company (2002, p 132). This was then followed by the Fedwire telegraph system in 1918, SWIFT and CHIPs payments systems in the 1970s, and Western Union’s first over-the-Internet services in 2000 (2002, p 132). In between all of these large milestones are more milestones that are smaller than but just as important as their predecessors. Such achievements include the first machine to read checks, credit cards, ATMs, and a multitude of other Internet-based inventions and innovations (2002, p 132). It is undeniable to say that society’s banking ways have made leaps and bounds since their birth 144 years ago. However, what is not so clear to people is if society is still headed in the right path or if it is time to take a break from becoming so obsessed with the need for speed in every aspect of daily life. Despite the extreme convenience of it, is electronic banking posing a number of negative effects on society?</p>
<p>It can be argued that technology is ruining society in a number of different ways. In this instance, electronic banking is affecting society negatively in three major ways. First, the amount of jobs available to people is steadily decreasing. It is predicted that 45% of all jobs will belong to robots within the next two decades (Worstall, 2013). Second, people are becoming dependent on technology. The 188 billion text messages sent monthly in the US alone is an enormous indicator that people have an electronic obsession (Kluger, 2010). Another red flag appears when people are installing devices that make their lives revolve around technology now more than ever (Kluger, 2010). The final reason that electronic banking has adverse effects is the lost amount of face-to-face interaction between people. The assumption of believing that closing banks is not significant because it is just “one job,” is beyond false due to the fact that there are a number of jobs that are similarly being eliminated which add up and become an enormous issue for society to deal with. Nowadays, on average, people only have 74 face-to-face conversations a month (Narins, 2013). Closing banks and other like-businesses will only cause this statistic to become even worse. Although Gup refers to electronic banking as “innovative,” “faster,” “better,” and “cheaper” it is safe to say that he is wrong (2002, p 133). With the continued support and advancement of electronic banking and other technology-based substitutes, society as a whole will be hurt more than they will be helped.</p>
