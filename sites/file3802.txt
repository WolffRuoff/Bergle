								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rhoads, Eric. (2011, February 3.) Radio Always Gets Through When Others Cannot. Media Biz Bloggers. Retrieved from <a href="http://www.mediabizbloggers.com/eric-rhoads/115099564.htm">http://www.mediabizbloggers.com/eric-rhoads/115099564.htm</a>l.</p>
<p>Americans are beginning to rely more on their local radio stations for updates and information that will help notify them on what to do, what precautions to take, and how these intense winter months are going to affect them.  This is a huge step up for local stations due to the fact that the growing technologies of the internet and television have been taking the place of local radio&#8217;s abilities to give their communities the news.  But, from the start of these brutal winter weeks, communities have come together through their radio.  When every other way of communicating is diminished due to the severe weather, such as power outages, households being snowed in, wireless connectors crashing etc., radios still can be powered simply by the use of batteries.</p>
<p><span id="more-739"></span></p>
<p>Radio network teams are braving the storms to give their local communities information during this time of &#8220;weather chaos&#8221;.  These stations are becoming &#8220;media lifelines&#8221; for those communities that are being the most affected by these intense storms.  These local &#8220;teams of radio soldiers&#8221; are all coming together to gather up information that will help their communities and staying on the radio in 48 hour shifts.  This dedication shows that the radio industries will always be able to support American communities with staying on air to give important information that is always needed.  Rhoads says, &#8220;Moments like this define radio, and these are the times when station loyalties are solidified as consumers find radio is their lifeline to their communities.&#8221;  The importance of local radio stations is shown through times like these.</p>
<p>What is even the point of caring about local radio stations for just this one winter?  Although it seems as though local radio stations aren&#8217;t deemed as popular as stations that are on the Internet, satellite radio, or HD and digital radio, communities, and the radio industry itself, may be beginning to see, and appreciate more, the importance that local radio stations has for giving communities importance information when other media outlets cannot.</p>
<p>Citizens can rely on their radio stations because they know these stations care about them.  This realization further justifies the title of this article that radio always gets through when others cannot.</p>
