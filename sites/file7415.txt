								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span lang="EN-US">When we talk about the 21 century, people will say: “oh, it’s an electronic information age.” and this fact is obviously. Nowadays, it’s very normal to see a 4-year-old child and a grandpa use IPAD to play “the angry bird”. But as a part of this electronic age, do we own something? Or in the other word, do we own our domains? “When it comes to all our digital data, the answer to the question “what you own” is probably “not much”. You do not own your Amazon Kindle books; you’ve purchased a license to access the content. Your heir will not inherit your digital reading library. You do not own the music you stream……” (Watters, 2016) Maybe someone will say we can print the images we posted in our Facebook. But who will actually do these things—print our self-portraits so that we can save them and pass to our heirs. Actually, few people will go back and see what they posted in the past.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">If we don’t have the domain of our own, who have? The company likes Google? Just like the example given by Jim Groom in discussion, though it’s free to everyone to use the Gmail, we actually pay it by the given of our personal information. Or the government, or none, or, from another perceptive, everyone can own your domains! We all know everything we posted in the net can be seen by public and everyone can own our images. What’s worse is that even we posted nothing in the Facebook, people may also own our images because our relatives or friends posted them in their Facebook. So we can easily image that, with the further development of science and technology, in the future, everyone can know everything about others including the kind of pens they use, the clothes they wear, and even the money they </span><span lang="EN-US">have</span><span lang="EN-US">…… Seems like the video “Scary Pizza” we watched in class discussion. Although the situation show in the video will not happen today, we should reflect on our own. Do I use the internet in a safety way, or what we can do to protect ourselves in a more and more complex network environment?</span></p>
