								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>McClintock, Pamela. (2011, March 15). Why Disney&#8217;s &#8216;Mars Needs Moms&#8217; bombed. <em>The Hollywood Reporter</em>. Retrieved from http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/why-disneys-mars-needs-moms-167551.<a href="http://mediaindustries11.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/03/images.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-949" src="http://mediaindustries11.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/03/images.jpg" alt="" width="177" height="245" /></a></p>
<p>On Friday, March 11, Disney unveiled its latest animated theatrical release, the 3D motion-capture film &#8220;Mars Needs Moms.&#8221; The film was a production of the animation company ImageMovers, whose past works have included box office successes such as &#8220;The Polar Express&#8221; (2004) and &#8220;A Christmas Carol&#8221; (2009). Headed by acclaimed director Robert Zemeckis, ImageMovers specializes in a type of technology known as performance capture. This technology involves shooting films as if they&#8217;re live action and then converting them to animation in post-production. After the worldwide success of &#8220;The Polar Express,&#8221; Disney acquired ImageMovers in 2007, with hopes of imprinting its brand on part of their animated division. &#8220;Mars Needs Moms,&#8221; a story of a young boy who must battle against Martians after they have kidnapped his mother, is the company&#8217;s latest release. However, Disney&#8217;s hopes for financial success with the film were dashed when it took in a miniscule $6.9 million opening weekend, despite expensive 3D surcharges associated with ticket prices. With a budget of over $200 million including production and marketing expenses, Disney will now likely be swimming in red ink trying to recover costs of the ill-fated production.<span id="more-948"></span></p>
<p>In the weeks leading up to the film&#8217;s release, tracking figures had suggested that the film would not be a blockbuster and had tepid interest at best. However, Disney was still unprepared for the shockingly low figures that came in last weekend. According to <em>The Hollywood Reporter</em>, &#8220;<em>Mars </em>was always designed to open in the $20-30 million range. When tracking showed the film was in serious trouble, Disney downgraded its forecast. As the toon opened, Disney braced themselves for a $10 million opening. Even that turned out to be too optimistic.&#8221; Despite their disappointment at the film&#8217;s disastrous opening weekend, Disney may have had an inkling they would lose money on it. In March 2010, after first screening &#8220;Mars Needs Moms,&#8221; Disney dropped their association with ImageMovers. Still, Disney decided to release the film theatrically instead of shelving it completely or trying to sell the film&#8217;s distribution rights to another studio. It is likely Disney did this because they thought it would be more cost-effective to release the film themselves and simply cut future losses by eliminating their ties with ImageMovers.</p>
<p>In terms of the recent development of motion capture animation, ImageMovers perhaps had hoped their technology alone would suffice as a selling point for audiences. This rang true for &#8220;The Polar Express,&#8221; which was the first major motion picture to capitalize on the motion capture technology. Although there were other factors associated with that film&#8217;s popularity, such as a magical Christmas theme and the presence of actor Tom Hanks, the technology itself also likely contributed to the film&#8217;s success because it was considered revolutionary at the time. With &#8220;Mars Needs Moms,&#8221; however, the film&#8217;s technology was hardly promoted in its advertising, there was no star power associated with the film, and its awkward title likely turned off many viewers, especially the target audience of young boys. &#8220;The title shouldn&#8217;t have been &#8220;Mars Needs Moms,&#8221; but &#8220;Boys Need Not Come,&#8221; said an anonymous studio executive quoted in <em>The Hollywood Reporter</em>. Furthermore, the financial misfire of &#8220;Mars Needs Moms&#8221; comes on the heels of other space-related children&#8217;s pictures that also saw poor box office returns. Summit Entertainment&#8217;s 2009 film &#8220;Astro Boy&#8221; ($19.6 million total) and 20th Century Fox&#8217;s 2009 film &#8220;Aliens in the Attic&#8221; ($25.2 million total) did not provide encouraging results for films with this type of subject matter, and &#8220;Mars Needs Moms&#8221; has continued the unprofitable trend. If studios make an effort to revive the motion capture technology, despite Disney breaking its association with it, they may need to go back to the drawing board in order to create products that audiences actually want to see.</p>
