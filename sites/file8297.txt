					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m shocked. The history of the selfie is quite remarkable and has evolved so much. I can&#039;t even believe it was that long ago when the first selfie was taken. I wonder who came up with the name. The amount of selfies taken per day is an insane number and one could only expect it to increase even more over the next few years. I think the recent increase in social media networks has had a direct impact on the increase of selfies taken. Without the boom of social media, I don&#039;t think taking selfies would be nearly as popular as they are.&lt;/p&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I agree. Selfies have become a huge part of western culture. If you think about it the idea of selfies someone probably thought it would be cool to take a picture of yourself even before 1839. Selfies have evolved so much in the last couple years.&lt;/p&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I found this post really interesting because prior to reading this, if someone would have asked me when I thought the first selfie was taken, 1839 would have probably been my last guess. Nevertheless, almost 200 years later, selfies are beyond popular in today&#039;s society. Some businesses exist because of the phenomenon; the selfie stick being one of the biggest contender in the pro-selfie business (I reluctantly admit that I have one but I only use it as a joke and to take big group pictures).&lt;/p&gt;
