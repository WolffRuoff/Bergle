								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As society is evolving so is social medias language. Through the internet people have discovered new ways to communicate easily while not actually having to use full coherent sentences. Chapter six in <em>How Blogs and Twitter Ate Transforming Popular Culture </em>written by Mary Cross, she states “Without editors or gatekeepers, language on the Internet is in constant flux, experimental at best, ungrammatical at worst” (2011, p 85). Visual information gets to the brain a lot faster so social media has been able to translate words and emotions into emoticons. Through emoticons one is able to express their emotions and thoughts to friends or family in a quick and easy to understand manner. It is very hard for people to read a tone text message, you may send a message with a joking tone but the receivers might take it the wrong way and think you were being rude or overly sarcastic. With emotions and expressions being translated into emoticons it makes it easier for people to be able to get a sense of the text messages tone because a quick smiley face at the end of the sentence can go along way.</p>
<p>A huge theme that is constantly changing over the years is the use of slang words. As culture evolves so does slang, there will always be more words that are “in” during that year. This year specifically those words consisted of “no chill”, “FOMO”, “turnt”, “on fleek”, “bae”, “yas”, and many more. There have been people looking into whether or not slang effects the way one writes essays and complete assignments but some say other wise, “Yet experts who study these things say that language offline has not ben measurably affected, that students can still put together coherent papers in full sentences, and, even, that all the extra writing they are doing online is improving their mastery of written langue” (2011, p 86). Even thought students these days use slang more often than not it has not yet effect our ability to write properly. It is important that as our culture changes we do not begin slipping away from the English grammar and spelling, we cannot let slang take over the English dictionary.</p>
<p>Chapter six also touches upon a major theme in that there is a difference between the male language and female language. In regard to the use of emoticons and slang females tend to have more length texts apply more emoticons where as males tend to be more short and to the point with less use of emoticons. On a more serious note when it comes to proper English and professional writings there were specific difference brought to my attention through this chapter. Linguistics professor Naomi S Baron, who is the author of <em>Always on </em>states that, “Women also tend to use more qualifiers, are more polite, stick to standard usage, and use conversation to enhance social interactions, while men converse to convey information” (2011, p 90). Over all I agree with this statement however I do not believe that men only talk to convey information, I feel as though women are more polite than men by using conversation to interact but men also do that too, just not as often. Baron also touches upon the fact that women tend to disguise themselves online so that they are able to speak out loud with out getting bashed on the internet however this is not what women should have to do to speak their mind.</p>
<p>Again as society begins to develop so does our language, so it is important that we do not let slang get in the way of being professional students nor let society gender norms hold you back from expressing our own thoughts to the public.</p>
