<p>Our Observations:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Grafton Street is a popular attraction for both tourists and Irish citizens alike. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Paved and pedestrian-only, it has a unique atmosphere with top quality shops, flower stands, and buskers along the route. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Throughout the busy street, you can find people shopping, chatting, meeting up with friends and simply taking in the vibrant scene. Located in center city Dublin, Grafton street runs from St. Stephens to college green, only a short walk from the Temple Bar District as well as Trinity College. On the day we ventured to Grafton Street, March 19th, it was quite a cold, however, the su</span><span style="font-size: 14px">n was shining and visitors seemed to be enjoying their afternoon. It should be noted that March 19th is a bank holiday in Ireland, meaning that many people have the day off of work. To our surprise, we did not observe very many people on their phones, or in their “phone space” as Wilken and Goggin (2017) discuss (p. 60). Almost everyone, with the exception of a few phone users, were present in their “local space,” not witnessing the street through their phon</span><span style="font-size: 14px">es but actually being present in the place. After a few minutes of walking around, it dawned on us that we were actually lost in our “phone space” as we attempted to document the environment around us. The people who we did notice were on their phone seemed to be shifting their attention back and forth from exciting activities taking place on the street to whatever they were doing on their phone. Wilken and Goggin describe this phenomenon, “for technologically equipped pedestrians, for instance, attention is always a fluctuating state, where pedestrians tend to switch their attention from one activity to another, each time at the expense of the last and as a result of competing stimuli.” Passerby’s on their mobile phones were in their “phone space” one second and in the blink of an eye, their gaze was back to their “local space” when a busker began performing. This clearly exemplified Wilken and Goggin’s idea that place, with the domestication of mobile phones, is an “experience of distraction and disjointedness” (p. 60). By keenly observing pedestrians on Grafton Street, we were able to witness just how intensely the definition of ‘place’ has changed with the invention and domestication of mobile phones.</span></p>

<p>Domestication is a concept that is used in many fields like sociology of technology, media and communication studies. It deals with how technology is accepted, used or rejected by people and covers analyses and descriptions of processes that govern these choices. By using a theory such as this one, we can look at the various ways in which we incorporate our smartphones into our everyday lives. Maddie, a great friend, and fellow iPhone user, doesn&#8217;t use her phone all day every day but checks it frequently. In the morning the first thing she does is turn off her alarm (which is an application of the iPhone) because that&#8217;s what wakes her up. Then, she will usually check to see if she has any messages or calls that came while she was sleeping. Next, she will usually check all of her social media. This includes Instagram, Twitter, and Snapchat. She said that if she slept through her alarm and was late for whatever she had that morning that she would still check her phone quickly but maybe not respond to them until she wasn&#8217;t in a rush for time. So, even though she still makes time for her phone in a sticky situation, she doesn&#8217;t let it take total priority over her life. However, she said that she would respond in that situation if it were urgent. She said if she doesn&#8217;t have a busy day ahead of her that she will use it for around an hour in the morning. Also, Maddie checks it a lot at night before going to bed. &#8220;It really just depends on what kind of day I&#8217;m having.&#8221; So, depending on how busy she is will determine her amount of phone usage for that given day. She then went on to say that the phone activity she has during her day pertains more towards things that actually involve her day. However, at night she takes that time to catch up with old friends or possibly even call her parents.</p>
<p>When looking at her individual dimensions, Maddie says that she checks her phone at least 100 times a day. This doesn&#8217;t mean that she is actually using her phone but just that she is checking to see if she has any notifications. &#8220;Even if I&#8217;m not expecting a message, I&#8217;ll still check it.&#8221; So, at times, she, like many other iPhone users, get caught looking for ghost notifications. This is when you don&#8217;t actually hear or feel your phone get a notification, but our curiosity drives us towards checking anyway, just in case we may have one. Her main apps include Messaging, Email, Twitter, Snapchat, Facebook, and YouTube. Maddie, like me, is a huge user of YouTube and knows just exactly how much time it can take up. She then went on to say that Messaging is her top application but has gotten more use to using Snapchat ever since she has been abroad. This could be because she is either documenting the various places she goes to or even just sending a quick and easy update to a friend. As for importance, these apps are meaningful towards her because they create the opportunity for mass communication with anyone and everyone. So basically, they just keep her connected with everyone that is special to her no matter where they are. I then went on to ask who her top three people that she communicates with. &#8220;Honestly, my mom, dad, and Jess.&#8221; When traveling, whether it be around other countries or even just Ireland, she finds that both Mytaxi and her maps are a crucial part of her day. Even if she has been to a place already, she still finds herself just making sure that she&#8217;s on the right path. Her iPhone story had to do with our trip to Brussels. We were going from Brussels to Brugge, and we were trying to figure out how to walk to the train station. Using maps, she was able to avoid street work, unnecessary paths, and even get us turn by turn directions to find the exact entrance of the train station. &#8220;At that moment, trying to find your way around an unfamiliar place can almost be impossible, but with the help of my iPhone it made it so much easier.&#8221; In this story, it is evident that through domestication theory one can see how impactful Maddie&#8217;s smartphone has been in her life.</p>
<p>When looking at Malleability, Maddie found that she arranged her smartphone towards the necessities of her current everyday life. She has her music, messages, phone, and internet on the bottom of her screen. This is where people&#8217;s primary applications can be found. As for her home page, she has Instagram, Twitter, Youtube, Facebook, Snapchat, Spotify, Whatsapp, MyTaxi, Dublin Bus App. &#8220;Both my four lower applications and my home page tend to change with the times. Apps like the Dublin bus and MyTaxi would never have been on my home page back in America because we use Uber there or just drive. But now that were in Ireland these apps tend to take priority in my life because they do so much for me&#8221;. She then went on to say that, even though there are a lot of apps on her second page that she uses just as much on her home page, she doesn&#8217;t enjoy grouping the apps together (constructing a category of apps so that way you can fit more apps in a given spot while taking up less room). She said that this was because the apps in her home are there for quick and easy access. Being able to just unlock her phone and just hit the app she was looking for is how she prefers her set up. The extra step of having to go into the category and then find the app she wants is just not the set-up she is looking for in her home page. As for her notifications, she does set individual ringtones to certain contacts. However, these contacts only include people that are very important to her. So, people like her mom and dad may have their own ringtones but someone she just met most likely won&#8217;t. She does this so that way when she hears that exact ring she will know who it is without even having to check her phone.</p>
<p>As for Maddie&#8217;s social connections, she said that her mobile phone is extremely crucial no matter who she is connecting with. Whether it be her friends here or her family and friends back home, her mobile phone is a vital tool towards inhibiting that universal connection to others. Her geographic location will determine who she is in contact the most. So being in Ireland, she tends to contact her friends that are here more than her friends that are at home. Even though all her friends maintain the same level of importance, there is just more relevance towards her friends here when looking at her day to day life.</p>
<p>Ultimately, through domestication theory, it can be said that Maddie&#8217;s phone is an extension of who she is. It makes reduces her life of stress and is a tool that allows her to make and keep connections with all those whom she cares about.</p>

<p>After interviewing Shaun about his mobile media habits, I learned quite a bit about why and how he uses his phone. Domestication Theory describes how technology is integrated into a user’s everyday life (Sullivan, 2018). Through a domestication analysis of Shaun’s mobile use, I was able to gain deeper insight as to how technology has become an integral part of his daily life and what the functions of his cell phone mean to him. Shaun admitted that he uses his cell phone constantly, every day. He said, “I use it in my bed, I use it when I go out, I check my email with it, I use it literally for everything.” I then asked him what time of day he uses his phone most and what does he do on it during these times. He told me that he uses his cell phone most as soon as he wakes up and also before he goes to bed, but not so much during the day. In the morning, as soon as he opens his eyes, he answers messages he received overnight, checks his email, checks his social media apps and finally, watches YouTube if he has extra time. He does similar tasks on his phone before going to sleep, but most of this screen time is taken up by watching YouTube videos and talking to his family as well as his girlfriend on FaceTime. Shaun explained that since arriving in Dublin, he must FaceTime his girlfriend late at night due to the time difference between Ireland and the U.S and due to both of their busy schedules as well. He describes how this has been difficult for the couple since they have never had to work around a time difference when scheduling FaceTime dates before. This is a great example of how Shaun has had to adapt his technology use to his new living situation. Bertel explains that in the domestication process, “smartphones travel with users across the situations of everyday life and are not tied to specific and bounded contexts…” (Bertel, 2017, p. 85). Just from the first few minutes of my interview with Shaun, it was evident how much his cell phone practices have become a part of his everyday life and that he has been forced to adapt to these practices to a new situation, his move to Dublin.</p>
<p>Shaun engages with iMessage, What’s App, Facetime, Instagram, Twitter, Safari, YouTube, and maps, and the Dublin Bus app every day, multiple times a day. He said that using messaging apps and using Facetime are most important to him because they allow him to communicate with his friends and family back home. He also went on to explain that the map app has been also extremely crucial to traveling not only in Dublin but also to other countries in Europe. To get around Dublin, Shaun takes advantage of the Dublin Bus App when he is on-the-go. He said, “the Dublin Bus App is also really important to me because I can use it to see what bus to take, especially when I’m running late to something, which happens quite often.” Bertel writes about the concept of ‘flexible alignment.’ (p. 87). She says that flexible alignment “captures the fact that users routinely consult online information systems just-in-time (e.g. maps, weather apps and bus schedules), which provides them an increased flexibility in their individual management of everyday life” (p. 87). Shaun’s use of the Dublin Bus app exemplifies flexible alignment as he is able to get bus information in order to get around the city every day. Shaun went on to tell me about a time he lost his phone while on a modeling job in New York City. He said that as soon as he realized it wasn’t in his backpack, he sprinted to everywhere they had been taking photographs that day to look for it. “I was freaking out because if I couldn’t find my phone, I would lose all my contacts, photos, and more importantly, I would not be able to navigate my way back home” Shaun stated. Without the increased flexibly of the maps app, Shaun would have a harder time getting back to Long Island; he would have had to ask strangers for directions and look for street signs, but luckily for Shaun, he found his phone in a friend’s backpack.</p>
<p>Phones allow for customization, and according to Bertel (2017), they are malleable. “Smartphones are malleable devices in so far that the content and services to which they provide access may to a high degree be selected and configured by the individual user” (p. 89).  I asked Shaun a little bit about how he organizes his apps to appear on the mail screen. He expressed that he has his most used apps, like iMessage, What’s App, Facetime, Instagram, Twitter, Safari, YouTube, maps, and the Dublin Bus app set up appear on his mail screen simply for convenience purposes. The accessibility of placing one’s most utilized apps on their mail screen has become domesticated. After this discussion, I asked Shaun if he had customized his background photo or ringtones. He said that he had changed the iPhone&#8217;s default photo to a picture of him and his girlfriend when they first got together and that he hadn’t changed any ringtones. Shaun’s change in background photos displays the malleability of smartphones in Domestication Theory, that users adapt their technological devices to fit a life change.</p>
<p>In the last few minutes of my interview with Shaun, we began to discuss how important his mobile phone was to his social connection with others. He explained that he thought it was basically the only way to connect socially with others, especially connecting with friends back home in the U.S. He stated, “at this point, my phone is literally everything, if I didn’t have a phone, I don’t know what I would do.” This statement alone highlights the fact that technology has become an intrinsic part of socialization in Shaun’s daily life. He then talked about how it would be so much more difficult to stay in a committed relationship without the communicative function of his mobile phone. He said he probably contacts his girlfriend and his parents the most via mobile media. Shaun’s mobile phone has become domesticated in many ways throughout his daily life.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Ha&#8217;Penny Bridge:</p>
<p><iframe width="654" height="491" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/59wqZ8Dr-uE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The main purpose of a bridge is for someone to get from Point A to Point B over a small body of water.  In Ireland’s capital city of Dublin, the River Liffey runs through the city, dividing the North side from the South side.  Therefore, many bridges have been built over the years to transport Dubliners from one side to the other. The historic Ha’Penny Bridge located in downtown Dublin has been getting Dubliners and other visitors over the river since 1816.  Originally named The Wellington Bridge, after the Duke of Wellington, when it opened in 1816, it is officially named The Liffey Bridge. However, despite these two names, it is best known as The Ha’Penny Bridge. The pedestrian bridge gained this name from the half penny toll that was required to cross the bridge for the first 100 years of its existence.  There was even a time in the early 1900s when the toll was increased to a “penny-ha’penny”, requiring Dubliners to pay a cent and a half to cross the river. Today, it is free to cross the bridge. For some, crossing this bridge is part of their daily commute, while for others it is one of Dublin’s many historic sites where tourists come to take photos and eventually make their way into the famous Temple Bar area when they cross to the South side of the River Liffey.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While on the bridge, we observed many people making their way across in both directions, minding their own business as if it was their everyday routine.  Meanwhile, others stopped for photos of the bridge and of themselves on the bridge. Furthermore, we were two of the people on the bridge for the purposes of taking photos and videos of it, rather than just simply crossing it.  The use of mobile media was seen by ourselves, as well as by other tourists using their smartphones to document their experience on the bridge. Additionally, the people simply making their way across the bridge were seen using mobile media whether they were talking or texting on their phone while walking, or using it with headphones to listen to music.  One woman in particular that can be seen in our video spends a lot of time taking photos of herself and of the bridge using her smartphone. It was obvious that her intention for being there was not to just cross the bridge, but rather to document her experience at a historic Dublin site. Another example seen in our video is of two people visiting the bridge, where the one person is taking photos of the other person standing on the bridge.  Similar to the woman by herself taking photos, two people can be seen on the bridge for the purpose of documenting their experience in this location. Thinking about this through the black box theory, we do not know if these tourists are aware of the history behind the bridge, therefore “black boxing” the concept that it cost a half penny to cross the bridge. It is likely that most tourists do not consider this during their time on the bridge as they are caught up in documenting themselves in a picturesque Dublin scenery, using their smartphones to do so, also “black boxing” these objects.  Along with these tourists, we also not aware of the history behind Ha’Penny Bridge; it was not until filming and doing research that we realized the significance behind the name of this historic tourist attraction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While the bridge is just physical place in the geographic location of Dublin, it also represents a larger network of humans interacting with mobile media.  Whether people use their mobile devices to navigate themselves over the bridge, document photos and videos, or simply talk with others they may be meeting on the other side of the river, mobile media has a presence in this historic Dublin site.</span></p>

<p>Ayanna&#8217;s Interview:</p>
<p>The theory of domestication helps us gain an understanding of how technologies become integrated into people’s everyday lives and as a result, how they shape and alter people’s everyday behaviors.  The theory focuses on the role technologies play in people’s daily lives (Bartel, 2017, p.83).  One form of modern technology that has become heavily integrated into people’s everyday lives is the smartphone.  Through domestication theory, it can be studied how people’s smartphones have shaped their daily lives and behaviors.  One way to observe this is through interviewing a smartphone user to gain a better understanding of where, why, when, and how they use their smartphones on a daily basis.  In an interview with my partner, Ayanna Costley, she discusses the way in which she utilizes her smartphone.</p>
<p><strong>Situations of everyday life:</strong>  In the first part of the interview, Ayanna answered some general questions about her smartphone usage.  She claimed that she basically uses her smartphone all day, everyday.  In the morning it is the first thing she interacts with because it acts as her alarm clock.  After turning off her alarm clock, she checks social media such as Twitter and Snapchat, and also replies to any messages she received while she was sleeping.  Then, she proceeds to use it throughout the day for various uses that she discusses deeper, later in the interview.  Ayanna mentions that she checks her phone frequently throughout the day to check to see if she received any notifications.  When she downloaded the application “Moment” for our class assignment, the application told her that she checked her phone about 60 times a day.  Before she goes to bed at night is when she uses her phone the most.  She checks all her social media and sends messages to friends and family before going to bed.</p>
<p>In this first part of the interview, it is revealed how her smartphone shapes behaviors in her everyday life.  From the moment she wakes up in the morning, her smartphone is central to what she does for the rest of the day.  It can be seen through domestication theory how big of a role a smartphone plays in Ayanna’s daily routine.  She starts and ends her day by using it, and checks it and uses it for various uses throughout the day.</p>
<p><strong>Individual dimensions:  </strong>In the second part of the interview, Ayanna goes more in depth about her smartphone usage as she discusses specific applications she uses most frequently and specific scenarios she has used her phone in.  She states that she uses her Messages/Facebook Messenger application, Music, and Twitter the most on her smartphone.  These applications are the most important to her because Messages/Facebook Messenger allows her to stay connected to friends and family, which has been especially important since being here in Ireland.  She uses Music frequently in her down time, especially here in Ireland when she is spending time in her common room.  Twitter allows her to stay connected to friends and also allows her to build a network in the film industry where she hopes to have a career one day.  When I asked Ayanna about a memorable story involving her smartphone, she told me about a time in boarding school where she got hurt and had to go to the hospital.  She was using her phone to call her parents about 20 times because she couldn’t get through to them for some reason.  In the end she called her uncle who then was able to contact her parents to let them know she was okay.</p>
<p>This part of the interview with Ayanna revealed more details about her smartphone usage and how specifically it gets integrated into her life.  It can be seen how the applications she uses most frequently shapes her everyday behavior, simply by shaping how she communicates and connects with others through the applications available on the smartphone.  Her smartphone also provides ways in which to fill her downtime, such as playing music.  In the story she told about getting hurt at boarding school, her phone played a major role in the entire situation because her phone was the way in which she would let her parents know she was alright, which was a very important aspect of the situation as a whole.</p>
<p><strong>Malleability:  </strong>In part three of the interview, Ayanna discusses the organization and appearance of her smartphone.  She talks about how she organizes her applications on her screen by putting the ones she uses most on her first screen, and arranging them all by color in rainbow order from top to bottom so that she can find what she’s looking for quickly and easily.  On the bottom of the screen, the four applications that are always there no matter which screen page she’s on is her Messages, Phone, Safari, and Music, so that she always has access to them.  As far as the appearance of her phone, she typically has a wallpaper that is a photo of her and her friends, and she has a clear case because she likes the unique red color of her iPhone.</p>
<p>In this part of the interview, it can be seen how her smartphone is a reflection of her personality and the way in which she likes to arrange things in her life.  It is part of her identity because it showcases personal things such as photos of her and her friends, as well as the applications she uses daily and the unique way in which she organizes them.</p>
<p><strong>Social connections:  </strong>In the final part of the interview, Ayanna discusses the important role her smartphone plays in connecting her with others.  As she mentioned earlier in the interview, some of her most used applications are the ones that allows her to connect with others.  These applications keep her connected to family and friends no matter where she is or what she is doing, which has always been very important to her but has become even more important since being in Ireland.  She connects with immediate family members and close friends most frequently through her smartphone, whether it’s through Messages/Facebook Messenger, which is what she uses most commonly, FaceTime, or normal phone calls.</p>
<p>The final part of the interview reveals that for Ayanna, the communication tools offered by her smartphone is what is most important to her when it comes to her smartphone, which interestingly enough is what a phone was originally intended to do, however, today’s phones allow us to communicate in various ways plus do many other things with the phone as well.  Through domestication theory it can be seen how heavily Ayanna’s phone is integrated into her life and how it plays a central role in her day to day activities.  Her smartphone shapes her communication behaviors, as well as many other behaviors such as filling her downtime and creating networks for future careers all through one single device – her iPhone.</p>

<p>Nicole&#8217;s Interview:</p>
<p>As a theoretical framework, domestication theory functions as a tool to help us understand how media technologies, such as the mobile phone, are implemented into our daily lives. Domestication theory is user-centered: I<span style="font-size: 14px">t focuses on how individuals or groups of people, children as opposed to adults for example, engage with different types of mobile technologies through a consideration of the specific uses/appropriation. The following is a study/analysis of mobile technologies, mainly the smart phone, in Nicole’s life using domestication theory. When she first wakes up in the morning, Nicole’s phone functions as an alarm clock—in other words, waking her up as it wakes itself up. While she does u</span><span style="font-size: 14px">se her smartphone throughout the entirety of her day, she typically uses her phone more during the evening time. After some thought she attributed this realization to the fact that it is easier and more convenient to talk</span><span style="font-size: 14px">to friends/family back in the States because it’ll usually be their afternoon time. She also mentioned that she tends to use her phone most at night because this is a time where she can catch up on all of the notifications and general things she missed, especially if she did not use her phone too much that day. This accounts for a lot of her screen time each day. The specific functions/apps she uses daily on her smartphone are: alarm clock, music app, maps, Snapchat, Instagram, and iMessages. As mentioned before, the alarm clock is vital because it wakes her up/keeps her on schedule. Music allows her to browse new releases and listen to her favorite songs while getting ready, on the bus, etc. Apps like Snapchat, Instagram and iMessage enable Nicole to connect to friends, family and pop culture as a whole. She can share pictures/videos from her daily experiences here in Dublin with those back at home and also engage with other’s digital lives from these apps. A few weeks ago she was on the bus coming bac</span><span style="font-size: 14px">k to DCU, her phone dried its battery and died. Because she</span><span style="font-size: 14px">was already on the bus and knew which stop to get off of, she did not necessarily need her phone for Maps. However she was always used to having her phone on to entertain her or keep her busy while on a bus ride. So, on this bus ride while her phone was dead she observed that other riders were on their phone and that his was a normal thing to do. She probably would not have noticed this if she was also on her phone. Nicole described the arrangement of apps of her phone in terms of most used functions. At the bottom of her screen she usually has the iMessage app, phone app and mail app for easy access to being able to connect and respond with others. In terms of phone custo</span><span style="font-size: 14px">mization, she has a plain black phone case and usually uses a photo of her and her friends as her background screensaver. For security purposes, she uses both a passcode and fingerprint to unlock her phone. Nicole’s mobile smartphone is extremely important to he social connections with others. Without it, she would find it hard and next to impossible to</span><span style="font-size: 14px">seamlessly and wackily connect and engage with friends/family back at home. Her phone is not only plays a significant role in connecting to others but also to connecting to place and the world around her. Because we are living in a brand new place and traveling to different places around Europe, Nicole would find it hard to safely “connect” to new places without her phone. Without it she would not be able to call/text someone in case of an emergency or even us</span><span style="font-size: 14px">e the Maps app to locate her and offer directions. Right now, she contacts friends and family most via mobile media because she is so far away from them. She uses a combination of mobile media technologie</span><span style="font-size: 14px">s to contact them, including iMessage and FaceTime, in addition to social media like Instagram and Snapchat. Nicole is a great study for how domestication of mobile media can take place. Her examples prove that technology can and will be integrated into everyday life. This can change and adapt, for example, as Nicole primarily uses her phone at night time to communicate with people in a different time</span><span style="font-size: 14px">zone. If she were home in the States, this might not necessarily be true. Nicole’s use of her smartphone also tak</span><span style="font-size: 14px">es into account situational contexts. The placement of her phone (usually next to her/ always within reach), the time she uses it and how/where she uses it are all important to understand the appropriation, objecti</span><span style="font-size: 14px">fication, incorporation and co</span><span style="font-size: 14px">nversion of d</span><span style="font-size: 14px">omestication (</span><span style="font-size: 14px">becoming part of everyday social connections/interactions.  </span><span style="font-size: 14px">   </span><img class=" wp-image-134 aligncenter" style="font-size: 1.4rem;font-style: inherit;font-weight: inherit" src="http://mobilemedia.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2018/03/unnamed-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="239" height="319" srcset="http://mobilemedia.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2018/03/unnamed-225x300.jpg 225w, http://mobilemedia.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2018/03/unnamed-768x1024.jpg 768w, http://mobilemedia.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2018/03/unnamed-1x1.jpg 1w" sizes="(max-width: 239px) 100vw, 239px" /></p>

<p>Place: The National Museum of Ireland</p>
<p>Date: March 10, 2018</p>
<p>Our Observation:</p>
<p>The National Museum of Ireland, consisting of over 10,000 exhibits, is an historical structure dating back to the year 1857. Its doors have been open to locals and tourists alike, sharing its amazing collection of the species in the natural world, dedicated one whole section to animals found in and around Ireland itself. The museum, also referred to as the “Dead Zoo”, welcomes many visitors and tourists within Dublin, impressing them with over 2 million species inside. The Geographic location of the Museum serves to be beneficial because of the accessibility of the building to many visitors. It’s location on Merrion Street Upper allows for people to visit multiple tourist attractions like the The National Gallery of Ireland and even Trinity College, attractions that are in walking distance of the Zoo.<br />
For our project, Jess and I decided to visit the Dead Zoo not only because of the attractions but because of the opportunity to observe. We visited the museum on March 10th around 2pm. Without realizing it initially, Saturday was a good day to travel to the Zoo because of the amount of people out and about on weekend excursions. Many different groups of people, of all ages, walk around and learn about the species on their own time, reading the labels next to the exhibits and taking pictures to remember the experience. Immediately after walking in, the tall skeletons of the many moose species of Ireland can be seen, towering over everyone who walks by them. Because of this, everyone, including the adults resemble young children looking up in awe of the massive structures in front of them. The Zoo has a strict policy of no flash photography or videography, something that we were unaware of initially, which discouraged people from being on their phones. Because of this, people were walking through the exhibit encouraging family member and friends to look at the animals and trying to be respectful of others who were observing the species as well. There is a image of a father and son, within our short video montage of our visit, showing an example of shared experiences, one that didn’t require technological devices. The interactions among friends and family in the place were interesting to observe, going along with the dea that “traditionally, place is an interweaving of communication and action” (Wilken &amp; Goggin 2016, p 51). The communication took place as the man educated his son of the species, and family members caught each other’s attention as they wanted to show one another the different exhibits. These were all accompanied by actions such as gazing in awe, walking around the museum, and reading about the animals of Ireland.<br />
Jess and I, on the other hand, became very aware of our surroundings when a man in a museum uniform was watching us with confusion as we used our handheld mobile stabilizer to capture our surroundings. After quickly figuring out that videography was prohibited, we ended out excursion. This is an example of our phenomenological approach. We often saw Wilken &amp; Goggin’s idea of pedestrian’s switching their gaze from the animals, to our smartphones in a place where people typically take photos of the animals, not other people in the space (Wilken &amp; Goggin 60). The pedestrians switched their gaze often as the stimulus of the animals, other people, and changing surroundings overtook their attention. Although the second room in the museum, holding species around the world, was closed to the public on this day, we were able to take note of the many interactions taking place in the initial room of the museum.<br />
Using a phenomenological lens to analyze our environment, we noticed that the overall sense of the place was calm and welcoming. The lights were dimmed creating a very solemn space, which was respectable considering all of the species in the museum are either stuffed or frozen. There were many children eagerly looking at the exhibits and talking loudly, conversing about the animals. Many wanted to touch the exhibits, although the parents were happy to find that the children and the animals were seperated by glass through most of the building. We took into account our presence in the space as we captured our experience as visitors to the museum as well. Overall, it was very interesting to observe the people and our surroundings in the space.</p>

<p>Jaimie&#8217;s Interview:</p>
<p>In my interview with Jaimie, I learned a lot about her smartphone usage. I found that she typically uses her smartphone throughout the day, but for different purposes. These purposes align with domestication theory and the integration of the smartphone into our society. She starts by using her phone as an alarm clock and quickly checks her social media accounts such as Instagram and Snapchat to check her notifications and explore what her friends back at Muhlenberg at doing. These social media apps provide a visual and audio portrayal of what is happening back home. Immediately, this relates to domestication theory. She does not have a physical alarm clock that wakes her up in the morning. Instead, she relies on her cellular device to wake her up in time for classes and other activities. Instead of collecting her thoughts and having a quiet moment to herself, she chooses to check her social media notifications. As Turkle 2008 says, “Adults use tethering technologies during what most of us think of as down time, the time we might have daydreamed during a cab ride, waiting in line, or walking to work” (Turkle 129). While laying in bed, Jaimie could take a quiet moment to herself since she is “not the type of person to jump right out of bed in the morning,” but instead, checks her social media accounts to instantly feel connected to others that are not in her physical space. According to Turkle, this is the behavior of the average young adult in modern times.</p>
<p>Jaimie says that she notices herself using her smartphone for different purposes in Dublin than at home. When she is at Muhlenberg, she notices herself using her phone to constantly check emails and texts, but doesn’t notice herself doing that as much while abroad. She also uses her phone more at the end of the day in Dublin since the time difference allows her to check in with family and friends back home in the later hours. Her usage also varies based on what her activities are for the day. She says that she uses her phone more when she is not busy, and she used it more when she was stuck inside due to the snowstorm we had in Dublin. Here, she is using her phone for entertainment purposes. She notices herself picking up her phone to check it about every 15 minutes when she is not busy. This also goes along with Turkle’s idea of the “tethered-self.” She is constantly tethered to her smartphone and feels the need to check it often for notifications of someone trying to get in contact with her.</p>
<p>Her most used applications on her smartphone are messages, Snapchat, Instagram, Facebook, GroupMe, Spotify, email, and Shazam. These applications all serve different purposes for Jaimie and she tends to use different apps for different audiences. For example, while abroad, she uses messages to text her friends who also have Irish numbers, but GroupMe to communicate with those at home. She uses Instagram and Facebook to share photos and stay up to date with other’s social lives. She also uses Snapchat as a form of quick communication with friends and to send funny pictures of real-time events. She said that music is very important because it “puts me in a good mood transitioning classes or sitting in a room. Discovering music makes me feel good.” Before the smartphone, Jaimie would have had to mail letters home, or find a public telephone to communicate with others not in her physical space. She also would not have easy access to music, and would have to bring a physical camera to Ireland to share photos with those at home. Now, she can use her smartphone daily to have access to all of these features, and she chooses to utilize these features all on one device, hence domestication theory. As Wikipedia 2018 states, “First, technologies are integrated into everyday life and adapted to daily practices. Secondly, the user and its environment change and adapt accordingly. Thirdly, these adaptations feedback into innovation processes in industry, shaping the next generation of technologies and services.” Jaimie has integrated these communication apps into her everyday life for quick communication back to the States, and relies on them to complete daily tasks and stay in touch with others. She shared a story of when she accidentally dropped her phone into a toilet, and tried everything she could to bring it “back to life,” but unfortunately, she was unable to do so. She said that she almost “had a meltdown,” which shows how much she values her smartphone’s features. She was most devastated about the photos she lost that she did not have backed up onto her computer. This is typical behavior of the modern young adult, according to Turkle.</p>
<p>The way Jaimie has chosen to organize her smartphone is interesting, and shows her prioritized applications. Her main four apps on the bottom of her phone are music, phone, messages, and email. These four are easy to access and available on any screen. From there, she has categorized the apps on her home screen into social media, navigation, and utilities. Shazam is also on this home screen, but not in any category since music is very important to her, and needs to be quickly accessible when attempting to identify a song that is playing in public. There are also random apps on her second screen, which do not fit into the other three categories, and she does not use these as often. Her lock screen shows her friends from the States, which she says is a visual reminder to stay in touch with them. The beach is her homepage, which is a relaxing picture, reminding her of the good times she had at the beach. She does have a password to unlock her iPhone, for security reasons. She figures that there is a lot of personal information that is held on her phone, and if someone were to have access to her phone, they would have a harder time gaining access to her personal information if there is a password protecting this. She has a plain black case to protect her smartphone in case she drops it, and this case has a section to hold her student ID. This also applies to domestication theory. Since she almost always has her phone on her, and there is no application on her smartphone to replace her student ID, she can at least have her ID attached to her smartphone at all times. She does not have stickers or other decorations on the case of her phone, and she did not purchase a ringtone. She feels that these actions are a bit outdated, which shows how the smartphone has developed over the years. In the past, it was trendy to have a pop music song as your ringtone, but that trend is beginning to fade out as the third phase of domestication theory, innovation and changes, sets in.</p>
<p>Jaimie feels that her phone is very important to her in terms of connecting with others because she feels that she often forgets to do so when she is distracted with schoolwork and other activities. She mostly keeps in contact with friends and family, but enjoys knowing that she is able to connect with anyone who is also connected online right through her mobile device. Jaimie’s usage of her smartphone aligns with Turkle’s description of “tethered teens,” but Jaimie does find times and places to put her phone down and enjoy her surroundings. She says that since she has been abroad, she has noticed herself checking her mobile phone less since she has been very busy with seeing the beautiful views of Ireland.</p>

<p>Jessika’s Interview:</p>
<p>Jessika Parra uses mobile media throughout her day in order to make her life easier, connect with family and friends and keep up-to-date on what’s going on in the world. Domestication theory states that technologies are welcomed into our daily routines which forces us to adapt to using it. Jess finds herself dependent on her smartphone because of the many amenities and tools it possess. I found that when listening to Jess explain how she uses her device; it was important to note the differences between her phone use abroad versus when back in the states. Keeping in mind the everyday tasks done by mobile devices, the individualistic qualities expressed with it and the connections it allows people to make, domestication theory plays a key role in helping us understand how and why people appropriate this technology into their daily lives.</p>
<p>Jess’s mobile phone became an essential tool once she traveled to Ireland. With new scenery, people and transportation systems, GoogleMaps, and Apple Maps play an important role in getting her where she needs to be. Before GPS and Google/Apple Maps, people would use physical maps and simply ask for directions. Jess emphasized how she noticed a significant increase in her usage of navigation apps, making her state that she “couldn’t imagine life without them”. In this sense, these applications stand for more than just a tool but a means of safety and provide a feeling of comfort when accessible. This sense of security has been researched by may media scholars, questioning the independence of teens and young adults, as they go out into the world, always knowing that a quick ‘check-in’ is available via the internet or by phoning a friend.</p>
<p>Besides navigation, users find themselves hooked on the idea of being accessible at all times. Within her article, <em>The Tethered Self</em>, author Sherry Turkle suggests that “the cell…is always available and there is a high probability that one will be able to reach a source of validation through it. It is understood that the validating cell conversation may be brief, just a ‘‘check-in,’’ but more is not necessarily desired” (2008 p.128). Jess experiences this feeling of validation when friends back at Muhlenberg, family members in Bethlehem Pa, and loved ones reach out just to catch up and see how she’s doing. For short and concise connections, she uses applications like Snapchat and WhatsApp, to keep those strong connections back home without disturbing her daily routine abroad. This technology became a part of her routine because of the accessibility to applications that keep the connections. Jess is very close with her family, so much so, that they are constantly reaching out to her making sure she’s “still alive”. This is where quick interactions come in handy once again. The quick “just thinking about you” text message gets a greater meaning put into it when communicating with people far away. From a phenomenological perspective, Jess notices herself not feeling as content or happy when she hasn’t reached out to people back home. She sees their facetiming rituals, snapchat streaks and picture sharing as representative of a way of staying relevant and present even when abroad.</p>
<p>When asked about how Jess likes to decorate and organize her mobile device, she went into great detail about the choices she made when setting it up. She decided to keep the original applications on the home screen that were put there automatically. She has to color code them so that no two applications of the same color are next to one another, for aesthetic purposes. She has a marble-looking case on it and a card holder that says, “Good Vibes Only”. She likes this because it makes her feel happy when she looks at it. This sense of control is something that Jess likes, especially since there are many aspects about her device that she can’t control, like the notifications that come in on the regular. Within their article, <em>Adolescents and Smartphone</em>s, Maialen Garmendia, Miguel Casado del Río and Estefanía Jimenez, these authors note people’s tendencies to prioritize their messaging so that they don’t feel as manipulated by their own device. They claim that “as an alternative to putting the smartphone completely aside, some adolescents say they are able to keep the device on and next to them in order to read those messages regarded as relevant, while not paying attention to the rest” (2018 p.115). Jess claimed to do this in her own life. She purposely puts her phone on her desk before she goes to bed because she knows that the only notification she wants to hear is her alarm waking her up in the morning. She is consciously making the choice to ignore all temptations or urges to reach for her phone until she has to, when she has to get up. Showing this sense of control is important and should be practiced more, allowing individuals to feel more independent and capable even when their mobile devices aren’t glued to their side.</p>
<p>The domestication of mobile phones can be applied to the way that we chose to personalize it. This device no longer does its service and is tossed away, but is decorated, kept close at all times and treated with ‘care”. Besides the physical changes to the appearance of the phone, we get to customize the data presented inside of it. When talking about how Jess organizes her own device, she mentioned that she places her applications in a very strategic way to enhance functionality and to continue her overall aesthetic. She, unlike most people, has kept the applications that are naturally set on the first screen where they were, such as the clock, email app, camera, photos, notes, wallet and health. Although she does not use all of these, she keeps them there because of their look. She claims that she could never have “two blue-colored applications next to one another, that’s just not okay”. Jess added applications to her smart phone which can be supported by the ‘incorporation’ part of domestication theory. She made functions like paying others online through Venmo more of a necessity in her everyday life using the mobile phone.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mobile Media in the Garden of Remembrance </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On March 6th around 3:00 pm, we visited Parnell Square, Rotunda, Dublin 1 Ireland, also known as the Garden of Remembrance. Because this is a serene garden, we expected to observe people lounging around enjoying the view. Instead, we were met with a swarm of tourists taking photos rather than taking in the beauty of the space. As shown in the video, not one person was without their phone or camera. We decided to interview a couple using a selfie stick along with a woman using her phone w</span><span style="font-size: 14px;">hile the little girl she was watching played beside her. Evidently, it was important for those in the space to document their time there because of its aesthetic and historical significance. Would their experience differ, though, if they put down their mobile phones?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One thing we both noticed was an interaction between a mother and her son. The mother was just wandering around on her phone texting, not taking pictures or paying attention to the space, while her son was walking around getting photos on his phone with various angles. After a few minutes, she called out to him and said, “Okay, did you get your pictures? Can we leave now?” This trend was seen throughout the garden; most came briefly to document their time there before leaving. I</span><span style="font-size: 14px;">t seemed as though people did not spend more than 10-15 minutes at the Garden of Remembrance. Although it is a serene and peaceful space with a lot of historical significance, it is becoming a spot for tourists to capture a few images then go on to their next plan for the day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All the individuals we interviewed happened to be tourists; one woman was from France and the other couple was from Spain. It is possible that Irish citizens would take in this space in a different way because they know what it looks like already; instead of going for pho</span><span style="font-size: 14px;">tos, they may sit at a bench and have a cup of coffee on their work break. We did notice a man sitting on a bench reading a book. He was there for a while; this is an instance where he still was not completely taking in the space he was in with his eyes, but at least he did not have a screen in front of him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If visitors had looked up from their media to take in the space around them, they would have seen a large, grand statue commemorating Irish soldiers falle</span><span style="font-size: 14px;">n in the Civil War, along with a cross shaped pond. Flower displays decorated the steps with bright green grass surrounding the entire garden. This should be a space where people honor and respect what it is supposed to represent, but because it has become such a significant tourist attraction, some of its purpose goes away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our experience was a unique one; we were also using our mobile phones in the area but for different reasons. Our mobile phones surely captured the physical space, but more significantly revealed the way the space was being used by those present there. We would have hoped to stay longer and really take in the scenery, but it felt a bit rushed because of how often tourists would quickly walk in and out of the garden. In the end, our experience was similar to that of the visiting tourist because we were also seeing the park through the lens of a phone. The mobile device acted as a sort of barrier between us and the place we had chosen. </span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Interview Analysis of Domestication Theory</p>
<p>            The domestication theory explains how mobile phones are actively integrated into our daily lives. Jess certainly fits this mold but it different ways than I expected when I first came into the interview. It was interesting interviewing her because she uses her mobile phone in more unique and practical ways than I do or others I know do. First off, Jess has a Samsung phone, which certainly differs from the iPhone. For example, she uses her personal camera more than the camera provided on her mobile phone because the quality is not as clear as she would like it to be. She also does not have a case on her phone because h<span style="font-size: 14px;">er Samsung is so large and protective that it will not get damaged without one. As Troels Fiboek Bertel writes in his article “Domesticating Smartphones,” domestication theory “emphasizes the active role of individuals and groups in shaping technologies as they are integrated into the contexts and practices of everyday life” (p. 83). Certainly it seems our Smartphones have been incorporated into almost every aspect of daily lives and may shape the way individuals go about their activities throughout the day. Jess, though, seems to use her phone less than a typical young adult would. For example, in the morning she uses her phone as an alarm clock but swipes away her notifications because they bother her. Instead, in the morning she uses an app called Quora, an educational app created for general questions and answers; individuals from around the world use this. I find it impressive that she does not feel the need to check her mes</span><span style="font-size: 14px;">sages in the morning and scroll through her social media pages. This educational app seems like a great way to start the day! Although she does not use social media as much, Jess still does use her phone a great amount to connect with her family and friends back at home.</span></p>
<p>When asked when she uses her phone the most, Jess explained that she uses it anytime she is “really bored,” like when she is on the bus or trying to sleep at night. In sum, she uses her phone most often around the hours of 11:00 pm and midnight. I said the same to her in my interview. It seems that many individuals, especially young adults, use their phones at night in order to relax and catch up on the social media posts they may have missed that day. It is important to use the mobile phone at night while abroad, though, in order to talk to family, friends and other loved ones at home due to the time difference. Jess tends to video chat via Facebook messenger at later hours in Dublin because this is when her family is available to talk back in America. She informed me that she never video chats when she is in the states because she is “home every 2-3 weeks” because she lives only about 50 minutes away from Muhlenberg and she lives with her closest friends when on campus in Allentown. As Bertel writes, “Smartphones travel with users a<span style="font-size: 14px;">cross the situations of everyday life and are not tied to specific and bounded contexts such as households, which have traditionally been a central focus in domestication research” (p. 85). Domestication theory may argue that the location of an individual may determine how they will use their phone in that space; each space also may be interpreted in different ways depending upon the person. It seems that the mobile phone may be used in diverse ways while travelling abroad than it would in the comforts of home. Jess and I both agreed that we do not use apps such as Whatsapp or Groupme as much while at home, but it becomes important abroad in order to connect with those on the program along with long distance calls to our families. This is where the instant gratification and verification theories come in, as well. Jess explained that her Snapchat use has gone up a significant amount since going abroad in order to show everybody what she is experiencing on a daily basis. As Sherry Turkle writes in “Always-On/Always-On-You: The Tethered Sel</span><span style="font-size: 14px;">f, “People are tethered to the gratifications offered by their online selves. These include the promise of affection, conversation, a sense of new beginnings” (p. 125). By showing people what is going on in her daily life and receiving positive feedback and responses from her photos, Jess feels gratified and content she shared them. Along with Snapchat use, sending and receiving text messages and Facebook messages allows her to feel like she is still with her family and connected to those at home when she occasionally may feel alone; this is how Jess responded when asked how important her mobile phone is for social connection with others.</span></p>
<p>Along with the importance of social connections, Jess also talked about the significance of the GPS/ maps provided on her Smartphone in order to know where she is going and get where she needs to be in a timely fashion. Bertel writes, “…the smartphone is being domesticated as a go-to medium for wayfinding” (p. 86). Instead of calling friends to ask for directions, one can just pull out their Smartphone and find their way back. Jess describes a situation where<span style="font-size: 14px;">maps completely saved her and her friends.</span></p>
<p>Jess was hiking with Muhlenberg Outdoors Club last year to see the Blood Moon on the Appalachian Mountains. It was completely dark outside, though, and they ended up turning the wrong way and found themselves no longer on a direct path. As they kept walking, they were able to gain some service on their phones and use Google maps to get them back to the trail they were supposed to be on. That took about 3 hours, but without the GPS, who knows how long it would have taken to get them to get back home! We rely so heavily on Google maps that most would not even think to take a physical map with them on a hike or trip because it is not such a necessity anymore. Along with the reliability of the maps app, Jess spoke about how the both the weather app and calendar app are on the front page of her phone for easy accessibility. Bertel writes, “users routinely consult online information systems just-in-time (e.g. maps, weather apps and bus schedules), which provides them an increased flexibility in their individual management of everyday life” (p. 87). I felt the most intriguing response from Jess was the fact that she checks her Weather app every morning in order to “know what to wear for the day.” The use of mobile phones have becom<span style="font-size: 14px;">e such a daily routine that some individuals do not even look out the window or walk outside to know what the weather is for the day.</span></p>
<p>Although Jess does not use her phone so much for social media when she is in the states, it does seem that she relies on it more often when she is travelling overseas. I still did find it interesting, though, that she puts her phone on “do not disturb” and swipes away her notifications; I am very quick to check notifications in the morning! Domestication theory describes how technology has become such an essential part of our lives; mobile phones are certainly an essential part of<span style="font-size: 14px;">many individuals’ daily lives. Jess seems to use her phone for some unique purposes and it was fascinating to hear her perspective on that and see just how important this theory is and how it can apply to any sort of daily Smartphone usage.</span></p>

<p>Interview Analysis of Domestication Theory</p>
<p>A great strength of Domestication Theory is that it takes a close look at how technology is used by <em>individuals </em>within a greater <em>context </em>(Haddon, 2018, p. 71). Domestication Theory is analyzed through case studies and interviews. To apply this theory, I’ve interviewed Rachel and analyzed her interactions with her mobile phone. Rachel has “tamed” her phone in a way to fit her individual needs and configure to her lifestyle. The very first thing she must do each day is wake up on time. To accomplish this, she uses the alarm clock on her phone, making sure to set it earlier than she actually has to wake up so she can snooze it a few times. Rachel knows herself and acknowledges that she cannot immediately wake up on the first blare of her alarm. She customized the alarm on her phone to fit her own specific need. This is just one example of how Rachel has “tamed” her phone. This falls in accordance with what Bertel says: “The metaphor ‘domestication’ connotes the taming of wild animals and suggests that media and technology, too, in a sense are tamed when users make them their own (2017, p. 83).”</p>
<p><strong>            </strong>After several snoozes, Rachel wakes up and immediately begins reviewing the notifications she had received while sleeping. She responds to messages in apps like GroupMe, Facebook Messenger, Snapchat, and texting. She is sure to like/respond to posts her friends may have tagged her in as well as scroll through social media to see what her friends are up to. The morning is one of the times she uses her phone the most. She also uses her phone more frequently past 10pm at night when she is alone and less distracted by the day’s events. However, in between that time, Rachel checks her phone every 15 minutes or so. It has become a sort of reflex for her, even if her phone has not alerted her of any new notifications.</p>
<p>Rachel uses Snapchat more than any other app, but also frequently checks Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook. It should be noted that these are all social media apps, implying that social connectivity is one of Rachel’s priorities. When I asked why she used Snapchat the most, Rachel said it was because she was abroad and liked sharing what she was doing with others. Snapchat’s features gratify this use easily: It can immediately send images to large amounts of people and can quickly apply useful geofilters, such as the name of a location or time.</p>
<p>An important distinction emerged as we were discussing Snapchat. This is her most used app while abroad, but she felt the answer would be different if she were at Muhlenberg. Bertel says a person often “adapts his media use practices to his changing surroundings, domesticating the various media he uses across contexts (2017, p. 85).” This is an important part of domestication theory; one’s uses for a mobile phone and the gratifications they seek can change over time depending on varying physical and social situations. Rachel is far away from her friends and family back at home, so she uses Snapchat to share her environment with them in the hopes to close some of the distance. Similarly, she contacts different social groups more or less abroad than at home. Here in Ireland, she mostly communicates with her family. This is in part to help combat the homesickness she feels abroad. At home, however, she mostly uses her mobile phone to communicate with friends in order to discuss when and where they are going to get together and hang out.</p>
<p>At one point in our conversation, I asked Rachel to discuss a memorable time with her mobile phone. She shared a time that she lost her phone and experienced panic. She said, “I freak out anytime I lose my phone because I feel like my whole life is on it.” When I asked her to expand on what she meant, she said she depends on her mobile phone to contact others. Without her phone, there’s no way to keep up with the world around her. This is a common theme throughout our conversation. It is clear that staying in touch with others is the primary gratification Rachel uses her phone for.</p>
<p>However, there are other apps Rachel needs as well. A few weeks ago, she was in Copenhagen all by herself, but trying to meet up with some friends. She was in a different country with a foreign language and had no idea how to reach her friends. Luckily, she was able to use Google Maps to find her way with ease. Bertel comments on this phenomena, saying “the smartphone is being domesticated as a go-to medium for wayfinding, partly because it is easy to look up such information on modern smartphones… clearly this can be described as domestication (2017, p. 86).”</p>
<p>Other uses Rachel has for her smartphone include the calculator app used for things like determining tip, the camera, the weather app used to help her pick out an appropriate outfit, venmo used to pay others virtually, and so much more. All of these apps plus her clock, maps, and social media discussed above demonstrate how mobile phones have become a “Swiss army knife” (Ling and Donner, 2013, p.13). It is many, many tools used for an abundance of gratifications all packed into a tiny box that can fit in our pockets. With so many options, it is easy to see why the use of smartphones is customized to tailor to individual needs, and how such a device is malleable, meaning its uses adapt to one’s changing surroundings and personal preferences.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><em>Section One: Place</em></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Place: Trinity College</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Observed on Wednesday, March 7th at 5:15PM by Stephanie Tabas, Sasha Cheer, and Jacob Borislow.</span></p>
<p><b><em>Trinity College Entryway into College Main Square:</em> </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The narrow entryway of Trinity College condenses and directs the stream of people entering and departing the campus directly down its center. Directly inside the entryway is a covered stone and wood structure. People linger here to take photos of the main square from inside the arched doorway. There are ads and flyers all along the walls, but no one appears remotely interested in stopping to read them. For people exiting campus, this archway is treated as a transitional space that needs no pause; their goal is to leave and they are focused in the direction they are headed. However, those entering campus pause for few moments to take a picture of the tower that can be seen through the archway, before proceeding closer to the tower itself. In short, though these two groups of people are in the same physical locale at the same time, the context causes them to experience the same spot as a different “place.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As per the typical weather in Ireland, the air is sharp and cold. People in the space do not indicate an obvious discomfort due to the weather. Many people are situated in groups, and those who are individual appear to walk with a clear destination in mind. Multiple languages can can be heard, and many people have their phones out taking photos. Most notable is the rows of bikes lining the black chain fences that surround the green lawns on the edges of the main square. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Without intention, nearly all photos and videos that we took had a bike (or many bikes) in the frame, exhibiting bikes as a defining characteristic of the Trinity College campus. If mobile media is defined as something you take with you that contributes to your identity, a bike could be considered a form of mobile media. In the case of Trinity College, it is the form of mobile media that defines Trinity College as a “place.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You would never see all those bikes ridden at the same time&#8211;people are always coming and going. As soon as someone comes and unlocks their bike, someone else will come and put their bike in its place. It illustrates that this particularly busy place is constantly moving. Some of the bikes were brightly colored, or customized in some way, illustrating the identity and personality of each bike owner. However, it is not just what </span><span style="font-weight: 400">the bike looks like, but where the bike </span><i style="font-family: inherit;font-weight: inherit"><span style="font-weight: 400">is</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> that tells you about the person. Where they choose to lock up their bike (the most convenient place, the safest place, the most popular place, etc.) reveals even more about the owner’s identity.</span></p>
<p><em><b>Library Lawn/Book of Kells Courtyard:</b></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There are less groups here and more walking individuals&#8211;mostly students, as indicated by their backpacks and the general attitude they have toward the space. For example, people can be seen sitting on the steps with their books, walking into the library, lounging on the benches, kissing on the benches, etc. In other words, it is a place of general non-movement. It is more of a slow moving, sitting space, as demonstrated by the lawn’s absence of bikes, in contrast to the fast pace of the college’s main square, where bikes are present and people are focused on walking as opposed to resting. Although walking within the library lawn could be argued as a movement, walking here is just traveling to a place of non-movement as one sits down to read or study.  </span></p>
<p><em><b>Berkeley Library Pedestal:</b></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The centerpiece of the pedestal outside of Berkeley Library is a large brass globe that spins when pushed. The only bikes in sight are along the back wall of the stone pedestal in the far left corner, farthest from the library entrance and leaning on a wall, a place not seemingly meant for bikes. The small cluster of bikes are indicative of the way people navigate through the space and are permitted to do so. By leaving your bike somewhere that is not the designated place to leave a bike, you are changing the landscape to fit your needs. This is illustrative of mobile media as one’s needs are a part of their person and it is also used to adapt the physical space to one’s own comfort. People are encouraged to place their bikes closest to the exit off the pedestal and closest to the road even though this position is farther from the library exit.</span></p>
<p><em><b>Road &amp; General Area off of Berkeley Library Pedestal:</b></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A cobblestone pathway and lawn on the right is framed by the same black chain fences found in the college’s main square. This “place” exists as a prelude to the college’s bustling main square while simultaneously not fully leaving the non-movement of the library. Bikes line these chain fences shoulder to shoulder and although not</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400"> quite</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> as densely packed as those in the college’s main square, they are at the fringe&#8211;waiting to be put into the movement of the main square, but concurrently existing within the slower non-movement of the library pedestal.</span></p>

<p><em><strong>Section Two: Interviews</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Sasha&#8217;s Interview</strong></em></p>
<p>Domestication, as defined by Bertel “emphasizes the active role of individuals and groups in shaping technologies as they are integrated into the contexts and practices of everyday life” (Bertel, 2017), or more simply, refers to how people, either as individuals or groups change or accommodate their behavior to adapt to the technologies that have become a common occurrence. In regards to the smartphone specifically, domestication theory looks at how we have adjusted our habits, wants and priorities—and even the very focus of our lives to integrate or “domesticate” the smartphone.</p>
<p>When asking Jacob when he uses his phone he thought for a moment, then said succinctly “When I wake up, when I eat, when I go to bed” implying that he had cleanly set times in which he tended to use his phone adding that “I don’t typically multi-task.” This seemed to indicate that at some level Jacob had an awareness of the domestication he applied to his smartphone, adding, “I’m not that glued to my smartphone, honestly.”</p>
<p>This led to the question of what he mainly used his phone for. This answer was also rather concise: “Facebook and any messages, on any platform.” Jacob also added with a laugh that sometimes he will watch “one YouTube video if I need motivation to get out of bed.” When asked about how often he feels compelled to check Facebook or such said messages, he replied “I don’t typically walk down the street looking at Facebook. Unless I get a message and I’m like ooh—who’s messaging me?” This illustrates a habit that arises from the domestication of the smartphone—in that the curiosity that arises from the normal presence of the smartphone dictates that since you can receive a message anytime, anywhere, if Jacob is messaged, it is natural to know who at hat exact moment in time is thinking of him and for what reason.</p>
<p>Jacob wears a watch, so there is also no reason for him to use his phone. Although the phone is perfectly capable of telling time and would be “less bulk” to carry around, the watch clearly brings him enjoyment, so there is no reason to abandon it. The smartphone then, has not caused Jacob to change things within his life that he enjoys—rather, it has been domesticated into Jacob’s life as an object of convenience for things that he does not mind changing.</p>
<p>The functions that Jacob uses most often are YouTube with Facebook (“Stuff I care about is news. Its my news source”) being a close second. Jacob could easily name the most well-known YouTubers, and enthusiastically listed off the favorites that he likes to follow. He stated that he really enjoys pop-culture and pop-culture theory, implying that it was enjoyable to see others undergoing as well as contributing to that same enjoyment. When asked why YouTube and mobile access to YouTube was so important to him he replied, “It’s entertaining. Why is YouTube…? I’ve never really thought about it.” He took a pause. “It improves my experience—like if I’m eating food….Why would you watch other people playing games? You do it for the people.” It is particularly interesting that Jacob phrased it in this, particularly because he has had earlier clarified that when he is eating at a restaurant alone he typically watches YouTube videos, as he finds that it improves his eating enjoyment.</p>
<p>He lamented the “lazy” stigma often put upon YouTubers, emphasizing through logical argument how much time, energy, and technical work it takes to produce videos multiple times a week. Clearly, he understands the YouTuber schedule, and has a clear grasp on the economic pressures of YouTube platform. While he could easily obtain such content on a laptop (and he does) having YouTube in the mobile capacity enables him to integrate himself into the YouTube world through the domestication use of his phone. In mobile form, he almost literally has the capacity to “consume” it, as paralleled by his utilizing the platform as he eats solitary. This factor is not insignificant, as he both mentioned it himself and as it eating is typically a “stationary” moment. I began to pick up a pattern that it is when Jacob is most stationary that he is also the most mobile.</p>
<p>Communication and the content then, seem to be his primary mobile uses. “I’m definitely someone who takes in more content then he creates. It is quite rare when I post anything on Facebook. Or like anything actually.” Rather, Jacob’s phone is an illustration of his phone use as it pertains to his tastes, as well as to how his mind works in organizing his communication. He organized his phone thusly: his Siri is male and British, factors set by Jacob who has it call him “Master Jacob, so it could be my Alfred” to satisfy his own personal joke as well as remind him of the things he likes. “All my social media apps are in a group, even if I don’t use them all”, he continues implying that he prefers an orderly mobile space, even if it isn’t “clean”—for example, the fact that he does not use them all, and as he shifted through his phone he exclaimed “Oh, I forgot I had Akinator.” He stated, “I don’t really buy apps, so I put it towards personalized ringtones. When I put someone’s number, I put a picture of them that I affiliate with. Like some guy who likes James Bond I put the James Bond theme song.” Once again, an illustration of how he uses the phone to apply his passions to everyday life.</p>
<p>The physical organization of Jacob’s phone is a hard cover case with a stand. Once again, this is indicative of what he uses his phone for most: ease of watching YouTube videos. “I prefer a medium bulkiness. Homepage wallpaper—I have to change it honestly, it’s a little old—it Carnage from Spiderman. My homepage: It’s Bullet Club—It’s a Japanese wrestling club. Also, a bunch of them are nerds—one of them is a YouTuber with a lot of subscribers who I follow.” Both the physical and software attributes of his phone are applied, or domesticated, by Jacob himself. The phone is not only in his life, but is fully integrated within it—it is used to access his passions, and said use is displayed physically as a result of how he uses it. Even the status in which he keeps his phone—silent, tells us something of here Jacob’s mind is: “I always have my phone on silent. It’s easier. Like when a movie is starting I don’t have to remember to turn it off.” Media and entertainment then (movies) and the proper etiquette involving them appear to have an influence on how he uses the settings.</p>
<p>He didn’t seem too particularly fussy over any certain type of function of a phone. Jacob’s main requirements for a phone are that it works and has enough memory. When asked if there were any features he did not like he replied “My newer phone I did the fingerprint scan. I kind of regretted it after I gave Apple my fingerprint scan. I mean of course they say they don’t keep it on record but…” he trailed off and we shared that suspicious look one sometimes gives the computer when accessing pirated content, or when glancing at the shady camera on the back wall of a supermarket. Once domesticated, a phone can feel so incredibly personal it is easy to forget that such personalization, such telling aspects of your identity are not only being accessed by you, but received by those around you—and perhaps most invisibly, by those who give you the means to personalize.</p>

<p><em><strong>Jacob&#8217;s Interview </strong></em></p>
<p>The mobile phone has a large influence on S’s life and there are a variety of<br />
ways that her cell phone has been domesticated into being an integral aspect for her.<br />
According to Haddon (2017), an analysis of domestication &#8220;&#8230;helps to make sense of<br />
people&#8217;s engagement with technologies through understanding the broader context of<br />
their lives [including] their uses of the technologies, the location and timing of that use<br />
and how and why they talk about or otherwise display their devices and services. That<br />
entails understanding people&#8217;s circumstances, their biographies, the meanings that ICTs<br />
have for them and, as part of this, their relations and negotiations with others&#8221; (Haddon<br />
2017, Pg. 71). As Haddon notes, the domesticated usage of technologies does not<br />
simply entail the traditional and “normal” uses but any uses that have the technology be<br />
adapted into a person’s life in any shape and form. As will be revealed, S uses her<br />
phone in a variety of traditional and nontraditional ways all of which demonstrate her<br />
domestication of her phone into her life to a very great extent. A nontraditional use of<br />
her phone can be seen in the first way that it is incorporated into S’s life.<br />
The first and most basic way that the mobile phone factors into S’s life is she<br />
self-describes it as always being in her hand whenever possible. Even if the phone is<br />
not being used and is off, S still feels the need to keep it in her hand. Admittedly,<br />
the reason for it always being in her hand is because she feels that she must always<br />
have something to do with her hands no matter what it is. The fact that her object of<br />
choice to put in her hands is her mobile phone proves how it has been domesticated<br />
into serving an important purpose not originally intended but still deemed integral. The<br />
phone is used in a way mobile phones aren’t typically used with an emphasis on its use<br />
as a physical object rather than what it digitally is capable of.<br />
Moving on to the actual technological and digital usage of her mobile phone,<br />
S frequents all the expected apps including Facebook and Instagram. She mostly<br />
observes and gets her knowledge of what’s going on with her friends from the apps.<br />
This has made it so S doesn’t have to ask her friends what they’ve been up to and<br />
can instead with the press of a button and slide of a thumb know instantly. When she<br />
does post, her content mostly consists of selfies and pictures of her friends as she<br />
admits that she feels it proves to the world (or at least all her followers) that she hangs<br />
out with people. Her mobile phone has been domesticated into being her path to<br />
self-verification as it admittedly has been for many people that have been researched.<br />
As Elliott &amp; Urry have written about in their article “New Technologies, New Mobilities”,<br />
emotions and therefore general identity have been restructured thanks to more of a<br />
person’s life being a digital life (Elliott &amp; Urry, Pg. 35). S is clearly not the minority<br />
in the usage of her phone to get satisfaction and connections in this new world where<br />
digital interactions have real consequences that shape who a person is and how they<br />
feel. If someone is not careful, their life can be too shaped around their phone and<br />
before long their phone and digital presence is all they are in life.<br />
The first thing S does when she wakes up is to immediately check the apps<br />
with the most notifications demonstrating how an aspect of her life is adapted around<br />
the presence of the phone and her digital presence on the technology. As with many<br />
people, S adapted her phone menu to fit her needs and features the apps she uses<br />
the most on the main screen along with a group of apps paired together that are the<br />
apps she uses less but still has usage for such as the MyTaxi and photo editing apps.<br />
The arrangement of apps is for the same reason that her phone is always put in the<br />
same spot at night, for the ease of it demonstrating that she has molded her phone in a<br />
similar way to how she has admittedly molded her life, to make it as easy and the least<br />
stressful as possible. S&#8217;s portable charger has been domesticated into being an<br />
integral part of what she chooses to carry with her as she goes about her day.<br />
The reason S chooses to carry around her portable charger is especially<br />
interesting and important is, for a girl like S who has little to no pockets, she must<br />
be very picky about what she chooses to have as it easily stacks up. The portable<br />
charger is so integral to S’s life that it has a priority over many other items as not<br />
having it causes her to be very stressed. The stress comes from the feeling that if her<br />
phone is at less than 70%, it’s dead to her as well as the belief that the phone can’t die<br />
or else “it feels like it would have abandoned me”. While she admits nothing traumatic<br />
would happen it still causes her a great deal of stress and the fact that a simple plastic<br />
object that powers another manufactured object can be the cause of such stress for her<br />
demonstrates the power of the domestication of technology.</p>

<p><em><strong>Steph&#8217;s Interview</strong></em></p>
<p>The person I interviewed (here on out referred to as “Alex”) was a particularly interesting case, as they do not regularly use a smartphone. Because of this, I decided to come up with some alternative questions, in the event that some of the provided questions would be rendered irrelevant to their specific experience. Unlike most millennial&#8217;s, Alex does not use a smartphone in their daily life. Instead, they use a Tracfone. The Tracfone has no apps, and no touch screen; it is essentially the most basic flip phone, that can be used just to text and call.</p>
<p>So why doesn’t Alex use a smartphone, when so many of their peers do? They detailed a few reasons. The first being that they never felt like they “needed” a cell phone at all, so by extension they never felt like they needed a smartphone. Alex thinks that generally, smartphones are “useless” to living, so they never felt compelled to buy something they didn’t feel a use for. They feel as though smartphones provide entertainment value, not survival value. Many people are so attached to their smartphones that they feel helpless in situations without them, however Alex firmly believes that they can can survive without a phone, and over the years they have never once felt compelled to “convert” to being a smartphone user. As a strong believer in their own self-sufficiency, Alex never wanted to depend on a machine built by someone else. Their main worry about using a smartphone would be the risk of becoming codependent on an inanimate device. They always want to maintain self-control and avoid the domestication of technology within their life. If smartphone technology became integrated within Alex’s daily routines and practices, that ideal of technological minimalism could be compromised.</p>
<p>Of course, Alex does use their Tracfone to communicate with the important people in their life. Yet even with the Tracfone, they don’t use it frivolously, and the frequency of use depends on context. For a specific example, last semester Alex had a group project in which they frequently had to communicate with their partner, so they used their phone for texting much more than they usually would. They would text the partner to discuss meeting or give an update, but that would be all. In terms of texting close friends, Alex prefers to call over text. They will call someone for a specific purpose, like confirming a plan, or other times just to chat, sometimes for a few hours. However, Alex strongly dislikes texting chit-chat; once everything that needed to be said has been said, they have no desire to continue idle banter over text. They have specific friends that they will call on their Tracfone most frequently, however they would always prefer to speak with friends in person given the situation allows for it (time,distance etc.). They also own a landline at school to call their mother, and state that they find the quality to be better.</p>
<p>In terms of communicating with their parents, that has never been a struggle. Alex got their first phone (the same Tracfone) at 18 years old, right before college. Growing up an only child, Alex’s parents could easily keep track of them, and never like their safety was compromised without a phone. In high school, they had a good group of friends and never felt like they missed out socially; they were always included in plans even without being easily contacted through a cell phone/texting. In college, Alex feels that any of their friendships that have come and gone are not the result of technology, but rather personal growth and change, and that most friendships are even stronger now. They may not be a part of group chats, or might miss inside jokes, but good friends will always keep Alex in the loop.</p>
<p>One very positive thing Alex also mentioned about not having a smartphone is that they avoid all of the negativity and drama that comes with social media, and not having be concerned with likes and followers and anything else that superficial and distracting from the real world. When Alex is out and about in the world, they want to actually enjoy it, and not be staring into the tiny screen in their hands. Because Alex doesn’t carry a smartphone with them when they go out, they have learned to be resourceful and to rely on their own set of skills instead of apps for everything. For example, they don’t need a tip calculator app, because they learned mental math tricks to figure it out quickly. When traveling or exploring, they don’t need Google/Apple Maps because they have good sense of direction, and can navigate using a paper map very well. They also feel like not having a smartphone makes them more organized, because they have learned to utilize a paper calendar and planner. They look at it every day and are never late to any appointments. They rely on their own memory and efficiency, as opposed to constant push notifications popping on their screen to remind them of their priorities. Alex feels as though having a smartphone would actually cause them more stress and anxiety, as it would just be cluttered and distracting.</p>
<p>However, there are some technological devices that Alex does use for entertainment and distraction. They have an MP3 player for listening to music. And aside from homework, emails, and other school/work related things, they use their computer for watching videos on youtube, internet window shopping, gaming etc. They also game on their PS3 and Nintendo DS. They explained how they think video games are a lot like phones, and can be great to enjoy in moderation. Alex’s views are not anti-technology, but rather anti-human dependence on smartphones. If people have weak self-control, have debilitating insecurities, or a strong need for validation, then their smartphones may be doing much more harm than good. Alex believes that sometimes we let smartphones use us, instead of us using it. Alex is proof that smartphone technology does not have to be domesticated into our everyday lives if we do not wish to allow it. Humans can be perfectly content, and even thrive, without the constant presence of a smartphone.</p>
