<p>RBR-TVBR. (2011, April, 25). In-car streaming perceptions, misperceptions examined. <em>Radio Broadcasting Report.</em> Retrieved from http://www.rbr.com/radio/in-car-streaming-numbers-perceptions-misperceptions-examined.html</p>
<p>With the increasing technological growth and use of internet-streaming radio stations such as Pandora, iHeartRadio, and other cloud-based sites, the public still recognizes that the production and distribution of “over-the-air” terrestrial radio remains one of the most used media outlets while driving.  In a recent Radio Broadcasting Report article, it was made known through a survey of 18-44 year olds, that having streaming-internet radio in cars is not a threat at all to the AM/FM radio stations, or even Sirius/XM.  &#8220;The good news is most users of in-car streaming radio continue to use over-the-air radio extensively&#8221; (rbr.com).</p>
<p><span id="more-1171"></span></p>
<p>Using the Automobile Industry as one of their linking pins, internet streaming radio is trying hard to stream themselves over other industries.  Maybe for the satisfaction of becoming a vertically integrated industry, the internet might be a little over zealous when trying to take over multiple media outlets.  The majority of these blogs have focused on the fact that internet radio sites like Pandora, iHeartRadio and many others are becoming major exhibitors for not only just music, but the recording industry itself.  The popularity of streaming internet stations in the car mostly comes from the linking pin of the cellphone industry.  People are able to buy cables that will simply connect their smartphone to the radio.  They won&#8217;t need to buy a full dashboard radio system that will connect their internet radio to the car.  &#8220;It is thought that most of that listening still occurs at home or at work on computers connected to the internet because of the perceived difficulties related to connecting to the internet in the car&#8221; (rbr.com).  When surveys are taken to see how many people are listening to internet radio, we cannot assume that it is just for the car, all these other media outlets still need to be taken into account.</p>
<p>Within the article there are perceptions noted that describe how certain industry and power roles are concerned with these internet radio stations taking over.  The internet might be able to vertically integrate themselves as producers, distributors, and exhibitors due to the fact that our information age has taken rise <em>because</em> of the internet.  To understand the perceptions (or misperceptions) of the internet radio streaming in cars, it would be better to read the <a href="http://www.rbr.com/radio/in-car-streaming-numbers-perceptions-misperceptions-examined.html">article</a> in full.  But in short the four perceptions are: that streaming is not yet happening in the car, once streaming becomes widely available in cars terrestrial radio will be dead, people won&#8217;t pay for an in-dash solution, consumers will want more pre-sets with in-dash systems.</p>
<p>Although this might be a huge exhibitor power role in the future, in-dash internet radio systems need a lot of adjustment to satisfy the consumer.  Although the client power role of the advertisers might see this as a great deal of business for them, only having one automobile producer and distributor for an internet radio system (Ford and its SYNC system) limits the possibility of substantial profit and growth.</p>

<p>Clear Channel Radio (1, March, 2011). <span style="font-family: Helvetica;font-size: 12px">Clear Channel Radio Announces Acquisition of Thumbplay’s Cloud-Based Music Business. Retrieved from <a href="http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20110228007392/en/Clear-Channel-Radio-Announces-Acquisition-Thumbplay’s-Cloud-Based">http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20110228007392/en/Clear-Channel-Radio-Announces-Acquisition-Thumbplay’s-Cloud-Based</a></span></p>
<p>Leading our country&#8217;s digital and terrestrial radio, Clear Channel Radio has added a new technical function to their growing iHeartRadio.  Thumbplay Inc. is a new cloud-based technology that is being combined to CC&#8217;s iHeartRadio which has 750 channels in 150 cities, released on March 1, 2011.  iHeartRadio has been recently launched, but it is assumed to be the leading online/mobile radio station of our century.  This site is offering music that is streaming/downloading for a monthly subscription of $9.99 a month.  A pandora-like station, Thumbplay music is controlled by its listeners.  Radio stations stream with no commercials, and music can be added to a customized playlist.<span id="more-961"></span></p>
<p>Not only is Clear Channel enhancing their exhibitor role, they are using the auxiliary power role of Thumbplay&#8217;s cloud-based technology.  They are reaching the ideals of collaboration with local radio stations, which is needed for local radio stations to survive.  Not only are listeners able to create their own playlists, they are still able to stream their favorite local radio stations from their iPhone, Android, Blackberry&#8217;s, and Windows 7 phones.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thumbplay (which charges 9.99 per month) will also give Clear Channel the capability to deploy a variety of subscription services as it moves to leverage its radio assets across all digital platforms, including the Internet, automotive and mobile devices. Remember, <a href="http://www.rbr.com/features/ideas-working-now/clear-channels-iheartradio-hits-the-road.html" target="_blank">Toyota will integrate Clear Channel’s iheartradio</a> mobile app into select models starting this year.&#8221;  Not only does this show a linking-pin to the automotive industry, it establishes Thumbplay as a huge exhibitor role, also as client based because of the subscription money needed to support it.  John Hogan, CEO of Clear Channel, states in his business release that &#8220;iHeartRadio will build on our position as the leaders in digital radio, offering an unparalleled combination of features and reach &#8212; to our listeners, advertisers, artists, music labels, and other partners – not available anywhere else.&#8221;</p>
