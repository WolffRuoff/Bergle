While magazines from the last thirty years are now archived and readily accessible through online subscription aggregrators like Academic Search Premier (Ebsco) and LexisNexis Academic, accessing those pre-1980 periodicals for historical purposes has been nearly impossible without (yes, it&#8217;s true) going to the olive green volumes of the Reader&#8217;s Guide.<\/p>\n<p>But this has all changed&#8211;for the better. Muhlenberg College affiliates can now access all the Reader&#8217;s Guide indexing online through<a href=\"http:\/\/0-vnweb.hwwilsonweb.com.library.muhlenberg.edu\/hww\/jumpstart.jhtml?prod=RGR\">\u00a0Readers Guide Retrospective<\/a>\u00a0(1890-1982).
