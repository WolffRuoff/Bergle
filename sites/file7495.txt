								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the article <em>The digital identity divide: how technology knowledge impacts college students</em> by Joanna Goode, the divides between technology usage of certain ethnic, gender, and socioeconomic groups. One thing that stood out was the fact that, regardless of race, lower income households had less technology exposure than households with a higher income. Students from those families do not have the “boost” in the job market and college search. With the common application online and many more colleges using it, those with the greater technological exposure have a greater chance to get the jobs and colleges they want. Even in school, the deficiency of technology usage is not harmful. The article talks about a girl named Lara. It reads: her “low technology proficiency haunts her academic career.” Most teachers assume that students automatically know how to use technology which may exclude some students. Although these students are not well versed in technology, they actively embrace it. Going back to Lara, the article reads: “this low level of technology knowledge did not translate into negative attitudes toward technology, however. She loves computers…” which means that these students may have an ability to accept new technology while the older generations are not as inclined to do so. This could link to the ability of younger people to pick up new things quickly while the old dogs aren’t able to learn those new tricks the puppies can. Fortunately, schools are getting better with teaching students to use technology more efficiently, albeit at a slower pace than technology is progressing but it’s progress none the less.</p>
