								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Social media is a major part of my life. Quite frankly, I can&#8217;t remember the last time I&#8217;ve gone a full day without using social media. Social media gives me this sense of power and control because it allows me to show off my profile to the public. Though it isn&#8217;t a palpable object, social media almost feels like a possession, despite the fact that I share it with millions of people. It feels like my own possession because I have control over the people I follow, the posts that I like, and more. After this week&#8217;s discussion with Jim Groom, as well as the assigned reading, I&#8217;m starting to second guess the amount of trust I put into social media. Not only that, but I&#8217;m beginning to realize that the companies of social media profit from us using social media just as much as we do.</p>
<p><em>The best things in life are free?</em> Think again. According to Jim Groom, any website or app that is free entails that there is no privacy. This is a tactic of the social media companies because it attracts more people to sign up since there&#8217;s no cost. But it turns out that this is a loophole: the cost is your personal privacy. The more you use social media, the more of your &#8220;history&#8221; it records. On apps such as Instagram, nobody really knows who exactly controls your history. Though it is concerning that private and important information can be controlled by social media companies, many users (including myself) continue to take a risk and trust these companies.</p>
<p>These companies also manipulate us by making us think that they are providing for us, but in reality we are providing for them. According to Audrey Watters, &#8220;our content and our data, shared publicly, become theirs to profit from” (Watters 2016). In her article, Watters discusses how us users are the ones working for social media companies. This strikes me because when I sign up for a social media account, I don&#8217;t sign up to work for them&#8230;I sign up for them to work for me.</p>
