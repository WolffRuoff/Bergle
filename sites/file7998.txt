								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Social media, particularly Twitter, has taken politics by storm. Recently, politicians have utilized social media as a way to gain publicity and to voice their opinions on current events. The craze for politicians to start using social media began in 2008 when President Obama posted on Instagram about an upcoming trip to Alaska, racking up thousands of ‘likes’ and ‘comments’ from millions of people around the world. After this, more politicians began using their own forms of social media to connect with people in attempt to gain popularity for upcoming events, such as the presidential election. For example, “Ted Cruz live-streams his appearances on Periscope. Marco Rubio broadcasts ‘Snapchat Stories’ at stops along the trail. Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush spar over student debt on Twitter. Rand Paul and Lindsey Graham produce goofy YouTube videos. Even grumpy old Bernie Sanders has attracted nearly two million likers on Facebook, leading the <em>New York Times</em> to dub him “a king of social media” (Carr, 2015). Politicians have realized that social media platforms are a very easy way to connect with others, thus causing social media to have a “HUGE” impact on politics, as Presidential candidate Donald Trump would say.</p>
<p>Although social media can be one person’s road to fame, it can also attract unwanted attention if one is not cautious about what they say on social media. Once somebody posts a post, or tweets a tweet, it is forever online, even if they are given the option to delete it. Sometimes those posts come back to haunt the people that posted them in the first place. A perfect example of something that was thought to be forgotten is the recent video that shows Donald Trump speaking ‘locker room’ talk with colleagues which was taped over 10 years ago in 2005. Donald Trump has been hurt tremendously by this in the Presidential election. Some deem Donald Trump as a “god” on social media for the way he issues provocative messages at the perfect moments, giving his 12.4 million twitter followers something to react to, giving him an abundance of attention with every tweet he sends out. Regardless, one of the biggest dangers of social media is being careful about what you say and when you say it, because you never know when the camera might be rolling.</p>
<p>With social media being the main form of communication between people ages 16-25, politicians are smart to be utilizing different platforms in order to send their message out to people of that age range. On the edge of being able to vote, 16 and 17-year-old kids are using social media to talk to friends, connect with celebrities and in some cases, talk to strangers. It is almost impossible to think that they would not pay attention to the messages that politicians are sending out to capture their attention.</p>
<p>Some politicians may seem different in person or on live television compared to how they may seem on social media. Often times people will put their best foot forward on social media, making their social media self the best version of themselves. I have experienced this personally and have seen others do the same. There is a vast difference between somebody on social media and somebody in person. On social media, there is so much time to edit something or practice what you want to post before you post it. There are so many ways to make it ‘perfect,’ so that one can often appear different than what they may appear in the current moment. The way that social media has influenced politics is exciting, to say the least. It seems necessary for politicians to be involved in some form of social media if they want to be successful. I can only think that social media will continue to take over politics, as this might be the beginning of social media in politics.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cyberbullying is the use of electronic communication to bully a person, typically by sending messages of an intimidating or threatening nature. According to Pew, &#8220;About one third (32%) of all teenagers who use the internet say they have been targets of a range of annoying and potentially menacing online activities &#8211; such as receiving threatening messages; having their private emails or text messages forwarded without consent; having an embarrassing picture posted without permission; or having rumors about them spread online&#8221;. This study was done in 2006; if this study was done today I believe that the percentage of people that have been bullied online would be higher. Social media has become more popular and there are more social medias out there making it more accessible for bullies to target people online.</p>
<p>To no surprise cyberbullying is more common among girls. Girls are pettier and get involved in drama much more than boys do. Girls can also be very passive to one another and take it online instead so they do not need to face the person. Other than being passive, girls get jealous very easily. So if they think a girl is so great and &#8220;perfect&#8221; they will want to find something wrong with her and try to put her down to make her feel bad. Society puts a lot of pressure on girls to be &#8220;perfect&#8221;, even though there is no such thing. Girls want to be the best; it is a constant competition with other girls. Instead of building each other up (as we should), it is often seen that girls try to tear one another down.</p>
<p>Also the article says that intense Internet users are bullied more. The situation is probably the more you use the Internet, the more one uses social media and is posting more. People judge everything, so if they do not like your post for some reason they may feel the need to let you know.</p>
<p>Lastly, I was very shocked to read that bullying happens more often offline. I feel like now a day most bullying happens online. Again, this article is from 2006 so it could be the other way around now. The screen gives people something to hide behind and most likely say things that they would not say in person.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every person has an image of what a gamer looks like, and unfortunately, many opinions are based off of misconceptions. It may be difficult to understand a gamer from a non-gamer’s perspective, and Maeve Duggan of the Pew Research Center proves that many people are misinformed about gaming. In most of the infographics, those who answered “unsure” made up an unsettling portion of the population (around 20%); it made me question the validity of the results. Even those who identify as gamers may have stereotypes about gaming. According to the survey, “men and women are equally likely to assume that most video game players are men regardless of whether they themselves play games” (Duggan, 2015, p. 3). I have though about this stigma as it applies to my own life, because I used to (and sometimes still do) play games a lot. I have had a lot of boys respond “Oh, that’s cool” when I tell them I play games, but I feel like there is a different reaction if a male identifies as a gamer. He is generally perceived as lazy, as if all he does is play games. Yet, when a female plays games, she is seen as more masculine and that is “cool”? Although these are generalizations, I find these things true in my own life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, I can only imagine that a the idea of a female gamer has become more common over the past decade. As it becomes more and more acceptable for a female to act masculine and vice versa, the stigma of gaming is changing. Just eight years ago, the ratio of males to females in terms of gamers was 13:7, when now it is practically equal (Lenhart, 2008, p.1). I think that this stereotype will begin to fade as time goes on. It will become “normal” for a girl to identify as gamer. Eliminating sexist stigmas like this will eventually lead to more equality for all people. The longer people hold on to ideas, the longer it will take us to progress as a society. So, next time a female tells you she plays games, do not think of it as abnormal, consider her like any other gamer.</p>
