<p>Once upon a time, the task of finding a seat in the theater after the movie had already begun proved to be an impossible task. However, now finding an empty seat is becoming less of a challenge. It has been a grim first quarter of the year for both Hollywood studios and theater owners. For every single weekend of the year thus far, box office revenues have dropped from the equivalent weekends in 2010. At CinemaCon, a convention of the National Association of Theater Owners (NATO) that recently took place in Las Vegas, the box office decline was a prominent topic of conversation.  Not only are consumer habits changing constantly, but last year&#8217;s box office hits &#8220;Avatar&#8221; (2009) and &#8220;Alice in Wonderland&#8221; (2010) drove the box office to record highs during the first half of 2010. And so far this year, there has been a lack of &#8220;event films&#8221; able to rake in large numbers of ticket sales and attract audiences in a way comparable to last year. <span id="more-1062"></span></p>
<p>At CinemaCon, much of the conference&#8217;s discussion has centered around hopes that this summer&#8217;s films will help erase some of the box office deficit. With known properties and sequels such as &#8220;Scream 4,&#8221; &#8220;Fast Five,&#8221; &#8220;Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,&#8221; &#8220;The Hangover Part II,&#8221; &#8220;Cars 2,&#8221; &#8220;Transformers 3,&#8221; and the final installment of &#8220;Harry Potter&#8221; due in theaters between now and July, Hollywood is hoping that moviegoers will be lured back to theaters to see follow-ups to previous successes.  Several of the major studios, including Paramount, DreamWorks, Disney, Warner Bros. and Lionsgate showcased some of their upcoming products at the convention. Sony screened an entire film, the July comedy &#8220;Zookeeper&#8221; starring Kevin James.</p>
<p>CinemaCon, which used to be known as ShoWest, conducted its first-ever conference under that name this year. In an effort to increase studio participation at the conference and encourage attendance among smaller film exhibitors, NATO will begin managing the conference on a non-profit basis. During a time when decreased attendance and other factors have contributed more than ever to box office declines, CinemaCon was an important week for exhibitors as they discussed strategies and changing consumer habits. &#8220;In this day and age, with so many ancillary avenues fighting for the leisure dollar, we have to be at the top of our game,&#8221; said CinemaCon managing director Mitch Neuhauser. &#8220;That&#8217;s really what we&#8217;re keying the conference on: What does it take?&#8221;</p>
<p>As we discussed in our blog last week, a new premium video-on-demand service is proving controversial in the motion picture industry. Making feature films available on demand in a relatively short window following release, this service was a notable point of conversation about CinemaCon. The video-on-demand service is reflective of some of the changes happening within the entertainment industry that could affect how consumers are willing to spend their money. It remains to be seen what kind of impact this specific service will actually have on box office revenues, but it seems clear at this point in time that exhibitors and studios are both counting on the box office receiving a much-needed shot in the arm.</p>
<p>The sheer number of films being released in this summer based on products that previously saw success is an indication that studios are hoping familiarity will bring people back into movie theaters. CinemaCon is a clear example of a power role attempting to maintain their grip on the industry. Exhibitors spent the entire week of CinemaCon discussing the ins and outs of the industry and the current state of box office sales. CinemaCon was an outlet that allowed not only the screening of footage but gave exhibitors and studios a chance to interact. With the common goal of boosting box office and erasing some of the industry&#8217;s current fears, exhibitors and studios used CinemaCon as an opportunity to plan for the future.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Graser, Marc. (2011, March 31). WB, Sony, U, and Fox cue premium VOD. <em>Variety</em>. Retrieved from <a href="http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118034714">http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118034714</a>.<a href="http://mediaindustries11.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/03/video-on-demand-image-photoshop.jpg"><br />
</a></p>
<p><a href="http://mediaindustries11.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/03/home_theter_04-535x354.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1018" src="http://mediaindustries11.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/03/home_theter_04-535x354-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a>In a controversial business venture that could significantly impact the film industry and its audiences, four major film studios have announced their involvement in the launch of Home Premiere, a premium video-on-demand service for feature films. Beginning next month, Warner Bros., Sony, Universal and 20th Century Fox will offer recently released theatrical films for a $30 fee over a two-to-three day viewing period, at the discretion of each particular studio. Several cable systems will offer the service, with DirecTV launching it initially to its 20 million customers. Warner Bros.&#8217; action thriller &#8220;Unknown&#8221; (2011) and Sony&#8217;s romantic comedy &#8220;Just Go With It&#8221; (2011) will be the first major releases offered via Home Premiere. While discussing the reasons this endeavor has come to fruition, studios have argued that offering these films for the $30 rate 60 days after theatrical release will <em>not</em> harm either box office returns or the financial stability of exhibitors, claiming that films make most of their money at the box office within the first three months. Further, these studios claim that the expense of a night out at the movies for families has harmed them financially between the cost of concessions, tickets, and possible babysitters, and this VOD service seeks to appease this by offering an opportunity to view relatively recent films at a cost that would be lower than an average trip to the theater.<span id="more-1016"></span></p>
<p>However, exhibitors and NATO (the National Association of Theater Owners) have expressed disappointment and anger over their fears of this premium VOD plan having a negative effect on theaters. In a statement, a NATO spokesman recently said, &#8220;They risk damaging theatrical revenues without actually delivering what  the home consumer seems to want, which is flexibility, portability and a  low price. These plans fundamentally alter the economic relationship  between exhibitors, filmmakers and producers, and the studios taking  part in this misguided venture.&#8221; In other words, a prominent concern of the exhibition viewpoint of the industry regards possible repercussions this new service could have on theatrical box office revenues.</p>
<p>Several theater chains, including Regal Entertainment, have threatened studios with the possibility of not releasing particular films if they are released on demand just six weeks after opening. Hypothetically, if Regal were to actually go through with this, it would have a devastating effect on nearly all theatrical grosses, as Regal is the largest theater chain in the U.S. When DirecTV initially proposed the VOD launch in February, they had mentioned the possibility of a short four-to-six week window between theatrical release and VOD release. This was when Regal threatened a boycott, and the four major studios had to intervene and talk DirecTV into lengthening the window to 60 days.</p>
<p>This is a striking example of power roles at work in the industry of motion pictures. In terms of the agreement to extend the window to 60 days from roughly 40, the exhibitors wielded their power over the distributors. Without the cooperation of Regal, the nation&#8217;s most prominent movie exhibitor chain, the studios would stand to lose millions of dollars in this risky endeavor. Although the exhibitors and NATO still seem unsure of Home Premiere&#8217;s possible financial implications, they are nonetheless on board with it, at least for now. It remains to be seen what the future holds for this new service, and whether it will be profitable overall or a financial bust. In the meantime, however, the fight between the different entities involved (specifically the exhibitors and distributors) has revealed a great deal of the number of compromises that go on behind the scenes in the motion picture industry.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Kin<a href="http://mediaindustries11.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/03/The-Kings-Censored-Speech.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-972" src="http://mediaindustries11.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/03/The-Kings-Censored-Speech-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a>g&#8217;s Speech,&#8221; the most recent winner of the Academy Award for Best Picture, will undergo a ratings facelift on Friday, April 1. The Weinstein Co., the film&#8217;s distributing studio, announced that they will replace all R-rated prints of the film currently in theaters with a brand new PG-13 version. Starting next Friday, this teen-friendly version of the film will play in approximately 1,000 theaters nationwide. This is the first time a film has been released in theaters with a new rating since 1978&#8217;s &#8220;Saturday Night Fever,&#8221; although in the case of that film, the new PG version (downgraded from R) was released in theaters months later. In the case of &#8220;The King&#8217;s Speech,&#8221; which is still playing in wide release, the studio is simply pulling the current R-rated version from theaters and replacing all prints with this new PG-13 version. The Motion Picture Association of America, which is responsible for designating the ratings of films, originally gave &#8220;The King&#8217;s Speech&#8221; an R rating for &#8220;some language.&#8221; The reedited PG-13 version is so rated because of &#8220;language.&#8221; In the PG-13 cut, numerous uses of the &#8220;F-bomb&#8221; have either been muted or replaced with &#8220;s*it.&#8221;<span id="more-970"></span></p>
<p>In late February, MPAA chair Bob Pisnano and NATO (National Association of Theater Owners) president John Fithian co-signed a waiver permitting the Weinstein Co. to release this new version <em>without</em> the standard provision that it be released 90 days after the R-rated version was pulled from theaters. Prior to a few years ago, the possibility of this waiver did not exist, so &#8220;The King&#8217;s Speech&#8221; is the first time the waiver has been employed by a film studio. It seems clear the Weinstein Co. has made the effort to release a PG-13 version of the film in hopes of attracting more widespread revenue. An R rating limits film patrons under the age of 17 to only being sold a ticket when in the presence of a parent or guardian. With a PG-13 rating, however, no age limit exists in terms of ticket sales.</p>
<p>This re-rating seems to indicate the tremendous power role that the studio holds. It seems that, at least in this particular case, the studio is more interested in obtaining as much profit as possible rather than the film&#8217;s art. Not only did &#8220;The King&#8217;s Speech&#8221; receive extensive critical acclaim and win the Best Picture Oscar in its original form, but it also was very successful financially (the film has grossed $132.7 million in the United States already). From a logical standpoint, there seems to be no reason for the existence of the PG-13 version. The subject matter of &#8220;The King&#8217;s Speech&#8221; is inherently adult and, at least on first glance, it doesn&#8217;t seem like allowing teenagers to see the film unaccompanied will really change the film&#8217;s fortunes a considerable amount. The DVD is also scheduled for release on April 19, less than three weeks after the PG-13 re-release, perhaps further muting box office returns. The Weinstein Co.&#8217;s actions could have extensive repercussions throughout the film industry. If the PG-13 re-release of the film is at all successful, it may give studios incentives to lobotomize the content of future films in order to gain more audience-friendly ratings. What&#8217;s more, this issue seems to be stirring a debate regarding the preservation of the film&#8217;s original content. The filmmakers of &#8220;The King&#8217;s Speech&#8221; intended for the film to be seen in its original R rating, and some have spoken out against changing the film&#8217;s content, such as the film&#8217;s star Geoffrey Rush. Our group believes this change in the film&#8217;s rating to be some  &#8220;bull&#8230;&#8221; Censorship should not stand, and filmmakers should be able to have their content embraced by audiences in the way dictated by the creators themselves, not the studios.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Powers, Lindsay. (2011, February 17). Redbox taking on netflix with new digital streaming movie service. <em>The Hollywood Reporter</em>.   Retrieved from <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/redbox-taking-netflix-new-digital-100543" target="_blank">http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/redbox-taking-netflix-new-digital-100543</a>.<a href="http://mediaindustries11.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/02/gamefly-redbox.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-843" src="http://mediaindustries11.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/02/gamefly-redbox-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a></p>
<p>In an era when media industries must constantly adapt to developing technologies and consumer desires, DVD rental company Redbox will soon be making technology-based improvements in an effort to compete with its rival Netflix. Redbox, known for its compact, bright red kiosks stationed by grocery store and gas station exits, works by vending DVDs to customers at a rate of $1 per day via credit card. According to Redbox president Mitch Lowe, the company will begin offering a subscription-based streaming Internet service by the end of this year. For a monthly fee, Redbox will soon offer on-demand movie access online in addition to continuing their kiosk services. Netflix, widely perceived as Redbox&#8217;s main competitor, currently draws in 20 million subscribers per year with its convenient online and mail delivery services. As media companies are often devising strategies to remain financially successful and keep up with their competitors, Redbox is hoping to expand its consumer base and cater to individuals who want an expedient service with the least amount of human communication possible.<span id="more-839"></span></p>
<p>With the recent successes of the Nook and the Kindle in the book industry, exhibitors in the motion picture/DVD industry have taken notice and are seeking a broader audience for their products. A relatively new company founded in 2003, Redbox currently does not have any registered customers in the way a company like Netflix does because of its lack of a subscription service. With the changes the company is making, however, Redbox will soon have customers who pay a monthly fee and are known to the company. As American consumers have become increasingly tech-savvy, the simple option of procuring a DVD from a kiosk may not suffice for either the company or the customers in the near future. <!--more--></p>
<p>As a trade-off for making its services more accessible to customers, it is likely that Redbox&#8217;s fees will increase for customers. This challenge represents a potential financial difficulty for the company. However, increasing surcharges at the expense of customer convenience is a common trend that can be found in an industry like the motion picture/DVD world. Redbox is gambling on the hope that customers will accept elevated costs for more convenience, especially as they are making the effort to compete with Netflix. By implementing changes that allow for online streaming and require customers to subscribe to its services, Redbox&#8217;s aim is no doubt to establish themselves as a dominant force in the industry.</p>
