								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve gotten the chance to speak with a number of Muhlenberg community members who saw the show &#8211; first years, faculty, and other students &#8211; all of whom were really invested in getting involved somehow. To you (and those of you who I haven&#8217;t gotten to talk to yet), good! That passion and hunger for equality is what keeps all of us going. I keep saying the same things to these people and I&#8217;ll say it here: Keep talking about it. Talk to your friends about these things, tell them to talk to their friends. Talk to your professors and to administrators and to the dining workers and the janitors and the religious leaders.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a concrete way to get involved, visit the Multicultural Center, email one of us, join an affinity group (even if you don&#8217;t necessarily belong to that group! You don&#8217;t have to be a minority to support a minority group). The Activities Fair is this Saturday, where a lot of those groups will make themselves known, so check that out!</p>
<p>Just because the play is over doesn&#8217;t mean that we&#8217;re finished. Keep talking and fighting for freedom.</p>
