								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ben did a great job giving a brief overview of what we&#8217;ve been working on and what&#8217;s to come in terms of SDP.  I want to go a little bit further in this post and talk a bit about why the Project is structured the way it is.</p>
<p>The Sedehi Diversity Project is a student-created, student-led piece of documentary theatre.  What that essentially means is that in addition to performing the piece, Ensemble members are involved in every aspect of it&#8217;s creation, from interviews to script building to blocking.  And even though I&#8217;m the director per say, there&#8217;s a more collective view of the process in which we work together to envision and produce this piece of theatre.</p>
<p>Documentary theatre is also inherently unique.  All of the material from our script is born out of things that were said by the Muhlenberg community.  Every single line.  How we acquire these perspectives is by going out and doing interviews (over 50 this year) and then transcribing them from audio to text (if you thought that sounds time consuming, it is haha).  This is so important because this script is completely personalized to Muhlenberg campus; it&#8217;s not just a generalized play about diversity.  It reflects the attitudes and climate of the campus community in the year that the play was produced.  Having been in the project last year, I can already sense the ways in which the tenor of this year&#8217;s play will be different.</p>
<p>So we interview and transcribe, interview and transcribe.  We are now at the point where we are taking all of that material and putting it in conversation with one another.  This involves going through well over a hundred pages of potential script.  Our goal, once again, is to reflect the conversations that are occurring on campus, right now.  This is not just another play about getting along in spite of our differences.  This becomes a discussion of real discourse about diversity, both the good and the bad.  It is a call to action.</p>
<p>Once our script is produced, we will move from the rehearsal house and into the black box, where the piece is performed, to become acquainted with the space.  As it is not required to be involved in theatre to be in this play, some Ensemble members really explored that space before.  With the exception of myself and our wonderful Project Manager Will, the Ensemble will become embodiments of our community, delivering the perspectives of many different community members, many different bodies.</p>
<p>SDP is one of the most exciting projects that I&#8217;ve ever been involved in, and one of the most unique.  I don&#8217;t want to speak for the entire Ensemble (so you guys correct me if I&#8217;m wrong haha), but it has already affected all of us, allowed us to express our own perspectives while also challenging certain ideas that we held.  We hope it will do the same for all those who come to see it.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: #000000">I cannot believe that we have officially completed a full week of rehearsal &#8212; just over that now.  Probably should get on this blog already haha.  The time has just flown so far and I cannot quite decide whether I want things to slow down to enjoy them more or to speed up because I know there are only more exciting things ahead.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">It&#8217;s interesting, having been in the Ensemble last year as well, how both similar and different that the group dynamic can be.  What is clearly the same to me is the passion with which everyone is invested in conversations surrounding diversity, regardless from the perspectives and experiences we are coming from.  In fact, it is often in those differences that we are able to reach deeper understandings and bond more as an Ensemble.  Even in the first couple of days, we were already staying up way past 2 am talking about these issues.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">That&#8217;s not to say, however, we haven&#8217;t had a ridiculous amount of goofy fun, from the question game to yofresh runs to manhunt to bonding with our teddy bears.  I&#8217;m already dreading move out because I don&#8217;t want to spend a second away from these guys.</span></p>
