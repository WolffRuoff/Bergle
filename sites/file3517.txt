Retrieved from <a href="http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/industry/legal-and-management/vice-president-joe-biden-calls-piracy-outright-1005136622.story">http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/industry/legal-and-management/vice-president-joe-biden-calls-piracy-outright-1005136622.story</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://images1.variety.com/graphics/photos/_storypics/biden_joe_piracy.jpg" alt="" width="175" height="117" />Stricter copyright laws may be looming, if comments by Vice President Joe Biden are any indication. In an <a href="http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/industry/legal-and-management/vice-president-joe-biden-calls-piracy-outright-1005136622.story">interview</a> with the Hollywood trade magazine <em><a href="http://www.variety.com/Home/">Variety</a></em>, he took a personal stand against piracy (both music and movies), calling it “outright theft.” Industry executives are hopeful that this strong language indicates that Washington is willing to push through new regulations on streaming and downloading despite other drastically more important issues that the White House and Congress should be tackling instead.</p>
<p><span id="more-1145"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to Billboard, Biden’s statements leave “little doubt about where the White House stands on piracy.” This is ridiculous, of course. One of the cardinal rules of politics is to leave a little bit of doubt about your position on everything to avoid those embarrassing “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read_my_lips:_no_new_taxes">read my lips, no new taxes</a>” moments. Biden does this, clumsily, by hinting that the entertainment industry isn’t devoting enough resources to educating the public about piracy. Recording industry executives, however, salivate every time someone in the authority role publicly takes their side. This is because industry people fully understand how important the authority power role is to their business.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s no secret that the recording industry spends more time suing consumers in court than actually producing decent music for those consumers to buy (or steal). And the industry’s success in the courtroom depends crucially on their lobbying success in Washington. Biden’s interview with <em>Variety</em> comes at a time when the White House is busy <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/ip_white_paper.pdf">drafting revisions to U.S. copyright law</a> that will strongly favor the recording industry. First on the block: unauthorized music streaming, the mainstay of facilitators like <a href="http://listen.grooveshark.com">Grooveshark</a>, which the new rules may officially prohibit for the first time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Producers within the recording industry have argued for stricter downloading and streaming rules for years. The industry’s main facilitator, the <a href="http://riaa.org/physicalpiracy.php">RIAA</a>, plasters its website with the <a href="http://riaa.org/physicalpiracy.php">scary numbers behind piracy</a>: $12.5 billion in lost revenue every year, $2.7 billion in lost worker earnings, and 71,060 lost jobs. The money the labels make from sucking their own “artists” dry through exploitative contracts may help lessen this impact, especially if they start passing some of their ill-gotten earnings from their major executives’ pockets to their “workers.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ironically, the ones really feeling the kick of illegal downloading are the exhibitors. The operators of Borders, Barnes and Noble, and Wal-Mart stores are the ones whose pockets you’re actually stealing from when you download <a href="http://rebeccablackonline.com/">Rebecca Black</a>’s new album from Pirate Bay instead of purchasing it. Whether or not the record companies will start sharing any new revenue generated from increased enforcement of copyright laws with artists and exhibitors remains to be seen, but it’s highly unlikely.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ultimately, the recording industry will probably pressure Washington into passing stricter copyright rules. The bulk of the politicians’ electorate—old people—couldn’t care less about music downloading laws, and the people most affected by it—Generation Y—are generally politically disengaged and/or powerless. In a time when arguments about funding for Social Security and international wars are threatening to shut down the government, a new copyright law is an easy pass, and this one will probably slip through Congress unnoticed. The impact it will have on each person’s individual music experience, however, is still uncertain.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Peoples, G. (29 March 2011). Amazon beats Apple and Google to the cloud. <em>Billboard</em>. Retrieved from <a href="http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/industry/digital-and-mobile/amazon-beats-apple-and-google-to-the-cloud-1005098372.story">http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/industry/digital-and-mobile/amazon-beats-apple-and-google-to-the-cloud-1005098372.story</a></p>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://cdn.pocket-lint.com/images/zYQm/amazon-cloud-drive-streams-in-1.jpg?20110329-123718" alt="" width="221" height="137" />The last decade has witnessed fierce competition between media companies whose products were initially quite different. <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a>, that little search engine that could in the nineties, today locks horns with <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> in the Internet TV and music exhibition market. Now <a href="http://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a>, that erstwhile book distributor, has announced that it, too, is joining the digital music fray. In a move that will <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/apr/03/john-naughton-amazon-cloud-drive-google-sony">light a fire under product developers</a> at Apple and Google, Amazon announced the debut of its new digital music service <a href="https://www.amazon.com/clouddrive/learnmore/ref=sa_menu_acd_lrn2">Cloud Drive</a>, which allows users to share their own music across computers through the Internet (the “cloud”). And, true to form, the recording companies are already finding reasons to go berserk about it.</p>
<p><span id="more-1024"></span></p>
<p>Amazon, of course, has been both exhibiting and distributing music for years. The new service will make Amazon a facilitator, as well. Users will be able to create an Amazon account, upload existing music files or buy MP3s right from Amazon, and access that music on any Internet-capable computer. By facilitating users’ storage of existing MP3s, Amazon obviously hopes to draw more users into its own MP3 store in an imitation of Apple’s<a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/"> iTunes</a> success. The company even offers discounts on storage space based on the number of MP3s the user buys directly from Amazon. And why shouldn’t they buy? One digital copy of a song is about the same as any other, and Amazon’s MP3s can live on the Internet instead of just one computer. All the people who lost their entire iTunes library when attempting to transfer it from one computer to another should take note.</p>
<p>It looks like Amazon may actually make some money off of this. And wherever you find an outside company profiting from a music service, you find the <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-31001_3-20048499-261.html">major record labels preparing to sue them</a>. The exact details of the labels’ problem with the service are a bit sketchy, but the main concern is a new form of P2P file sharing. Cloud Drive technically only allows users to share music with themselves on different digital platforms, but if one user uploads thousands of songs and then starts selling their Cloud Drive password for $50 a pop, a nightmare could ensue for the recording industry.</p>
<p>The record labels, possibly weary of dragging all of the world’s 7 billion people through the U.S. legal system, have indicated that they’re willing to drop the issue if Amazon re-buys the licenses for the songs they distribute through Cloud Drive, thereby reducing the financial impact of possible mass file sharing. So far, Amazon has adamantly refused. They claim that they are simply providing users with an online external hard drive. The recording companies have pointed out that it’s much easier to share music online than through a physical hard drive, but Amazon argues that the two are legally the same.</p>
<p>In addition to the labels’ lust for making users pay every time two notes of a song hit their ears, Amazon must also find ways to compete with Google and Apple, who are already calling Cloud Drive an inferior product. Google’s upcoming digital music service has hit legal challenges from the labels before it even debuted, but Google claims it’s working through the challenges while developing features for users that will easily out-compete Cloud Drive, including easy ways to store video and photos as well as music. Amazon, for its part, is basking in the glow of both upstaging the record labels and being the first in the new market.</p>
<p>Only time will tell whether all digital content—music, video, etc.—will migrate to the cloud during the next few years, but with almost all the major technology companies developing cloud-driven products, it certainly seems likely. The recording companies may need to be dragged, kicking and screaming, into this future. Now that other companies are finding ways to let users expand their digital music options, the labels will have to continue finding ways to continue profiting from their products. That is the industry’s current challenge.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bruno, A. (16 March 2011). MTV launches Hive website, latest effort to refocus on music. <em>Billboard</em>. Retrieved from <a href="http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/industry/digital-and-mobile/mtv-launches-hive-website-latest-effort-1005075732.story#">http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/industry/digital-and-mobile/mtv-launches-hive-website-latest-effort-1005075732.story#</a></p>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/photos/stylus/1037809-MTV-Hive.png" alt="" width="200" height="140" />The empty acronym formerly known as Music Television (MTV) debuted a new website this week that focuses on…music. The new site, called “<a href="http://www.mtvhive.com/">Hive</a>,” will feature music videos, interviews, book reviews by artists, polls, music popularity tracking meters, and editorials by the company’s top executives. It appears to represent an effort by MTV to reinvent its image after recent Reality- show scandals, including a child pornography investigation surrounding its shock-schlock show <em>Skins</em>.</p>
<p><span id="more-955"></span></p>
<p>MTV wasn’t always a Reality TV depot. At its peak, MTV was one of the most important exhibitors in the music industry. Eighties and nineties kids often heard new music for the first time on the network’s popular request shows, and MTV’s decision to promote or marginalize a new artist could make or break a recording company’s profits for an entire year. The network also transformed the music video into a form of mass media, forcing the labels to dump millions of dollars a year into producing high-quality and catchy videos for audiences.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, over a decade after jumping onto the Reality TV bandwagon, MTV apparently wants to recapture some of its former image (and power). The network will exhibit music on the site, with a section for users to access new and vintage music videos and buy MP3s. Alongside the actual music will be polls that track users’ opinions of new artists, videos that feature <a href="http://www.mtvhive.com/playlists/76BA27020227BA7600010227BA76/mgid:playlist:video:mtvmusic.com:71585">sometimes bizarre</a> consumer reviews of music videos, and a feature called <a href="http://www.mtvmusicmeter.com/">Music Meter</a>, which claims to track an artists’ popularity on social media and downloading sites. MTV’s many Top Ten countdowns and on-air VJ reviews made it a facilitator for the music industry since its inception, and network executives are clearly hoping to carry that role online. To help with the transition, the network is bringing in veteran music industry linking pin Jessica Robertson, who helped <em><a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/">Rolling Stone</a> </em>and <em><a href="http://www.spinner.com/">Spinner</a></em> digitize and re-format their content for the Internet age.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In some ways, it’s surprising that MTV waited so long to overhaul its website. This is the network that has exploited almost every synergistic media connection possible, from television series to a movie division. Now that MTV is finally ready to “flex some music muscles,” as network president Van Toffler says, it may already be too late. MTV’s core demographic, the teen to twenties group, has been getting MP3s and music news online from sources that look suspiciously like MTV’s new website, including <a href="http://www.billboard.com/#/">Billboard</a>, for over a decade. Hive will have to include some outstanding features to draw users away from their established online music outlets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One notable feature of the site is the complete lack of traditional “advertising.” Of course, that’s largely because the site is one big advertisement for all artists whose labels have made deals with MTV to sell merchandise, concert tickets, and MP3s on the site, along with other promotion deals. In fact, the same criticisms that the network faced at its peak are likely to carry over to the new website. For years, critics argued that MTV was the prime homogenization force in the music industry, squeezing out smaller artists whose indie labels couldn’t pay to make high-profile deals with the network. It’s not hard to imagine that any concert tickets or merchandise sold on Hive won’t be for your local neighborhood ska band’s next gig. It’s not really that MTV doesn’t like indie artists. MTV has a bottom line to worry about, and music and promotion deals with Sony and EMI are more likely to increase it than smaller labels.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, it’s not really MTV doing all these things at all. MTV is actually owned by <a href="http://www.viacom.com/Pages/default.aspx">Viacom</a>, a massive media conglomerate that owns a number of television channels (including Nickelodeon) and a diversified portfolio of other media holdings. Viacom is interested in promoting the same content across multiple channels and making deals with reliable companies who they know will follow through on their commitments. Large national corporations don’t necessarily have time to deal with the eccentric smaller indie labels. MTV probably initially jumped into bed with Viacom because it couldn’t afford to do that, either. Like most things, it all comes down to money.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MTV apparently hopes to offer more local music listings and services in the future, but there’s no trace of those features on Hive. As the Internet becomes the primary exhibition and distribution outlet for music, corporations like MTV that specialize in music may eventually have to “own the local” in much the same way newspapers and radio stations had to with the advent of television. It’s too early to tell whether Hive will allow MTV to re-enter some of its former power roles in the music industry. Given Viacom’s financial backing, however, the network certainly has a fighting chance.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://iphoneroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/itunes_24bit_music.jpg" alt="" width="195" height="134" />Antony, B. (22 February 2011). Interscope&#8217;s Jimmy Iovine fighting the 24-bit fight. <em>Billboard</em>. Retrieved from <a href="http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/industry/digital-and-mobile/interscope-s-jimmy-iovine-fighting-the-24-1005044072.story#">http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/industry/digital-and-mobile/interscope-s-jimmy-iovine-fighting-the-24-1005044072.story#</a></p>
<p>Forget CDs! The real format war in the recording industry is between 16-bit and 24-bit audio files, and some industry executives are taking the 24-bit side. Interscope CEO Jimmy Iovine and Columbia Records Co-President Rick Rubin are pressuring other labels to start releasing audio files to iTunes in the higher-quality 24-bit format, ostensibly in an effort to improve the user’s experience. Unfortunately for users, the price of the new format may increase along with the quality.</p>
<p><span id="more-921"></span></p>
<p>But which users will buy these new 24-bit files? In a world where CDs still form the bulk of the industry’s profits, it seems silly for industry executives to promote an upgrade from an iTunes file format that nobody’s complaining about. However, it’s not the first format upgrade the industry’s initiated. In fact, the industry aggressively promoted CDs back in the late eighties and ended up with a years-long boom in profits as everyone switched to the new format. Maybe industry executives are hoping to mirror their success with CDs by promoting another “higher-quality” format for which they can charge more.</p>
<p>The future of this plan, however, hinges on Iovine and Rubin’s success in recruiting other industry executives to their side. As producers, both executives worry about their companies’ future profitability, and history shows that every media company promoting its own personal format isn’t conducive to higher profits for anyone. Both surely remember the <a href="http://www.mediacollege.com/video/format/compare/betamax-vhs.html">disastrous VHS-Beta war of the eighties</a>. The industry’s continued existence may rely on multiple producers banding together under one format.</p>
<p>It’s also possible that, after alienating the bulk of their digital fan base with <a href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2008/09/proving-file-sh/">frivolous file-sharing lawsuits</a>, record industry executives like Iovine and Rubin are eager to prove that they’re still on the users’ side. What better way to do this than to don the public advocate hat and pretend that what’s good for the record industry is what’s good for America? After all, the higher-quality music may enrich users’ overall experience—and would probably sound <em>great</em> under some of Iovine’s <a href="http://www.beatsbydre.com/">“Beats by Dre” line headphones</a>!</p>
<p>The real linchpin in this scheme is, of course, <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/">Apple</a>. Industry executives can release music in any format they want, but Apple’s software and devices need to play them. As music distribution and exhibition responsibilities pass from “one-stops” to iTunes, Apple’s cooperation becomes a crucial component of any business strategy in the music industry. Iovine is working with Apple and says they’ve been “great,” which must be the new euphemism for “greedy.” Everyone who understands Apple knows they won’t agree to reconfigure their software and devices to run a new, higher-priced format without reconfiguring the way they manage profits from sales of that new, higher-priced music. Financial details are sketchy, but with industry executives and Apple executives (is there a difference anymore?) on either end of the bargaining table, the negotiations should be intense.</p>
<p>The real issue, however, revolves around whether music fans care more about quality of music or convenience of access. Another executive at Sony pointed out that users historically care more about convenience. And as every Internet user knows, accessing music online has never been more convenient. If a new 24-bit format became standard right now, it’s likely that the only major change would be more 24-bit files on <a href="http://thepiratebay.org/">Pirate Bay</a>.</p>
<p>Maybe industry executives should focus on getting people to pay for the existing 16-bit format before promoting new digital formats.</p>
