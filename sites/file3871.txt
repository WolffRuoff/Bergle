								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Patel, K. (April 4, 2011). Networks, Exchanges Are Not Immune to Groupon-Cloning Fad. <em>Advertising Age.</em> Retrieved from <a href="http://adage.com/article/special-report-audience-buying-guide/networks-exchanges-immune-groupon-cloning-fad/149656/">http://adage.com/article/special-report-audience-buying-guide/networks-exchanges-immune-groupon-cloning-fad/149656/</a></p>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://www.welovedc.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/groupon.png" alt="" width="400" height="155" /> Groupon uses the power of the traditional “group discount,” and economies of scale, to save individuals money. When a certain number of people opt-in, they all benefit from the discount. One may consider Groupon the improved digital incarnate of coupon circulars, socialized to create better deals. This has attracted the attention of the newspaper industry, as newspaper titans such as Hearst and New York Times have contracted with smaller distributors in the emerging “deals market,” or exchanges, such Analog Analytics. For example:</p>
<div><span id="more-1050"></span></div>
<div>
<blockquote><p>On Analog, a publisher like the Register, which sells the deal, gets 15% of all deals sold on any site; the publisher that distributes the deal &#8212; LA News, in this case &#8212; gets 20% and Analog gets 15% for brokering. (The merchant, per the usual Groupon model, gets the 	remaining 50%.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Deals networks such as ReachLocal and Tippr easily entered the deals market, breaking the traditional high barriers to entry that existed with printed circular coupons. While Groupon and LivingSocial are dominate players in the deals market, power is less concentrated because of the ease at which new locally focused exhibitors can enter the market. For example, Facebook is working with ReachLocal to target audiences in San Deigo, while using Tippr, Gilt City, OpenTable and PopSugar City to target markets in other cities.</p>
<p>The power roles frame classifies these Internet group coupon companies as an exhibitors and producers. Smaller companies occupy the exhibitor role, choosing to give up a certain percent of profit to brokers such as Analog Analytics (who produce the deals).  This allows for smaller exhibitors to compete with the major players in the industry. Without the help of deals suppliers such as Adility, who have built up relationships with local merchants over the years with printed coupons, these larger companies would have near complete control the industry.</p>

(March 22, 2011). P&amp;G, Best Buy, Google, EA, Twitter Headline Ad Age&#8217;s Digital Conference April 6-7. Retrieved March 25, 2011 from <a href="http://adage.com/article/digital/p-g-google-ea-headline-ad-age-digital-conference-april-6-7/149513/">http://adage.com/article/digital/p-g-google-ea-headline-ad-age-digital-conference-april-6-7/149513/</a></p>
<p>On April 6th &amp; 7th, AdAge will facilitate the fifth annual Digital Conference, “where marketers, publishers, agency executives, digital strategists, creative technologists and Internet entrepreneurs will share their visions for the digital and emerging media landscape, along with their stories of what&#8217;s working and what&#8217;s not.” This year’s conference headlines the burgeoning relationship between the video-gaming industry, online social media services and mobile platforms.<br />
<span id="more-976"></span><br />
Social Media platforms have found many new and innovative ways to generate profits. Twitter’s Promoted Tweets platform that currently allow major advertisers to get their ‘160 Characters of Fame’ when their tweets show up on users twitter feeds.  At the conference, Twitter’s President of Global Revenues will show the monetization structure of the platform and discuss future paid advertising opportunities.</p>
<p>Another important up-and-coming industry that will be discussed at the conference is the new social shopping and group-buying companies like Groupon and Living Social. These companies act as distributors and exhibitors for either local or national companies to push out deals to consumers who can get discounts if their is a certain predetermined number of users who express interest opt in.</p>
<p>Consumer demand has shifted industry focus from a console-game model to a multi-platform model utilizing the Internet (with services such as Xbox Live and the PlayStation Network). The shift has developed new revenue sources while creating an experience driven by social interaction. Revenue models have expanded to include more transactions after the initial purchasing of the game, making the experience more engaging and longer lasting. The shift dilutes the distribution power of traditional game-consoles, as new platforms emerge as distribution channels for video-gaming.</p>
<p>Additionally, social platforms, especially Facebook, have seen great profits from the implementation of their gaming platform.  Games Like Mafia Wars, the Oregon Trail, and Farmville, have built up major followings, and only allow users a limited number of moves within a set time period, which can be extended if users are willing to pay, which surprisingly a great number of people are. Here, we see the shifting creator and producer power roles, as small application developers can create a prolific number of new applications at low cost, a parallel to the traditional economic boom/bust model in media industries.</p></div>
