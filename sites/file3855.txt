Eminem to star in Super Bowl claymation ad: Report.  <em>Billboard</em>.  Retrieved from <a href="http://www.billboard.com/search/?keyword=eminem#/news/eminem-to-star-in-super-bowl-claymation-1005016312.story">http://www.billboard.com/search/?keyword=eminem#/news/eminem-to-star-in-super-bowl-claymation-1005016312.story</a></p>

<p>Lipton Brisk Iced Tea has a treat for Super Bowl ad enthusiasts this year: Eminem in Claymation! The rapper allegedly landed an appearance in Lipton’s $1 million ad spot, set to air during the February 6th game, which features a clay version of him going through “a day in the life” of a superstar. The Claymation theme harks back to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-g8opm1ZmY&amp;playnext=1&amp;list=PL3AEE3D248A17A481">a classic Lipton ad campaign that once featured Frank Sinatra</a>.</p>
<p><span id="more-719"></span></p>
<p>Eminem’s participation in the ad reveals the continuing attempts at synergy between the sound recording industry and the television advertising departments of major companies like Lipton. It especially represents the sound recording industry’s attempt to nab its own piece of the Super Bowl revenue pie. Advertisers realized long ago that the Super Bowl’s ability to reach multiple demographics—a rare ability indeed in this era of fragmented cable audiences—makes the mega-million-dollar ad spaces worth the price. The sound recording industry, in turn, can exploit the advertisers’ need for celebrity endorsements to give their ads that extra pizazz. Clay Eminem drinks some clay tea for Lipton and Lipton gets Eminem (and his new album) in front of the 18-34 audience. Everyone wins. This has been going on since (and long before) <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8qtsUaoVak&amp;feature=related">Madonna teamed up with Pepsi during the 1980s to release her “Like a Prayer” video</a>. The fact that everyone remembers that ad testifies to the strategy’s potential.</p>
<p>Lurking somewhere behind all these joint sound recording-television ventures is a person or persons who are serving what Turow would call “linking pin” roles. These are the people who try to “link” someone or something from one medium (in this case, sound recording) to another (in this case, television). Since Eminem owns his own record label, he’s almost certainly in full promo mode for his new album, <em>Relapse</em>, through traditional sound recording channels like radio and new ones like iTunes. However, the Super Bowl ad offers a vastly expanded audience and possibly access to new TV-watching fans. In the new Information Age, artists who <em>don’t</em> venture into media outside of their industries are already behind.</p>
<p>Indeed, Eminem’s “linking pins” (which may include himself) have been hard at work even outside of preparing a Super Bowl ad appearance. In addition to television, he’s apparently eying a film role in an upcoming DreamWorks picture.</p>
<p>Why all this branching out in the music industry? While recording artists are no strangers to working within the television and film worlds, some of the recent expansion into other media may reflect concerns about illegal downloading. New file sharing outfits seem to pop up faster than the record labels can file lawsuits against them. The possibility of decreasing profit potential within the traditional sound recording industry may motivate artists like Eminem to explore work in other media industries and to seek new advertising opportunities.</p>
<p>Only time will tell how successful these explorations will be for the future of the sound recording industry.</p>
