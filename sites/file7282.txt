								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The amount of people that are gaining access to the internet and smart technology is increasing every day. According to a recent study conducted in seven different European countries (Belgium, Denmark, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Romania and the United Kingdom), many more children aged 9-16 are obtaining these technologies (Mascheroni &amp; Ólafsson, 2016). There has been less attention to this issue than issues such as inequalities in technology (Mascheroni &amp; Ólafsson, 2016).  According to another study “People who have more Internet access points are more likely to possess higher levels of online skill and have more opportunities to explore a wide range of mobile phone features” (Mascheroni &amp; Ólafsson, 2016). The usage patterns suggest that those better connected had a better chance to climb the ladder of opportunities which would make them better candidates for jobs (Mascheroni &amp; Ólafsson, 2016). When the data for each country was compared to the others, the variations were linked to the different levels of adoption and use of smartphones in each country (Mascheroni &amp; Ólafsson, 2016). This was tested to show that the increase in children with smartphones directly impacted the ability to get jobs. They compared gender, age, smartphone ownership and daily use, child’s experience with the internet and parental ownership and use of a mobile device so that all variables were accounted for (Mascheroni &amp; Ólafsson, 2016). The results indicated that kids were more likely to own a cellphone in certain countries and those who do had a higher likelihood of using it for the internet (Mascheroni &amp; Ólafsson, 2016). Another result found was that those of higher socioeconomic status were “69% less likely to use social media” (Mascheroni &amp; Ólafsson, 2016). This is odd because in America, it’s usually the opposite with wealthy people using more social media than those with less wealth.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span lang="EN-US">In today’s internet community, not only famous people, but also normal people can be seen by the public through search engines or some social media. And the thing we should do first in this open community is to try to know what other people see through my social media accounts. So I use an afternoon to pretend I am a stranger and searching information through Google to try to know a person named JiahuiHuang. First of all, I entered the name JiahuiHuang in the Google engine to see if something shows. But the result really disappointed me, no matter if I click on ALL, Images, or Videos, the only place I can find myself is the LinkedIn—I am the eighteenth in line. To have a more accurate result, I also tried to search my information from other search engines like Bing and DuckDuckGo, though the messages they showed are different, I can’t find more information about myself. I started to think if my mother tongue is not English, and I stayed in a country that speak Chinese in my past eighteen years that would influence the result. So I searched my information in Google again, but this time in Chinese. Again, I found nothing, because so many people in China are named JiahuiHuang and I am not famous. Then I added some key words during the searching like my primary school. Excellent, I finally found a few things about myself during this searching—some writings that were awarded and some other award certificates at my primary school, and no more can be found.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Why do I have so little information in the internet? Few reasons</span><span lang="EN-US">: </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">1. I am not famous</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">2. I am not a person who is outstanding—famous in a particular field, won some special award or had some special achievements.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">3. I am kind of a person that out of the online social community, I post nothing and sometimes I use a pseudonym in some social media such as Facebook and Instagram.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Is it a great thing that others will have a hard time to find my real information through the network? From a security and privacy perspective, yes! But in my heart, I will feel uncomfortable that others can’t find something about me, because this proves I am not an outstanding person. In the future, though I will still not post something about myself, I hope others can find more about me through searching in Google. And what I hope to be seen in the future network in five years is something like this: JiahuiHuang, an outstanding student who used to study in Muhlenberg; Stanford student, JiahuiHuang, assists the professor in the important study of a subject; JiahuiHuang, reports an essay in a scientific magazine… </span></p>

Interestingly, each time I did it was it was with the expectation of hoping to see some stats about a sporting event I recently played in. I expected to read about my sports accomplishments.<span id="yiv2340228953yui_3_16_0_1_1476194798227_2670">  </span>Candidly speaking, I was focused on simply being mentioned since with each published stat my popularity rose amongst my peers and in sports circles.<span id="yiv2340228953yui_3_16_0_1_1476194798227_2671">  </span>With each new sporting event came more name recognition, photos and videos. In all candor, I never really paid much attention to the details. <span id="yiv2340228953yui_3_16_0_1_1476194798227_2672"> </span>Instead, my focus was seeing my stats in print for all to see and the sport’s action photos that usually accompanied the posts.<span id="yiv2340228953yui_3_16_0_1_1476194798227_2673">  </span>I didn’t expect to find anything else—sports is who I am.</div>

<div id="yiv2340228953yui_3_16_0_1_1476194798227_2677">This project reinforced what I already knew—most of what is posted about me revolves around sports. Admittedly, each new post helped fuel my self-confidence, motivation and competitive edge. The posts provided positive reinforcement for me and I sough them out. Yes, there was a site here or there that talked about other things such as scholarships received or community projects but for the most part is was all about sports. <span id="yiv2340228953yui_3_16_0_1_1476194798227_2678"> </span>I have managed to keep my private live just that –private&#8211;and I hope to keep it that way. Naturally, there would be exceptions for certain milestones and events that could help me achieve certain goals or are worthy of sharing because of the positive values they evoke and inspire. <span id="yiv2340228953yui_3_16_0_1_1476194798227_2679"> </span></div>

Recognition for community service projects, work accomplishments and promotions, travel experiences and positive news about my development as a person is what I hope they read about me</span></div>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Did they have computers when you were younger, or were they still using feathers and ink?” While I do not remember my 5 year-old self asking this question, my mother and siblings will not let me live it down. A world without technology seems like a lifetime ago; a lifetime I have never experienced.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">            For as long as I can remember, I have lived in a tech world. From the time I wake up in the morning, until the time I go to bed, I am constantly utilizing technology. “Teens ages 13 to 17 are also going online frequently. Aided by the convenience and constant access provided by mobile, 92% of teens report going online daily – with 24% using the internet “almost constantly,” 56% going online several times a day and 12% reporting once-a-day use” (Lenhart). In the matter of seconds the world is at my fingertips connecting me to everyone and everything I could ever imagine plus more. My life, for all intent and purposes, revolves around technology. From my smartphone to my laptop and wireless printer, my video games to my tablet I spend a majority of my life and waking hours using some form of technology.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">            My experience with technology began at a very young age. At the mere age of 4 I was enrolled in a computer class. While the class did not go into depth about computers and all that could be done with these devices, it did expose me to a world that would become commonplace later in life. As I grew I graduated from computer games, to Nintendo Gameboys to PSPs and currently Xbox One it allowed me to take my gaming mobile. Everywhere I went my device came with me. I never thought twice about it, and it seemed like I was not the only one. Everywhere I went I was surrounded by others enamored with (not to mention glued to) their devices&#8211; parents on their cell phones, children on Gameboys, employees on their computers. Technology was all around me and as I grew it only surrounded me more, tightening its grasp and allure.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">            As I matured so did my relationship with technology. With each new technological advancement my world grew larger, my reach became broader and the endless possibilities available to me became more abundant. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">            My family went from a household with a communal phone attached to the wall and a single desktop computer that would require us to plug into the phone line, leaving the phone incapacitated during use to laptops and smartphones connected over Wi-Fi for all and tremendous independence. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> With age I have begun to better appreciate all the benefits the ever expanding world of technology offers me. Devices such as GoogleDocs has been incredibly beneficial to me in my studies throughout high school and now in college. In many of my classes over the years I noticed an increased focus on group projects being assigned to me by my teachers which posed a challenge to me. Being the 3 sport athlete that I was throughout high school, it was not always easy finding time to meet up with my other group members to work on our assignment together. To make things easier on everyone we typically did work through GoogleDocs so that we could collaboratively work on our different parts of the project when time allowed while also enabling us to help and critique other members of the group through GroupMe. The ease of accessibility for everyone enabled more work to get done while not wasting other group members because I could not physically be there to work on the assignment with them. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Frankly, I cannot imagine a world without technology. A failure to maintain a keen knowledge of all forms of technology will undoubtedly present challenges and a loss of opportunities in almost all aspects of my life. I don’t<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>intend to pass those opportunities by.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A day in the life of the internet by Michael Keshen describes how the ordinary computer user uses technology today. The enormity of the hold that the internet has on our lives is incredible. The internet allows for people to be in constant contact with larger audiences. To put this into perspective the article A Day in the Life of the Internet by Mike Keshen provides an interesting statistic<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>of one hundred million people logging into twitter daily (Keshen, 2014). One hundred and forty characters of tweeted information can potentially reach one hundred million people a day. The article also stresses the importance of how the internet is becoming more convenient with $717,808,219 dollars spent on online purchases (Keshen, 2014). </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Information is at our fingertips virtually any moment that we need it. Proof of this concept was exemplified in the previously stated statistic of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>how many people actually use the internet.We rely on the information given to us because it is easy and convenient to access. This is represented even in our class time. With a click of a button Zoltero can immediately cite a article for a paper. I find this extremely innovative because it really shows how far we have progressed in technology. To reemphasize this point it is important to look back to see how far we have grown technologically. “Two centuries ago Leibnitz invented a calculating machine which embodied most of the essential features of recent keyboard devices, but it could not then come into use. The economics of the situation were against it: the labor involved in constructing it, before the days of mass production, exceeded the labor to be saved by its use, since all it could accomplish could be duplicated by sufficient use of pencil and paper” (Bush,1945). It is truly incredible feat to see how far technology has come since the pen and paper. Also we can see differences in our priorities because in the olden days the cost was too astronomical to see a potential in technology. Now we are constantly advancing technology and spending all of our time and resources on it. </span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The info graph <em>A Day In The Life Of The Internet  </em>by Michael Keshan, portrays many facts and knowledge of the internet and its usage  throughout the world. Billions of people use the internet every day for one reason or another, whether its shopping, sending emails or even as a leisure activity. Over 144 billion emails are sent each day, 89 billion which are business related, over 5.9 billion searches happen a day and over 717 million dollars are spent a day on online shopping. All of these aspects of the internet most definitely improve daily life as it is a faster means of achieving something. I know from experience how the internet can make your life easier. When I am studying for my exams or doing homework and I do not know the answer to something, the internet gives me a easy  and quick way to find the answer to my problem. That being said, not everyone across the world has access to the internet. Only 63 percent of people in Europe have internet access, only 42 percent of people in South America and only 27 percent in Asia. Is that to say that all of those people without access have worse lives than those with access. There is no doubt having the internet comes with its advantages, however those without it might not think its an essential part to a good life.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I wake up in the morning, I roll over and grab my phone to instantly check my messages, emails, or social media. The internet has become a part of my everyday life, and I normally think of the internet as a positive thing; I can connect with my family and high school friends from a different state. However, many people fail to notice the negative aspect of technology and the impacts it will have on us in the future. Michael Keshen’s infographic highlights statistics about online activity and social media sites in a seemingly positive way, since the graphics are brightly colored and his word choice is appealing to a younger demographic. On YouTube, CGP Grey created a video entitled “Humans Need Not Apply,” discussing the inevitable “bot” (robot) takeover of human jobs (CGP Grey, 2014). There are bots mentioned in the video that have the ability to learn, which is frightening because this means that bots may become more capable than humans. In the future, it will become more cost effective for companies to use bots as opposed to human labor. For example, the online economy is only in its early stages, yet $717,808,219 is spent online everyday and over 100 million apps are downloaded (Keshen, 2014). These numbers are only expected to grow as technology becomes more efficient. However, the rest of our economy will be taken over by bots, leaving much of the population unemployed. What happens once humans start losing their jobs to bots? What will we have left to work towards?</p>
