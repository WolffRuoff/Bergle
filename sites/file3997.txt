								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bruno, A. (12 April 2011). New Grammy rules (finally) acknowledge videogame music. <em>Billboard</em>.

<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://echoesblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/grammy-logo-gold.jpg" alt="" width="140" height="178" />In a long-overdue decision, the <a href="http://www.grammy.org/recording-academy">Recording Academy</a> recently announced that it would consider video game music for <a href="http://www.grammy.com/">Grammy Awards</a>. Although video games won’t have their own category (yet), they’ll be included in a general category encompassing “Music for Visual Media.” Nobody in the general public cares about this, of course, but the interesting question is whether they should.</p>
<p><span id="more-1109"></span></p>
<p>It’s tempting to compare the Grammy Awards to MTV—sad stories of once-powerful facilitators that got an ear-boxing from cable and the Internet—but the power of the Grammy Awards to effectively promote music even during the network era is questionable. The event has always been a self-congratulatory party for an inside group of music industry people, and during a time when media choices were more limited, the public mainly just enjoyed basking in the pomp and circumstance of the networks’ glitzy coverage. In fact, a better analogy for the Grammys would be to an Independence Day parade, a once-family friendly event today attended mostly by old war vets as the younger crowd plugs into yet another interactive media platform.</p>
<p>The reality, however, is that the Grammy Awards aren&#8217;t really trying to facilitate interaction with that increasingly disinterested TV-viewing public. It’s aimed at those industry insiders, and that’s what makes the inclusion of video game music into the award categories so important. The Recording Academy may not have much direct power over audiences, but by facilitating interactions between industry creators and producers, it helps to determine what those audiences eventually hear online, in stores, and on the radio. Now it may help to determine what video gamers, probably the least likely subgroup of Americans to care about the Grammys, hear when they log into <em><a href="http://us.battle.net/wow/en/">World of Warcraft</a></em>.</p>
<p>The new rules formalize linking pin activities between the record companies and the video game industry that have been growing with the video game industry itself. Popular titles like <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> routinely license popular rock and heavy-metal songs that fit well within their violent and iconoclastic gaming environment. Now, as new game consoles like Wii <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/tech/gaming/2007-05-24-wii_N.htm">offer games for a wide variety of audience categories</a>—fitness games for kids and older adults, chess games for math prodigies—that expand video games far beyond their traditional teenage-male cult, the record companies are starting to work with the gaming companies to exploit all the new distribution and exhibition possibilities.</p>
<p>Why wouldn’t Sony, for example, create music just for a new video game aimed at a particular age group or gender? These days, online and console games probably have a larger audience than MTV or VH1, and they have the ability to reach at least as specialized an audience as a cable television network. Cross-platform releases that include video games, radio, and television will probably become increasingly common. It probably won’t be long before the major media conglomerates own most of the video game production firms as they seek to streamline production, distribution, and exhibition of music and other mass media materials.</p>
<p>Public advocates within the music and video game industries have wanted the Grammys to recognize video game music for years, especially since some Grammy-winning songs that eventually enjoyed popular release originated within video games. Traditional video gamers, however, should be very afraid. This is exactly what happened when <a href="http://www.viacom.com/Pages/default.aspx">Viacom</a> invaded MTV, and we all saw the results. Now that the Recording Academy is sticking its fingers into video games, the core teenage-male cult may start to witness even more commercialization and homogenization of the music in their once-underground medium. Video game music creators, once somewhat separate from the mainstream music industry and free to experiment in a way unknown at most of the modern corporate record labels, may now be pressured to tow the labels’ line.</p>
<p>Only time will tell how the relationship between the labels and the video game companies will develop. However, if the conglomerates’ past record with new media is any indication, the idiosyncratic array of music in many video games today may soon become an artifact of history.</p>
