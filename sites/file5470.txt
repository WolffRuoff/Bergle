								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello all! I thought that it would benefit y&#8217;all to know what exactly we&#8217;re up to over here at &#8216;Berg. So! Here&#8217;s how it works.</p>
<p><strong>Interviews</strong></p>
<p>We begin by interviewing members of the Muhlenberg community. This includes students, faculty members, working staff, administration, and anyone else we can find. All the ensemble members sit down and interview this person, which usually lasts anywhere from 20 minutes to an hour and 20 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>Transcriptions</strong></p>
<p>One of the ensemble members is assigned the interview to transcribe. This usually takes muuuuuch longer than the actual interview. I made the hilarious-in-retrospect-but-not-at-the-time mistake of transcribing my <em>entire</em> first interview, including stupid jokes, laughter, and a laundry buzzer.</p>
<p><strong>Review</strong></p>
<p>Every weeknight, we all gather in the Rehearsal House to go over whatever transcriptions we have. We project them onto a screen and go through them line by line, agreeing and disagreeing on what we think should go into the final script. This is where we currently are in the process.</p>
<p><strong>Scriptbuilding</strong></p>
<p>Soon, we&#8217;ll take all of the lines we like and hash them into a proto-script. Then we&#8217;ll cut it, cut it some more, continue to cut it, do some more removal of lines, cut it a final time, and have a script.</p>
<p><strong>Theater Things</strong></p>
<p>After that we&#8217;ll divide up lines, memorize them, block the show, and then it&#8217;s performance time!</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s how it goes. Can&#8217;t wait to see you all!</p>
