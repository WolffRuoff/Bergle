								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Social media today has a huge impact on almost all aspects of life. It can influence things like ones education, to ones ability to get a job. I&#8217;m going to focus on the influence social media has on politics. Whether you realize it or not, social media can greatly affect things in politics. We live in the age of technology and the world is more connected as ever, this means that almost anything and everything can be done through the internet. When it comes to politics, social media plays a big role in campaigns. The key point for politicians while campaigning is for them to try to get their message across to as many people as possible to try to earn their votes, technology allows a resource that helps candidates do just that. Things like Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and many other resources can reach millions of people around the world in a matter of seconds, allowing one to spread their message. The method of using social media to an advantage in political campaigns is prominent today in the ongoing 2016 presidential campaign between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. I currently follow Mr. Trump on Twitter and I see how he tries to earn votes every time he tweets. These tweets reach millions on millions of people, allowing him to talk indirectly to his voters at a very fast pace. Now there is a flip side to this, most of the people that are being reached through the internet are the younger, less active block of voters. Reaching out to millions of people is great but who is to say that all those people you are convincing to vote for you are actually going to go out and even vote. This might be the case today, however as explained by Sharon Housley, this younger generation is going to become the older generation and technology will then play an enormous role in our elections. Social media also plays a positive impact in elections through its ability to create an effective way of fundraising. In order for campaigns to run, they need money and a lot of that money is given as support through fundraisers. On a bit of a smaller scale, websites like GoFundMe.com exist today as a place specifically for helping people raise money. Online fundraising can be very effective and it can most certainty help in the fundraising for campaigns. Now these are all some positive impacts technology has on politics, there are many ways technology can be a negative impact for a politician in particular. The saying everything you put on the internet stays there forever, is very much true and well. Everything can be dug up from the depth of the internet and brought back to life, this is also been scene in the Trump vs Clinton election. A commercial, seen a lot not only on television but on Twitter and Youtube, was made by Hillary Clinton and shows an interview done many years back with Donald trump showing him saying he does not have much respect for women. This hurts his reputation towards women tremendously and will for sure put more female votes in the hands of Hillary Clinton. The social media is also a place that spreads news very fast around the world. An audio recording of Mr. Trump has been released that has him talking about women, saying that &#8220;sometimes you just have grab them by the p***y&#8221;. This is a disgusting remark towards women and because of the internet and its social media sites, everyone is aware of Mr. Trumps remarks. As you can see, the internet can be both a helpful hand or a dagger to the heart in terms of its impact on politics.</p>
