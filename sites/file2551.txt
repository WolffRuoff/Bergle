					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Love the catchy title...Interesting article here.  CinemaCon would be a kind of facilitator for the industry, and one which is designed to help exhibitors leverage their power vis-a-vis the producer/distributors.  This conference seems to be grappling with the big shift in audiences&#039; media consumption habits over the past ten years: from outwards to inwards and the home environment.  Thanks for the interesting find!&lt;/p&gt;
