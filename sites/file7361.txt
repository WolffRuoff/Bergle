								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Did they have computers when you were younger, or were they still using feathers and ink?” While I do not remember my 5 year-old self asking this question, my mother and siblings will not let me live it down. A world without technology seems like a lifetime ago; a lifetime I have never experienced.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">            For as long as I can remember, I have lived in a tech world. From the time I wake up in the morning, until the time I go to bed, I am constantly utilizing technology. “Teens ages 13 to 17 are also going online frequently. Aided by the convenience and constant access provided by mobile, 92% of teens report going online daily – with 24% using the internet “almost constantly,” 56% going online several times a day and 12% reporting once-a-day use” (Lenhart). In the matter of seconds the world is at my fingertips connecting me to everyone and everything I could ever imagine plus more. My life, for all intent and purposes, revolves around technology. From my smartphone to my laptop and wireless printer, my video games to my tablet I spend a majority of my life and waking hours using some form of technology.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">            My experience with technology began at a very young age. At the mere age of 4 I was enrolled in a computer class. While the class did not go into depth about computers and all that could be done with these devices, it did expose me to a world that would become commonplace later in life. As I grew I graduated from computer games, to Nintendo Gameboys to PSPs and currently Xbox One it allowed me to take my gaming mobile. Everywhere I went my device came with me. I never thought twice about it, and it seemed like I was not the only one. Everywhere I went I was surrounded by others enamored with (not to mention glued to) their devices&#8211; parents on their cell phones, children on Gameboys, employees on their computers. Technology was all around me and as I grew it only surrounded me more, tightening its grasp and allure.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">            As I matured so did my relationship with technology. With each new technological advancement my world grew larger, my reach became broader and the endless possibilities available to me became more abundant. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">            My family went from a household with a communal phone attached to the wall and a single desktop computer that would require us to plug into the phone line, leaving the phone incapacitated during use to laptops and smartphones connected over Wi-Fi for all and tremendous independence. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> With age I have begun to better appreciate all the benefits the ever expanding world of technology offers me. Devices such as GoogleDocs has been incredibly beneficial to me in my studies throughout high school and now in college. In many of my classes over the years I noticed an increased focus on group projects being assigned to me by my teachers which posed a challenge to me. Being the 3 sport athlete that I was throughout high school, it was not always easy finding time to meet up with my other group members to work on our assignment together. To make things easier on everyone we typically did work through GoogleDocs so that we could collaboratively work on our different parts of the project when time allowed while also enabling us to help and critique other members of the group through GroupMe. The ease of accessibility for everyone enabled more work to get done while not wasting other group members because I could not physically be there to work on the assignment with them. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Frankly, I cannot imagine a world without technology. A failure to maintain a keen knowledge of all forms of technology will undoubtedly present challenges and a loss of opportunities in almost all aspects of my life. I don’t<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>intend to pass those opportunities by.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At one point in most peoples lives, they will be impacted by technology in one way or another. For me, technology has almost always been in my life. For as long as I can remember I have had a form of technology in my possession that  has impacted my life in many different ways.   One of the very first pieces of technology that I remember using was a portable CD player. I can remember as a kid carrying this thing around everywhere I went as my most prized possession, as if it was made of gold or something. I had a carrying pouch with extra slots for different CD&#8217;s I would want to listen to and a place to carry my giant head phones. Now a days kids have iPods, iPads , and any other type of music player available on the market that is less than half the size of my old CD player and needs none of the extra accessories. But that is besides the point, this CD player was more than just a music playing device to me. It was a factor in my childhood that has ended up shaping some of my interests in music today. As a child my cousin used to baby sit my brother and I and he was huge into classic rock. He loved the bands such as the Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, and AC/DC. They  were always playing in his car, at the house, any time he could he was playing classic rock. This is how I fell in love with rock music. I starting asking him for CD&#8217;s that I can burrow and the collection kept growing. Ever since then I have always been in love with classic rock. It is mostly what I listen to today and it helps me in many ways. It helps me relieve stress in overwhelming times. It allows me to shutout what is going on around me and focus on my studies and it even gives me different messages that I can draw from each individual song. This early technology in my life also gives me a gateway to some old memories. I can remember sitting down with my cousin every couple of weeks and going over songs that he would burn on a disk for me. I had to convince him to let some explicit songs go but had to promise not to tell my mother. I also remember times me and my brother would get into fights over who got to use the CD player, I guess not much has changed from that stand point. This CD player has affected me in many positive ways that goes much deeper than just listening to music.  As you can see I have had technology in my life for a long time and this is how technology has had a very positive impact on my life even from some of my earliest years.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From what I can remember, I first used technology at three years old. I remember watching Teletubbies over and over again. Around four, my parents got me a desktop computer. I used to spend hours playing educational games and always wanting more. I had a Gameboy Advanced where I’d play Super Mario Brothers 2 and get mad at me not being able to finish levels. I once got so mad I, no joke, bit the screen and thus breaking it. After making the transition to kindergarten, I began to watch more TV and do more on the computer. All my friends were talking about that newest Spongebob episode, but I, oddly enough, was not allowed to watch it. To this day, I still haven’t seen one full episode of the show. As I got further into grade school, it was the coolest thing to have a cell phone and a DS. I remember begging my mom to get me a cell phone but she did get me a DS though. I continued to use my computer and watch TV while everyone else seemed cooler because of that phone. In the computer lab at our school, we began to learn to use the computer better on this <em>Learning.com</em> website. I don’t remember the exact site because that was grade school. It was a fun activity because it was interactive and it gave us a sense of accomplishment when we finished it. There were word games, typing puzzles, Excel, Word, and PowerPoint were some of the things I remember doing. When sixth grade rolled around, those skills were put to the test in our first research project The night I finished sixth grade, my parents took me and my sister out to hibachi, the Japanese place where they make the food in front of you. At the conclusion of dinner and desert, my mom handed me a gift. I remember thinking to myself “What’s this for?” before blurting it out my mouth. She just told me to open it. Doing as she instructed, I unwrapped a new phone. I was so happy that this wish of mine came true. I don’t remember what it was but I loved it. It had a slide out keyboard and I could load games onto it. I ended up dropping it half way through seventh grade and my parents upgraded me to a Pantech Laser with the same slide out keyboard. That got me to High School. In eighth grade, specifically on my sister’s birthday, we both got a box. We opened them to find paper iPhones. My sister and I were so confused. We ended up each getting an iPhone 4 while my parents got the 4s. In 9<sup>th</sup> grade, I remember playing it in class. I got caught one too many times and I got my apps taken off for good. I was so distressed. In 10<sup>th</sup> grade, I began watching YouTube videos through Safari on cellular data at lunch. I used my data so fast I really needed to tone it down. After I got Safari taken away, I just stopped really using the phone until iOS 7 came around. iTunes Radio got me through the 45-minute, 6:20am bus ride to school and the 2:12pm, 30-minute bus ride back still using data. My parents upgraded to a shared 10GB plan; I still used 75% of the total data every month. I got an Instagram account but deleted it soon after because I really didn’t have much to do on it. Then, earlier this year, my parents decided to take us on a “family trip” that my sister and I were not given any information about. They ended up getting us the iPhone 6s. A few months ago, my grandmother offered to get me a computer for use at school. This turned into the mac that I use. I had used a Mac since 2009 when my mom got a MacBook pro. It seemed easier to use and paired well with our iPhones. This completes my technology timeline for now as the future holds a great many secrets ready to be uncovered.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since technology has always been a part of my life, I have never stopped to reflect on the impact it has had on my life. Although I am not sure if the implications are positive or negative, I know I would not have the same interests today if technology wasn’t a player.</p>
<p>My earliest memories of technology are playing with my Leapster and reading from my LeapPad. The Leapster was an educational gaming system, on which I remember playing a dog game. The player would have to take care of the dogs by doing math problems. As a math major, I see that this could be where my love for math roots from. The LeapPad was a device that you could attach books to, and it would read them to you and have activities about the book at the end. I now understand why I liked my LeapPad so much—I am an auditory learner, and often listen to audiobooks.</p>
<p>Like many other children, I loved watching TV. My favorite show growing up was <i>Blues Clues</i>, where a dog named Blue would leave clues that would help solve a mystery by the end of the program. I enjoyed the variety of characters and the bright colors used to design them. I also loved to watch princess movies. I would go to the library to take out the VHS of <i>Belle’s Tales of Friendship</i>, watch it everyday, and return it by the three day deadline, just to take it out again the next day.</p>
<p>Years later, I got a phone after my sixth grade graduation, and I find this to be a pivotal point in my technological life since it was my first gateway to communication through technology. It was a Samsung Intensity, which had a slide-out keyboard. I thought having a phone like this would make me &#8220;cool&#8221; amongst my peers, since many of them already had phones. However, I found that the hype was much greater than the actual experience; I did not text people often nor did the phone have Internet capabilities. Yet I found that having a phone provided a false sense of comfort, which I still believe hold today.</p>
<p>It would be four years until I had an iPhone. I got the iPhone 5c (in blue) and I found that it changed my life it many different ways. I had Internet access on the family computer at home, but now i had the Internet in my pocket. My parents put restrictions on my phone, but I had still upgraded from my slide phone. I did not have any social media accounts until I turned 18, but I always watched YouTube. I have always been entertained by a variety of content creators, including comedians, vloggers (video bloggers), dancers, and gymnasts. Watching YouTube often has shifted my time management, and has probably affected my sleep patterns. However, I would never stop watching YouTube because this is where I find creative inspiration.</p>
<p>When I turned 18, I finally logged onto Facebook and Instagram, with intentions of using it to find Muhlenberg students. As expected, it has become much more than that. Now in college, I find that Facebook is one of the best ways to connect with my friends &amp; family. I make sure to also post lots of pictures so others can feel the same sense of connection.</p>
<p>My parents gifted me with a MacBook for college, and I mainly use it to read online articles for coursework and type on the Pages application. Another tool I use is Wolfram Alpha, which is a scholarly form of Google. According to our Technology Survey, I am the only person that answered that I use it (Hertel, 2016). I love Wolfram Alpha, and it is especially useful for math, because sometimes it is hard to get math help on Google. I can imagine that there are apps or websites that I am aware of that are just as useful as Wolfram Alpha that I can someday bring into my technological tool belt.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whenever I go through my home videos, I always stumble upon videos of me doing what I loved as a kid: watching TV. Barnie, The Wiggles, Blue&#8217;s Clues; you name it, I probably have watched it. Given that I was an extremely shy child, I always preferred staying at home rather than playing at the playground with my classmates. I feel that this deep-seated my love for technology.</p>
<p>This love for technology grew exponentially when I was introduced to video games. When I was about six years old, my parents bought me a Gameboy. Shortly, this hand-held gaming device never left my hands. I would use it to play games such as Pokemon, and I would also watch countless episodes of The Fairly Odd Parents on it when when traveling with no TV. I thought this gadget was the greatest invention ever. Little did I know how much I would love the Gamecube, which I got when I was seven. I was mind-blown by this gadget because it could connect to my TV and had more intricate buttons to press compared to the Gameboy. By then, I was <strong>hooked.</strong> I had a daily routine of getting up 2-3 hours before I had to go to school so I could play my favorite games, such as Monkeyball. Not only that, but as soon as I would get home from school, I would run straight to my Gamecube to play some more. It didn&#8217;t take long for my parents to realize that I had an unhealthy obsession. I was distraught when they had to restrain me from playing for so many hours a day, but now I am thankful that they did so because I became more focused on schoolwork and playing with my friends.</p>
<p>My technology obsession took a hiatus for a while until I got a Wii when I was ten. This Christmas gift was the greatest thing ever because not only was it a gadget that required motion, but it had adapters for Gamecube users so that I could still play my Gamecube games. It was like I had the best of both worlds! My favorite game was Guitar Hero III. That year I had attempted to learn how to play the guitar, but I gave up rather quickly because it was too challenging. Playing Guitar Hero brought out my inner guitar player wannabe. Guitar Hero taught me what determination feels like; I was not going to stop until I reached the expert level. Once I reached my goal, I felt so accomplished that I couldn&#8217;t help but gloat to my friends.</p>
<p>My constant texting habit that I still have today dates back to my first phone that I got for my 11th birthday. I thought I was hooked when it came to my Gameboy, but I was 10 times more hooked to my phone. It never left my sight (unless if my parents took it away). Nowadays I haven&#8217;t changed much, but I am more aware about how much of a distraction phones are so I try my best to focus on more important things. I feel that my obsession with technology for almost my whole life exposes my shyness because it has always been an outlet of entertainment when I feel bored or lonely, rather than conversing with people face-to-face. Sometimes, I wish I was like Brian O&#8217;Neill in &#8220;Teens Who Say No To Social Media&#8221; by Christine Rosen because he &#8220;doesn&#8217;t need social media to stay in touch&#8221; (Rosen 2016). Without social media, I would feel out of the loop because almost all of my friends post what is going on in their lives on a daily basis. Sometimes I miss the days before I started using social media because I didn&#8217;t feel stressed over how many likes I got on a picture that I posted. I do recognize that this is a silly thing to stress about because &#8216;likes&#8217; don&#8217;t matter, but I have yet to completely stop caring and worrying about it. Though I do feel satisfied when I do get a lot of likes, it unfortunately shows how much I care about what others think about me, and I should only focus on how I think about myself.</p>
