					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Dr. Baldridge was the best.  Quickest wit and mind.  I remember in a senior seminar class, Dr.  B asked where one of our fellow classmates was.  We remained silent until one of us said he had pulled an all-nighter and was still in bed.  With that Dr. B, went to his office pulled his land-line phone into our classroom and called the MIA student.  The conversation was one for the ages.  Dr. B told our classmate that class would not begin until he arrived.  Within a few minutes, we could see him sprinting across campus as he  finished dressing himself.  The laughter still resonates.&lt;/p&gt;
