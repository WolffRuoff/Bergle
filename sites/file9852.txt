Gladwell&#8217;s conclusion, after studying how people make instant decisions in a  wide range of fields from psychology to police work, is that we can make better  instant judgments by training our mind and senses to focus on the most relevant  facts-and that less input (as long as it&#8217;s the right input) is better than  more.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>On Nov. 10 at 4:30 p.m., Chaplain Peter Bredlau will lead a discussion in the library (Periodicals Reading Room) on Malcolm Gladwell&#8217;s bestsellers: Blink, The Tipping Point, Outliers.
