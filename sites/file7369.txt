								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Did they have computers when you were younger, or were they still using feathers and ink?” While I do not remember my 5 year-old self asking this question, my mother and siblings will not let me live it down. A world without technology seems like a lifetime ago; a lifetime I have never experienced.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">            For as long as I can remember, I have lived in a tech world. From the time I wake up in the morning, until the time I go to bed, I am constantly utilizing technology. “Teens ages 13 to 17 are also going online frequently. Aided by the convenience and constant access provided by mobile, 92% of teens report going online daily – with 24% using the internet “almost constantly,” 56% going online several times a day and 12% reporting once-a-day use” (Lenhart). In the matter of seconds the world is at my fingertips connecting me to everyone and everything I could ever imagine plus more. My life, for all intent and purposes, revolves around technology. From my smartphone to my laptop and wireless printer, my video games to my tablet I spend a majority of my life and waking hours using some form of technology.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">            My experience with technology began at a very young age. At the mere age of 4 I was enrolled in a computer class. While the class did not go into depth about computers and all that could be done with these devices, it did expose me to a world that would become commonplace later in life. As I grew I graduated from computer games, to Nintendo Gameboys to PSPs and currently Xbox One it allowed me to take my gaming mobile. Everywhere I went my device came with me. I never thought twice about it, and it seemed like I was not the only one. Everywhere I went I was surrounded by others enamored with (not to mention glued to) their devices&#8211; parents on their cell phones, children on Gameboys, employees on their computers. Technology was all around me and as I grew it only surrounded me more, tightening its grasp and allure.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">            As I matured so did my relationship with technology. With each new technological advancement my world grew larger, my reach became broader and the endless possibilities available to me became more abundant. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">            My family went from a household with a communal phone attached to the wall and a single desktop computer that would require us to plug into the phone line, leaving the phone incapacitated during use to laptops and smartphones connected over Wi-Fi for all and tremendous independence. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> With age I have begun to better appreciate all the benefits the ever expanding world of technology offers me. Devices such as GoogleDocs has been incredibly beneficial to me in my studies throughout high school and now in college. In many of my classes over the years I noticed an increased focus on group projects being assigned to me by my teachers which posed a challenge to me. Being the 3 sport athlete that I was throughout high school, it was not always easy finding time to meet up with my other group members to work on our assignment together. To make things easier on everyone we typically did work through GoogleDocs so that we could collaboratively work on our different parts of the project when time allowed while also enabling us to help and critique other members of the group through GroupMe. The ease of accessibility for everyone enabled more work to get done while not wasting other group members because I could not physically be there to work on the assignment with them. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Frankly, I cannot imagine a world without technology. A failure to maintain a keen knowledge of all forms of technology will undoubtedly present challenges and a loss of opportunities in almost all aspects of my life. I don’t<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>intend to pass those opportunities by.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From what I can remember, I first used technology at three years old. I remember watching Teletubbies over and over again. Around four, my parents got me a desktop computer. I used to spend hours playing educational games and always wanting more. I had a Gameboy Advanced where I’d play Super Mario Brothers 2 and get mad at me not being able to finish levels. I once got so mad I, no joke, bit the screen and thus breaking it. After making the transition to kindergarten, I began to watch more TV and do more on the computer. All my friends were talking about that newest Spongebob episode, but I, oddly enough, was not allowed to watch it. To this day, I still haven’t seen one full episode of the show. As I got further into grade school, it was the coolest thing to have a cell phone and a DS. I remember begging my mom to get me a cell phone but she did get me a DS though. I continued to use my computer and watch TV while everyone else seemed cooler because of that phone. In the computer lab at our school, we began to learn to use the computer better on this <em>Learning.com</em> website. I don’t remember the exact site because that was grade school. It was a fun activity because it was interactive and it gave us a sense of accomplishment when we finished it. There were word games, typing puzzles, Excel, Word, and PowerPoint were some of the things I remember doing. When sixth grade rolled around, those skills were put to the test in our first research project The night I finished sixth grade, my parents took me and my sister out to hibachi, the Japanese place where they make the food in front of you. At the conclusion of dinner and desert, my mom handed me a gift. I remember thinking to myself “What’s this for?” before blurting it out my mouth. She just told me to open it. Doing as she instructed, I unwrapped a new phone. I was so happy that this wish of mine came true. I don’t remember what it was but I loved it. It had a slide out keyboard and I could load games onto it. I ended up dropping it half way through seventh grade and my parents upgraded me to a Pantech Laser with the same slide out keyboard. That got me to High School. In eighth grade, specifically on my sister’s birthday, we both got a box. We opened them to find paper iPhones. My sister and I were so confused. We ended up each getting an iPhone 4 while my parents got the 4s. In 9<sup>th</sup> grade, I remember playing it in class. I got caught one too many times and I got my apps taken off for good. I was so distressed. In 10<sup>th</sup> grade, I began watching YouTube videos through Safari on cellular data at lunch. I used my data so fast I really needed to tone it down. After I got Safari taken away, I just stopped really using the phone until iOS 7 came around. iTunes Radio got me through the 45-minute, 6:20am bus ride to school and the 2:12pm, 30-minute bus ride back still using data. My parents upgraded to a shared 10GB plan; I still used 75% of the total data every month. I got an Instagram account but deleted it soon after because I really didn’t have much to do on it. Then, earlier this year, my parents decided to take us on a “family trip” that my sister and I were not given any information about. They ended up getting us the iPhone 6s. A few months ago, my grandmother offered to get me a computer for use at school. This turned into the mac that I use. I had used a Mac since 2009 when my mom got a MacBook pro. It seemed easier to use and paired well with our iPhones. This completes my technology timeline for now as the future holds a great many secrets ready to be uncovered.</p>
