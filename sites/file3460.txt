								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fernandez, Jay A. (2011, April 14). Roundtable: the writers behind summer&#8217;s biggest blockbusters (exclusive video). <em>The Hollywood Reporter. </em>Retrieved from <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/risky-business/roundtable-writers-summers-biggest-blockbusters-177491">http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/risky-business/roundtable-writers-summers-biggest-blockbusters-177491</a><a href="http://mediaindustries11.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/04/2558435938_dc8097fd79.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1106" src="http://mediaindustries11.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/04/2558435938_dc8097fd79-300x260.jpg" alt="" width="184" height="111" /></a></p>
<p>With the summer fast approaching, the pressure on Hollywood screenwriters is beginning to mount. Summer blockbusters or &#8220;tentpoles&#8221;, while not necessarily containing the same topics or plotlines, tend to share a lot of the same elements. Much like the season itself, summer blockbusters are designed by filmmakers and marketed by studios to &#8220;make you cheer, make you gasp, and make you laugh,&#8221; according to Ehren Kruger, screenwriter of <em>Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, </em>in a Hollywood Reporter roundtable discussion with Hollywood screenwriters. These blockbusters are not typically designed to capture the attention of Oscar voters; instead, studios pour countless amounts of money into these films&#8217; budgets in order to regain profits and more. &#8220;These movies are greenlit now based on pre-visualized animated sequences that are the action sequences or moments that are really designed to wow the audience or stand out in a trailer,&#8221; said Kruger. Kruger&#8217;s quote exemplifies how summer blockbusters are designed first and foremost to appeal to a widespread audience. In order to accomplish this, studios look at past moneymakers and formulas that tend to appeal to the masses, and often design these summer blockbusters with these precedents in mind. Fundamentally, the studios are out to maximize profits when making these blockbusters. The main objective isn&#8217;t always necessarily making a film with quality of the highest caliber. Instead, money is what makes the industries continue churning out these massively-budgeted films year after year.<span id="more-1104"></span></p>
<p>When writing these films in the first place, Hollywood screenwriters face pressure to come up with &#8220;fresh&#8221; ideas that will capture the attention of audiences. Additionally, they must keep in mind how their films can function as collaborative efforts with other industries. Cross-promotion is one of the most effective and essential forms of spreading the word about a film and creating a successful summer blockbuster. Cross-promotion is essentially when consumers of one product are targeted, in a marketing sense, by the promotion of another product. Summer blockbusters are well-known in Hollywood as utilizing cross-promotion; as an example, animated films aimed at children are often promoted through toys in kids&#8217; meals at fast food restaurants like McDonald&#8217;s and Burger King.</p>
<p>Similarly, companies often pay studio substantial amounts of money to have their products featured in some way in a film they believe might be popular, a practice known as product placement. A notable example of this is when Hershey paid Steven Spielberg and Universal to feature Reeses&#8217; Pieces in the film <em>E.T.</em>, which paid off when <em>E.T. </em>became a global success. Both cross-promotion and product placement are considered linking pins with the film industry, as money can be made both promoting films and other products in other industries, such as fast food restaurants.</p>
<p>Two upcoming summer blockbusters will use both product placement and forms of cross-promotional merchandising in order to enhance the visibility of these films in the marketplace. The upcoming superhero film <em>Green Lantern</em> will feature a prominent use of product placement. In the film, the main character&#8217;s mode of transportation is a Chevy Volt, a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle that has only been on the market since December 2010. To accomplish this, Chevrolet struck a deal with Warner Bros., <em>Green Lantern</em>&#8216;s studio, to feature the car prominently. This is an example of two separate industries collaborating financially in a mutually beneficial effort.</p>
<p>In terms of cross-promotion, DreamWorks&#8217; upcoming animated sequel <em>Kung Fu Panda 2 </em>will feature plush toys found in McDonalds&#8217; Happy Meals. In the <em>Hollywood Reporter</em> roundtable, the film&#8217;s screenwriter Jonathan Aibel said, &#8220;There&#8217;s nothing wrong with advertising as long as you feel like you&#8217;re not selling out your characters too much and you&#8217;re still being true to them.&#8221; This is likely a common mindset among the various people involved with making and advertising summer blockbusters. While the actual quality of these summer blockbusters is often hit or miss and/or up for debate, the fact remains that producers in the film industry have their eye on financial success. Above all else, the film industry is a business, and people involved with making these summer blockbusters want to make money.</p>
