								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is difficult to believe, but Thanksgiving is around the corner. Over the past few weeks, our class has discussed issues of child maltreatment, ADHD and severe conduct problems.  In the next week we  begin discussing anxiety problems in children. Also, this past week, we had a very important discussion about professional “burnout” and the value in thinking about how to prevent or manage it.</p>
<p>The student contributions in this installment of the blog highlight some important issues from the past several weeks, with several students writing about the various developmental pathways in conduct problems. In the internet resources section, you will also find a wide range of resources on child maltreatment, ADHD, and neurodiversity.</p>
<p><strong>Coming Up…</strong></p>
<p><u>After Thanksgiving, there will only be about two weeks left in the semester</u>! Students are expected to continue at their placements until the last day of classes on December 7<sup>th</sup>. Students should also be working on their service projects and thinking about how to best approach the final visits to their placements. Over the next few weeks, we will focus our class time on discussing anxiety disorders, mood disorders, and resilience in children. Please feel free to ask our students about what they are learning and share your own experiences.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>All students are now well into their service learning placements and they are very excited about their experiences. After each visit, students submit “reflective” journals in which they share their observations and raise questions about what they have experienced. At least once a week, we have a “check in” discussion during class, where students talk with each other about what they are seeing in their placements. This is an opportunity for students to share significant observations and help each other make sense of those observations. One of the things I believe is most valuable about these discussions is that they provide a chance for students to question some of their initial assumptions and reactions to what they experienced. For instance, students who go to the same placement on different days may come to very different conclusions about a given child or his/her behavior. When this happens, we are able to explore and dismantle some simplistic assumptions about why the child behaved that way (e.g., maybe he isn’t just an oppositional child by nature).</p>
<p>Over the past few weeks, we have finished discussion of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs). Specifically, we examined core characteristics of Autism and Asperger’s syndrome. Students discussed some recent eye-tracking research on the nature of social information processing in autism. This research may provide insight into the difficulties children with autism often having in reading social cues. They also examined the recent changes in the DSM classification of ASDs. We also recently began to discuss issues of child maltreatment.</p>
<p><strong>Coming up…</strong></p>
<p>In the next week or two, we will be learning about ADHD and disruptive behavior disorders. We will examine changes in the diagnostic criteria for ADHD and will critically examine pubic perceptions of “overdiagnosis”. We will also approaches to the treatment of ADHD.</p>
<p>**Finally, over the course of the next 2 or 3 visits, students should approach you with ideas for a service project. This is a major component of their service learning experience and requires that the students consult with their site supervisors.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to the first installment of our  Fall 2018 course blog! In previous years, we have composed a newsletter to help keep our community partners informed about what is going on inside the classroom. To make information more accessible, I have transformed the newsletter into electronic form. I hope you find this approach easier to access and that the blog will provide both students and partners with a foundation for meaningful discussions about their work with children.</p>
<p>Let me begin by once again extending a formal thank you to all of our community partners for continuing to work so effectively with our students. This year we have 4 different community partners. Students in this year’s class are working with community partners in the Allentown schools (Jefferson Elementary, Roosevelt Elementary, Muhlenberg Elementary)  and the Autism Resource Community Hub of Lehigh Valley (ARCH).  Such a diverse variety of experiences greatly enriches our classroom discussions.</p>
<p>In the blog,  students will write brief essays that highlight a specific issue or reading discussed in our class. In the first installment, Isabella Zissman has written a brief essay about resilience in children. In class, we discussed an article that describes core characteristics of children&#8217;s ability to respond to adversity, including the role of caring adults.  Evan Bloch wrote about the concept of &#8220;Neurodiversity&#8221;. He outlines the argument that we might be well served by viewing children&#8217;s difference in context&#8230;that sometimes differences are not necessarily deficits.  Both essays are located in the Student Essays section of the blog.  Also, in the Internet Resources section, Eden Keinan (Autism resources) and Julie Weikart (naming/labeling effects) have provided a few internet resources that we hope you will find helpful. Please check them out!</p>
