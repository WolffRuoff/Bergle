								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Calkins, T., &amp; Rucker, D. (2011, February 3). Will Social Media Slay the Super Bowl? Retrieved February 5, 2011, from <a href="http://adage.com/cmostrategy/article?article_id=148644">http://adage.com/cmostrategy/article?article_id=148644</a></p>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://realvision.ae/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/pepsi_superbowl_miniscreen_social_media-300x226.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="226" />Companies are spending less money advertising during the Super Bowl and putting more funding and efforts into social media marketing because some companies feel that social media is more useful in developing brand recognition. The key to brand recognition is what the authors refer to as engagement with the audience. They discuss the barriers to online engagement, such as pop-up blockers and users on Facebook and Twitter, who may follow or become fans of a company’s page, but not actively participate with the brand. The authors argue that Superbowl ads are still more effective at engaging audiences because they generate buzz.<br />
<span id="more-727"></span></p>
<blockquote><p>Many people watch the Super Bowl primarily for the advertising, which they then continue to talk about afterward. The ads are posted on YouTube and countless blogs; news outlets comment on them and people discuss them in the office the next day.</p></blockquote>
<p>Consumers are currently spending as much time on the Internet or their smart-phones as they do watching television, so advertisers must flock to where the the viewers are. Despite this, even the companies with the greatest social presences can fail to capture the attention of consumers. Changing times and technologies challenge companies to capture the buzz generated from Superbowl advertising and carry it into social media platforms. The most effective advertising integrates different forms of media to create synergistic engagement with consumers across multiple platforms and at every aspect of a consumer’s day. As consumers spend more time online, advertising dollars will shift to online advertising, to be where the consumer spends the most time.</p>
<p>If more companies go the path of Ford and Pepsi and choose to spend their advertising dollars online rather than paying for, at most, minutes during the Super Bowl, it could have a significant impact on the television industry, and putting money into television advertisements will be less cost effective. As a result of these trends the Internet advertising industry will increase in usage.</p>
<p>Advertising agencies, as the creators/producers, need to work harder to ensure that they engage the appropriate audiences through the right channels for their specific clients, especially due to the fast changes in technology. Additionally, social media platforms are becoming more powerful exhibitors in the advertising world.</p>
