								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Selection Committee members are reviewing the responses in three groups of two. The Committee has been broken up into the following teams:</p>
<p><strong>Jenzabar </strong>&#8211; Tim Clark and Karen Schall</p>
<p><strong>Colleague</strong> – Mark Mazer and Aaron Bova</p>
<p><strong>Unit4</strong><strong> </strong>  &#8211; Melissa Falk and Andi Gillespie</p>
<p>Each group is charged with creating a summary of their assigned vendor. These summaries will be concatenated and broadcast to the Steering Committee on a weekly basis.</p>
<p>Part of the groups’ responsibility is to review the responses to the requirements. Any items that look questionable or less than optimal will be reviewed with both the department who is impacted by this requirement and the vendor when necessary. Subsequent demos are encouraged to solidify our understanding of the requirement responses.</p>
<p>If you have questions about a particular requirement for a specific vendor, feel free to reach out to the Selection Committee and/or John Glasgow for clarifications.</p>
<p>The Steering Committee will receive weekly reports from the Selection Committee and will have the opportunity to give and receive feedback from the Selection Committee and/or Vendors over the next month&#8211;our plan for the joint meeting in mid-July is for the Selection Committee to make their product presentations to the Steering Committee.  We will have time for group discussion and if we believe we are ready to do so, vote.  John has built a two week window into the process&#8211;if we find we need more information to make our decision, we have time to ask further questions before voting and sending our joint recommendation on to the President&#8217;s Staff for final approval.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ORACLE IS NO LONGER A CANDIDATE</p>
<p>The first meeting between Steering and Selection was indeed productive.  As part of the process, the Steering and Selection Committees voted to remove Oracle as a vendor choice.  It was the committees&#8217; opinion that Oracle, despite it&#8217;s maturity as a company, does not have a mature product in the liberal arts college space.</p>
<p>Please disregard any communications you may have seen in the past about Oracle for the ERP Selection Process.  If you see something that references Oracle, feel free to contact me, John Glasgow.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The demonstrations are scheduled and we are excited to have everyone attend.  The Selection and Steering Committees have come up with a good list of everything they want to see from the different products.</p>
<p>There will be surveys for everyone to fill out who attended the sessions.  Your feedback is very important to us as it will help in the decision making process.</p>
<p>Members of the Steering and Selection Committees, REMEMBER you need to be reviewing their requirements with their departments to come up with the best possible lists to provide for the RFI.  The requirements are the most crucial part of the success of the selection process.  The more concise and refined documents need to be returned by the end of March.</p>
<h2>Demo Schedules are now easier to find</h2>
<p>There are more navigation options to get to the demo schedules.  There are even printer friendly options available.  Mark your GroupWise calendars today!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As we are preparing for the on campus demonstrations of the various systems, I would like to take a moment to go over with you the steps we are going to take in the coming weeks. There are two important tasks being done at the same time leading up to the demos; interviewing various institutions who are using these products, and preparing for the demos. In this correspondence, we will be addressing the vendor demonstrations.</p>
<p>Currently, we are in the phase of creating the itineraries for the vendors. We are compiling lists of items the groups would like to see from the vendors. We will be looking to using these demos as an opportunity to investigate these products further.</p>
<p>Getting the demo themes to the vendors in December will allow them to allocate experts from their business to come to the college for the live demos as well as allow us to schedule the demos for the February/March timeframe.</p>
<p>We will be working toward solidifying dates with the vendors. Some of the durations of the presentations will be shorter, others longer, based on the strengths and weaknesses of each vendor. Some, as an example, might not have an Advancement module, so some accommodation will have to be taken into account for this.</p>
<p>Once the demos have started, in February/March, everyone is invited to attend the sessions. At the sessions, there will be paper surveys to fill out to give us an idea of your thoughts on the product for that session. These paper surveys are also going to have a link to the ERP website as well as to an online survey (if you would rather complete the survey electronically).</p>
<p>The information gathered from the surveys will be presented to the Steering Committee. At that point we will reduce the number of vendors that we wish to pursue further. This will save us time that we can then use to delve into the intricacies of the remaining products. The information that is gained from these further reviews can be used to further craft the requirements for the Request for Information (RFI).</p>
<p>As we head into March, a copy of the RFI will be sent to each of the remaining vendors. It will give us more detailed information as to what the capabilities and limitations are. The response will also include if there are add-ins we would need to purchase from the vendor or a 3rd party. This portion of the process will take roughly 2 months for the responses to get back to us.</p>
<p>In May, we will start to get the responses to the RFI. These responses will be looked at thoroughly by the Selection Committee. We will compile a list of questions for each department based on the information from the RFI. This will be used to find any &#8220;deal breakers&#8221;. Based on a scoring system, the Selection Committee will propose a vendor/product to Steering Committee to ratify. Based on that ratification, it will get final approval from the Executive Committee. This process should be done by July, 2016.</p>
