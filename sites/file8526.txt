<p>In this article, Jessica Winter explains the science and psychology behind why not only Facebook is the “frenemy with the most heads,” (Winter, 2013, p.2) but more importantly why Instagram is the greatest threat to our mental well-being. Winter argues that our social media outlets reduce us as individuals to a whole new level of shallowness.</p>
<p>Instagram is one out of many socia media sites that makes it extremely easy to morph a sub-par photo into a top of the line photo you would find on the front of a magazine. These days, there are countless amounts of editing apps that can not only brighten or sharpen a picture, but can change a person’s skin tone, make blemishes disappear, smooth out wrinkles, and even make a person’s teeth whiter. This kind of false advertisement is the reason “You get more explicit and implicit cues of people being happy, rich, and successful from a photo than from a status update” (Winter, 2013, p.3). People will spend hours upon hours experimenting with different filters and editing every small imperfection in order to create the “perfect” Instagram post. Not only this, but then they have to come up with the “perfect” witty and creative caption to capture their followers’ attentions. People will even spend hours simply dwelling over which emoji or hashtag is best to use. Although I myself am faulty of the endless battle of what filter to use, which caption to write, and what emoji looks best, I do realize that it is insane how much effort goes into just one photo. And why put all of this energy into an Instagram post? The one and only answer is: LIKES! Instagram is the one form of social media where getting the <u>most</u> likes is the <u>most</u> important. A lot of people think that the more likes a person gets, the more they are liked in the “real world.” However, this theory can be far from the truth. People are so obsessed with getting likes on their photos that there are even businesses you can pay to buy likes. It is absurd!</p>
<p>“Krasnova’s research has led her to define what she calls an “envy spiral” peculiar to social media. “If you see beautiful photos of your friend on Instagram,” she says, “one way to compensate is to self-present with even better photos, and then your friend sees your photos and posts <em>even</em> <em>better</em> photos, and so on” (Winter, 2013, p.3). Although Krasnova may be making a valid point, I don’t believe it is right to generalize this conclusion to the whole population of social media users. Your personal reaction to others’ posts and pictures is merely a reflection of your own character and self-worth. If you dwell in self-pity and jealousy, it is inevitable that you will “enter into a semi-consensual sadomasochistic relationship” (Winter, 2013, p.2) with social media. It is not the filtered, over-edited picture of your skinny friend in a bikini at the beach that is to blame, it is yourself.</p>
