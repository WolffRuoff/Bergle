<p>By Emily Robinson &#8217;19, Public Services Assistant at Trexler Library</p>



<p><em><strong>During the spring semester of 2020, we will be offering a series of blog posts that highlight little-known&nbsp;stories of women who have played a role in Muhlenberg&#8217;s history. This series is designed to accompany the Special Collections exhibit&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://trexler.muhlenberg.edu/library/specialcollections/exhibits/" target="_blank">An Innovation Revisited: 170 Years of Women on Campus</a>, on display in the Rare Books Exhibit Room (Level B) until April 24th.</strong></em></p>



<p>Dr. Bertha Paulssen made history at Muhlenberg College when she became the Institution’s first female teaching faculty member in 1943. Paulssen, an internationally known sociologist, was born in Leipzig, Germany in 1891, to a family that was well-versed in English as both a spoken and written language, therefore allowing her to become proficient in the language before she began her academic career. She completed her undergraduate work at the Universities of Goettingen and Leipzig and went on to earn her doctorate of philosophy from the University of Leipzig in 1917.<br></p>



<p>In 1923, at the age of 32, Paulssen moved to Hamburg, Germany to serve as the State Commissioner of the Hamburg State Youth Welfare Department, where she led a staff of 800 social workers. She held this position for the next decade, until Hitler seized the German government in 1933. Paulssen’s disagreements with the Nazi Party’s perverted manipulation of German youth forced her to resign her position and flee Germany. She fled to England where she was able to continue her social work in both London and Birmingham from 1934 to 1936, after which she moved to the United States.&nbsp;<br></p>

<p>After arriving in America, Paulssen became an active social worker in the Henry Street Settlement in New York. In 1938, she was brought on as a special lecturer in social work at Wagner College, and just shortly after, accepted a temporary appointment at the Lutheran Theological Seminary in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. Paulssen and her work were closely connected to the Lutheran Church throughout her life, even as early as her time in Germany, so an appointment at the Lutheran Seminary seemed an apt placement, as was her connection to Muhlenberg College, a fellow Lutheran institution. Dr. Paulssen was brought to Muhlenberg as a professor of sociology in 1943. Despite any hesitations that members of the Muhlenberg faculty and administration may have had about bringing in a female faculty member, Paulssen’s robust resume of social science experience was enough to convince President Levering Tyson that Paulssen should be given the position. In a <em>Muhlenberg Weekly</em> editorial from January 1943, the Muhlenberg staff wrote:<br></p>



<p><em>“Since having a woman member of the faculty is something very new to us, there may be some instances when we won’t quite react in the orthodox manner. However, we ask you to forgive us and bear with us until each of us has become used to each other.”</em><br></p>



<p>Dr. Paulssen taught at Muhlenberg through 1944 before returning to the Lutheran Theological Seminary, where she remained for the rest of her career— introducing social sciences into their curriculum and becoming the first female faculty member to gain tenure at a Lutheran seminary. Dr. James Swain, chair of Muhlenberg’s Social Studies Department, said that “bringing in a woman professor is an innovation,” and the addition of Paulssen to Muhlenberg faculty certainly fueled innovation for the College. Although she had a short tenure at Muhlenberg, Dr. Bertha Paulssen permanently changed the make-up of Muhlenberg faculty and paved the way for an enlightened understanding of women’s roles at the College moving forward.<br></p>

<p><em><strong>During the spring semester of 2020, we will be offering a series of blog posts that highlight little-known stories of women who have played a role in Muhlenberg&#8217;s history.

<p>Two or three summers ago, a panoramic photograph entitled “Muhlenberg College Summer School 1927” popped up on eBay. We purchased the image, happy to add to the archives and be able to further illustrate the story of the Extension School (now the Muhlenberg College School of Continuing Studies).&nbsp;<br></p>

<p>In the early twentieth century, there was increasing interest on the part of local teachers in upgrading and standardizing their educations to meet the more stringent certification requirements that were being established by educational administrative bodies. In the autumn of 1909, Muhlenberg College opened the Saturday School for Teachers. Twenty students, both male and female, enrolled during the 1909-1910 academic year. The courses taught during that first program included physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics, ancient and modern languages, and English.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The program grew slowly but steadily: in 1915, the first Summer School was established. In addition to traditional academic subjects, courses in agriculture, calisthenics, and domestic science were offered. In 1917, Dr. Isaac Wright became the director of the Department of Philosophy and Pedagogy at Muhlenberg, or what became known as the Extension Division. The program grew rapidly; soon there were more students enrolled in the Extension School than in the regular College. Courses were offered throughout neighboring cities and counties.</p>



<p>When the photograph arrived and we unrolled the curled-up image, we found, right in the middle, the image of a black woman. This was a revelation, because, according to College records and the archives, the first black students at Muhlenberg were <a href="https://www.muhlenberg.edu/blackhistorymonth2017/thepioneers/">five men</a> who joined the regular residential College in 1947. Unfortunately, the 1927 photograph is not labeled by student name, and the Registrar’s office has no records relating to the Extension School enrollment in that period.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When planning for the current exhibit <a href="http://trexler.muhlenberg.edu/library/specialcollections/exhibits/"><em>An Innovation Revisited: 170 years of women on campus</em></a><em>, </em>in which we were telling little-known stories of women in Muhlenberg’s history, we thought this would be the perfect time for the anonymous woman to make her debut. We shared her image on social media and focused on the image in a <a href="https://www.wfmz.com/video/history-s-headlines-a-lot-longer-than-you-think/video_89b4e50b-50e9-5c37-8bab-995bd5a3a56c.html">local news segment</a>,&nbsp; in the hopes that she had been a local resident and her children or grandchildren might recognize her. And then we settled in for some old-fashioned historical legwork.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A search of the<em> Morning Call</em> from 1927 revealed a reprint of our panoramic photograph, followed by a list of students in the Summer School, along with their towns of residence…..180 women and 201 men. She was somewhere on that list.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We then began cross-referencing the names and towns in the <em>Morning Call</em> with the United States census. In addition to names, occupations, addresses, and languages spoken, the census records race. Working through the women’s names alphabetically, we had gotten through about 102&#8211;through the letter “K”&#8211;when we came across Clara I. Lane, of Bethlehem.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Clara Isabella Lane (1899-1936) was the daughter of Clara B. and Abram Lane of 627 Cherokee Street, Bethlehem. She graduated second in her class at South Bethlehem High School in 1918, <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=cFoEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA191&amp;lpg=PA191&amp;dq=%22clara+lane%22+atlantic+city+high+school&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6J8_ozhZBT&amp;sig=ACfU3U2TNvEIvVqMqjiX-tcDGloSVzdzDA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjQi_GSu9jnAhWldd8KHY9CDf4Q6AEwAHoECAcQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22clara%20lane%22%20atlantic%20city%20high%20school&amp;f=false">according to <em>The Crisis</em></a><em>,</em> the periodical of the NAACP. The <em>Morning Call</em> lists her as a participant in local oratorical contests. Upon graduation, <a href="https://archive.org/details/serpentine1920west/page/66/mode/2up/search/lane">she attended </a>West Chester State Normal School (now West Chester University).&nbsp; A “normal school” was a teacher-training institution; at the time Clara attended, the program was designed to last two years. The increasingly codified teacher certification requirements being mandated around this period would have necessitated that Clara, along with many others, seek further educational opportunities such as those afforded by Muhlenberg’s Extension School.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Clara graduated from West Chester in 1920, and by 1923 was teaching in Atlantic City, NJ. She&nbsp;taught elementary school students at both the Pennsylvania and New Jersey Avenue Schools. She appears to have been teaching there when those schools were legally ordered to desegregate in the late 1920s. According to the <em>Morning Call</em>, she attended not only the 1927 Muhlenberg Summer School, but also the 1926 class. The 1930 census still lists her occupation as “teacher;” by this time she had married John R. Major, an Atlantic City mortician, and given birth to her first daughter, Beryl. A second daughter, LaVeida, followed in 1932.</p>



<p>According to a fragment of an obituary appearing in the<em> Morning Call, </em>Clara passed away in January, 1936, and was interred in Atlantic City. The cause of death is unknown, and further research in the microfilmed archives of Atlantic City newspapers is needed to learn more. Clara’s daughters went on to college, one graduating from West Virginia State University, an HBCU, and one attending Moravian College for one year. Both daughters appear to have spent time living with their grandmother in Bethlehem. After 1960, their names disappear from all readily-available sources.</p>



<p>We plan to continue to search for resources that shed light on Clara’s life, and perhaps someday help us locate her descendants. For now, we can assert that Clara Lane was Muhlenberg College’s first known black student.&nbsp;<br></p>

<p>During the 2018-2019 academic year, Sasha Cheer ‘19, a Media and Communication and Theatre double major, created a timeline around the history of theatre at Muhlenberg College. Sasha approached Susan Falciani Maldonado, Special Collections and Archives Librarian, in 2016 at a transcribing event that was held in the library. She spoke about being drawn to old things, about how sad it was that letter-writing was a dying art, and that she would be interested in learning more about what was held in the College’s archives. Eventually, as happens with archival internships, the right collection, student, and digital tool came together in the shape of a theatre timeline. Sasha began the project as an independent study to fulfill her theatre history requirement, under the supervision of Falciani Maldonado and Dr. Beth Schachter, Director of Women&#8217;s &amp; Gender Studies and Associate Professor of Theatre. The project grew beyond the scope of one semester, and Sasha diligently continued to work on it in her spare time through the rest of the academic year. </p>

<p>Sasha showed thoughtfulness when encountering problematic material in the archives: for example, she encountered a performance in 1931 featuring students wearing blackface. Sasha consulted with the archivist and with a faculty mentor about how best to represent this performance. She was very concerned about not obscuring the story, but did not want to reproduce the visual online. In the end, Sasha decided to openly discuss the problematic nature of the event, while providing references to the physical archival material.</p>



<p>We asked Sasha, who is about to embark on a year of teaching in Japan, to reflect on her experience working on the timeline, which can be <a href="http://trexler.muhlenberg.edu/library/specialcollections/digitalprojects/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">viewed</a> on the Special Collections section of the library website.</p>



<p><strong>What drew you to this project/ what made you approach the archivist?</strong></p>



<p>I would not call myself a history buff, but I love old things&#8211;there is an aesthetic to them that always holds the promise of a good story. I can&#8217;t recall how I met our archivist, Susan Falciani, but I do have distinct memories of coming to her and having conversations about the history of our buildings and [asking] &#8220;why do we have this here?&#8221; merely out of curiosity&#8217;s sake. Therefore, I was already well-acquainted with her when I decided to undertake this project. &#8220;Muhlenberg&#8221; has become synonymous with &#8220;Theatre,&#8221; as our program has gained more and more prestige. And yet, when I asked how we became so well-known for Theatre, the answer I always received was a shrug and &#8220;Charlie Richter.&#8221; Charlie has been around for about 40 years, which for a human lifetime is very long, but in the perspective of history, is a very short time. What was <em>before</em> Charlie Richter? No one in the Theatre Department seemed to have any answer for me. And as I learned over my years in both high-school and college, if no one knows, then the archivist will&#8211;and if the archivist doesn&#8217;t know, then they just haven&#8217;t gotten there yet. There are few things more tempting than discovering the answer to something no one has any idea about.</p>



<p><strong>Why do you think this work is important?</strong></p>



<p>Theatre is ephemeral. So much work, effort, blood, sweat, and tears are put into a few single spectacular moments that will be gone the instant the show is over, never to be repeated the same way ever again. It is performed for the here and now, for the community of living and breathing and feeling together. It is easy to neglect documenting the past of something that is only built for the moment. Our grip on future moments can be built stronger if we remember the story the moments of the past create.</p>



<p><strong>What was the most interesting thing that you learned/discovered?</strong></p>



<p>The people, for sure! It&#8217;s so hard to envision the names we come across in the newspapers and yearbooks as once living, breathing, working humans! Some of these people I came across had as great an effect on Muhlenberg&#8217;s campus and throughout Allentown as much as some folks in our current department have, and it was just wonderful to imagine them walking our halls, worried over grades, thinking about auditions, taking trips into New York, petitioning for more budget, promising one another that the next production will be great, and just working SO hard for performances no alive can now recall.</p>



<p><strong>What from this experience will you carry forward into your future?</strong></p>



<p>An archivist&#8217;s work is never done! There is so much I discovered that I was unable to include. The work emphasizes precision, and no college research paper ever required the research skill levels this project did&#8211;trying to track things down is like trying to find a needle in a haystack. It&#8217;s a whole skill-set in itself that I haven&#8217;t mastered yet&#8211;though (shout out to our current archivist, Susan) who can do it<em> beautifully</em>, like snapping her fingers!</p>



<p><strong>How did this play into your theatre major?</strong></p>



<p>The content of the timeline was Theatre oriented which got me thinking about history and the nature of performance, but the documentation of the timeline was more closely related to my Media &amp; Communications major, which had me think about appropriate presentation of facts, and non-biased engagement. Additionally, I did a curatorship of some of the archived material halfway through the year, which utilized a sort of Visual Arts approach to its arrangement and creation.<br></p>
