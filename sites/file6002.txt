			<p><em>With the spring sports season just about wrapped up, we will be taking a closer look at Muhlenberg’s senior student-athletes.</em></p>
<p><em>We conclude the senior profiles series with Part One of men’s and women’s track and field, which competed at the Centennial Conference Championships in early May.</em></p>

<p><strong>How did you get into pole vaulting? </strong>I wanted to try pole vaulting when I first started track my junior year of high school, because my dad was a pole vaulter when he was in high school. He actually held the pole vault record at my high school, and it wasn&#8217;t broken until I started track when my teammate broke it. My grandmother was also a pole vaulter when she was in high school too, so the event just ran in my family. The first day I tried it, I knew that that was the event I wanted to do.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your most memorable Muhlenberg track and field memory? </strong>One of my most memorable track memories was when I lucked out at the outdoor conference meet my freshman year. The weather was pretty bad the day we pole vaulted at F&amp;M, but we started to compete outdoors anyway. I didn&#8217;t have a very good day and got out pretty early on. But then they postponed the meet for a couple hours to try and wait out the storm. After a few hours went by, they decided to move the pole vault into their indoor facilities. So much time had passed since we had stopped pole vaulting that the decision was made to start the competition all over again. That time I advanced farther than I had when we were outdoors and actually tied for eighth place to earn the team a half point. I was really lucky that that happened.</p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans? </strong>For now I&#8217;m moving back home to work and save money to eventually go back to school. The plan right now is to go to grad school for school counseling, preferably in elementary education.</p>
<p><strong>What kind of person is Kimberlee Yalango? </strong>Well, for one thing she&#8217;s the reason I was on the track team here. We met each other the first weekend of our freshmen year and figured out that we were both thinking about being on the team but weren&#8217;t completely committed to it. We decided to try it out together, and now here we are years later. She&#8217;s been an amazing leader for our team, as well as an amazing friend to everyone. She&#8217;s been completely dedicated to the team all of our four years here, and that really shows on and off the track. It&#8217;s an understatement to say that the team will be sad to see her graduate. Kim is my teammate, bus buddy, roommate, best friend and a person that I honestly could not imagine my college experience without.</p>

<p><strong>How fulfilling was it winning your first Centennial Conference gold medal with the indoor 4&#215;800 relay this year? </strong>That was without a doubt the highlight of my track and field career because the 4&#215;800 has always been my favorite race. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever been happier to place in a conference meet, especially with the incredible relay team I was placed on. It was extremely fulfilling since the gold got snagged from us at the previous outdoor championships during my anchor leg, and I had never really forgiven myself for it. The gold in indoors was definitely redemption for all of us, and I&#8217;m so grateful I got to enjoy that moment with my teammates and end my career at conference meets on such a high note.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your most memorable Muhlenberg track and field memory? </strong>I think my most memorable track memory would be winning that 4&#215;800 relay or going to the last chance meet at the Armory my sophomore year with the &#8220;Candy Sisters&#8221; of Alex Faust, Jen Lynch and Nicolette Miller to run the distance medley relay. While we broke the school record in a race with only one other team, the laughs and bonding from that trip were my favorite part, and we still reminisce about it to this day. I&#8217;ll make note though that the DMR school record we broke that year got smashed this year by a relay team of extremely talented athletes that you can expect a lot more from in the upcoming years.</p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans? </strong>I am moving down to North Carolina and attending Wake Forest University in the fall for my Master&#8217;s in Counseling.</p>
<p><strong>What kind of person is Mellissa Miller? </strong>Melissa&#8217;s athletic career truly defines the type of person that she is. She has gone through more setbacks than anyone I know, including a case of mono, countless injuries, a semester abroad and, most recently, a torn hamstring. She has had to sit out many meets and seasons, and while most people in her shoes would probably just give up and quit the team, she never did. She is an extremely persistent athlete and individual, and she keeps a positive attitude and makes the most of every situation. I know the team will miss her sense of humor and feisty personality. Not only is she my only fellow senior on the team, but she&#8217;s also my best friend, my bus buddy, my biggest supporter and the reason I&#8217;ve enjoyed the past four years on the track team so incredibly much.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft" title="Michael Baer" src="http://www.muhlenberg.edu/images/main/athletics/men/trackandfield/hs/track11/baerhs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" />Michael Baer</strong></p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s the best part about being a multi-athlete? </strong>The variety. I&#8217;m always getting to work on something new and try something different. If one event isn&#8217;t going well I can channel my frustration into a different event.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s your most memorable Muhlenberg track and field memory? </strong>Scoring my first points as a sophomore in the high hurdles.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s your best off-the-track memory from your time here? </strong>The huge blizzard that shut down the school for two days during my sophomore year. That might have been the last snow day I&#8217;ll ever have&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans? </strong>I am attending the University of Pennsylvania medical school, but beyond that I&#8217;m not sure. I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised to find myself working as an oncologist in the future.</p>
<p><strong>What kind of person is David Kurtis? </strong>For the past couple of years, Dave has been one of the hardest-working people on the team and a great teammate to hurdle with. I think a lot of people on the team look up to Dave because of how hard he worked to improve in the intermediate hurdles, which paid off when he took home a bronze medal at the last conference meet. I&#8217;ll definitely miss questioning him on the utility of Dream Zoo.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft" title="Marc Brookland" src="http://www.muhlenberg.edu/images/main/athletics/men/trackandfield/hs/track11/brooklandhs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" />Marc Brookland</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do you have any superstitions or traditions you do before a big meet? </strong>I always put on and tie my left shoe before my right. I&#8217;ve done that since I started track in middle school.</p>
<p><strong>H</strong><strong>ow does it feel being the school record holder in both the indoor and outdoor triple jump? </strong>It&#8217;s really an honor. Both records were held for a long time and were pretty far distances. I&#8217;m proud to say I&#8217;m the school&#8217;s record holder in both.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your most memorable Muhlenberg track and field memory? </strong>My most memorable moment is a tie between breaking the outdoor record in triple jump and breaking 22 feet in long jump for the first time. They both meant a lot to me.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your best off-the-track memory from your time here? </strong>My best off-the-track memory at Muhlenberg was seeing Michael Ingridson live in concert in Memorial Hall.</p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans? </strong>I&#8217;m not sure right now. Hopefully I get into Drexel&#8217;s graduate program.</p>
<p><strong>What’s Michael Baer like as a captain? </strong>Baer is a great leader. He&#8217;s not that kind of guy who runs around like a cheerleader and tries to motivate his team vocally, but that&#8217;s because he doesn&#8217;t have to. He recognizes that actions speak louder than words, and his intensity and dedication on the track speaks for him. He leaves everything on the track day in and day out. We were lucky to have him lead us throughout the year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft" title="David Kurtis" src="http://www.muhlenberg.edu/images/main/athletics/men/trackandfield/hs/track11/kurtishs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" />David Kurtis</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do you have any hidden or unusual talents? </strong>I can chirp like a cricket.</p>
<p><strong>How did you become a hurdler? </strong>As a freshman in high school I wanted to find an event that I could be the best at on my team. Given that there were no other hurdlers at the time, I took advantage of the opportunity. It also afforded me the chance to spend every day at practice with three senior girls.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your most memorable Muhlenberg track and field memory? </strong>Placing 3rd in the 400 hurdles at the outdoor conference championship my senior year and setting a new personal best.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your best off-the-track memory from your time here? </strong>Seeing Michael Ingridson perform live in Memorial Hall with my buddy Marc Brookland.</p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans? </strong>I will be moving to Chicago after graduation to work for Allstate Insurance.</p>
<p><strong>What’s Marc Brookland like away from track? </strong>About as much fun as zip lining.</p>

<p>Mayden ran the 5,000 meters in 17:13.55 at the Bucknell Distance Night, breaking the previous school record by seven seconds.

			<p>It’s the middle of April – taxes are due, the Titanic has been down for 100 years, and even though softball and men&#8217;s lacrosse have the weekend off, there’s plenty of Muhlenberg sports action.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-104" title="Mule Marquee Matchup" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="237" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg 350w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1-300x203.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" /></a>Women’s Tennis vs. Washington (Friday, 3:30)</strong></p>
<p>Two teams that made the Centennial Conference playoffs last year are in a scramble to get back. Washington (5-3) and Muhlenberg (3-3) are in the middle of a five-team pack that includes Haverford (6-2), Dickinson (5-2) and Gettysburg (4-3). Those five teams are likely competing for three playoff spots, with Johns Hopkins and Swarthmore setting the pace at 6-0.</p>
<p>The Shorewomen are ranked eighth in the Atlantic South Region but have struggled since losing two of their top four players to injuries. Muhlenberg is coming off its most decisive win of the season, 8-1 against Ursinus.</p>
<p>Washington has won the last four meetings, including one in the 2009 CC playoffs. Last year’s 7-2 match featured many close sets.</p>
<p><strong>Tennis vs. Johns Hopkins (Saturday, 1:00); at McDaniel (Sunday, 12:00)</strong></p>
<p>A busy weekend of tennis for the Mules includes teams at opposite ends of the CC standings. For the women, Johns Hopkins is 6-0 in the CC and ranked eighth in Division III; McDaniel is 0-8 in the CC. For the men, 16th-ranked Hopkins is 6-0 and McDaniel is 0-5. The Muhlenberg men have not lost to McDaniel since 1982.</p>
<p><strong>Baseball vs. Swarthmore (Friday, 3:30); at Gettysburg (Saturday, 12:30 doubleheader)</strong></p>
<p>The Mules will try to halt their five-game skid at home against Swarthmore. Muhlenberg has not lost at home to the Garnet since 1995, extending the streak last year on a walkoff home run. The Mules then travel to Gettysburg, whom they swept last year.</p>

<p><strong>Women’s Lacrosse vs. Bryn Mawr (Saturday, 1:00)</strong></p>
<p>After three straight one-goal losses, the Mules are looking to take out their frustrations against a Bryn Mawr team that has not won a CC game since 2000.</p>

<p>In preparation for the three-day CC Championships coming up in two weeks, the Mules will test their stamina by playing on four straight days.</p>

<p>Softball and track and field take the spotlight this weekend.</p>
<p><strong>Softball at McDaniel (Saturday, 1:00)</strong></p>
<p>What makes this the marquee matchup of the weekend? It&#8217;s not just that McDaniel is in first place in the Centennial Conference with an 8-0 record <a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-104" title="Mule Marquee Matchup" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1-300x203.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="203" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1-300x203.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>and Muhlenberg is one of two teams tied for second at 6-2 &#8211; although that certainly is a big part of it.</p>
<p>The two teams have come by their success in extremely different manners. Muhlenberg is hitting .374 and averaging more than nine runs in its eight CC games. Reigning CC player of the week Kelly Kline is hitting .593 with a .963 slugging percentage in CC games .</p>
<p>McDaniel, on the other hand, has done it with pitching, allowing only eight runs in its eight CC games. Reigning CC pitcher of the week Caroline Brehm is 8-0 with a 0.46 ERA and 88 strikeouts in 45.1 innings in CC games.</p>
<p>What will win out, hitting or pitching?</p>

<p><strong>Track &amp; Field hosts Muhlenberg Invitational (Saturday, 10:00)</strong></p>
<p>The Mules welcome 15 other schools for their only home meet of the outdoor season. This meet has been contested in rain and snow in previous years, so the sunshine and mild temperatures should lead to some good performances. Muhlenberg is also sending a handful of runners to Princeton for a distance event Friday night.</p>
<p><strong>Women&#8217;s Lacrosse at McDaniel (Friday, 3:30); Men&#8217;s Lacrosse at McDaniel (Saturday, 1:00)</strong></p>
<p>The Mule lax teams travel to Westminster in search of their first Centennial Conference win of the season. Both teams defeated McDaniel last year, the women 17-6 and the men 8-5. Both Green Terror squads have won just once in the CC.</p>

<p><strong>Baseball at Franklin &amp; Marshall (Saturday, 12:30 doubleheader)</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg has lost four of its last five CC games and will look to get back on the winning track against a Franklin &amp; Marshall team that has split its first three CC series. Four of the Diplomats&#8217; first six CC games ended in shutouts, two each way.</p>

Hopefully, the forecasted rain will not turn this busy schedule into an April Fool.</p>
<p><strong>Softball vs. Washington (Saturday, 1:00); at Gettysburg (Sunday, 1:00)</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-104" title="Mule Marquee Matchup" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1-300x203.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="203" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1-300x203.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Two Centennial Conference playoff teams square off on Saturday in the Mules&#8217; first home CC doubleheader of the 2012 season. Muhlenberg beat Washington, 8-4, in the first game of the playoffs en route to the CC championship last year. The teams split in the regular season. The Shorewomen are off to a 4-0 start in CC play, while the Mules are 2-0.</p>

<p>Live stats Game 2: <a href="http://www.muhlenberg.edu">http://www.muhlenberg.edu/sports/softlive2/xlive.htm</a></p>
<p>Gettysburg did not make the CC playoffs last year but is traditionally one of the strongest teams in the league, and one that gives Muhlenberg a hard time. The Mules have never swept the Bullets in a regular-season doubleheader, and they haven&#8217;t won a game at Gettysburg since 2000.</p>

<p><strong>Baseball vs. Ursinus (Friday, 3:30); at McDaniel (Saturday, 12:30 doubleheader); at Centenary (Sunday, 12:00)</strong></p>
<p>The 16-6 Mules, who received 11 votes in this week&#8217;s D3baseball.com poll, look to continue their winning ways with three CC games and one non-league contest. Coming off Tuesday&#8217;s 11-5 win at Ursinus, Muhlenberg will try to complete its first season sweep of the Bears on Friday.</p>

<p>Saturday&#8217;s twinbill is against a McDaniel team that, like Muhlenberg, has shown great improvement: The Green Terror is 11-4 after winning 12 games all of last season. The Mules, who have scored in double figures in 13 of their 22 games, will try to solve a McDaniel pitching staff that has a sparkling 2.40 ERA.</p>

<p>After evening their CC mark at 2-2 with a dramatic win vs. Franklin &amp; Marshall last night, the Mule women look to make it two in a row against a Washington team that reached the CC championship match last year. The Mule men are looking for their first win of the spring.</p>
<p><strong>Men&#8217;s Golf at McDaniel Spring Invitational (Saturday and Sunday)</strong></p>
<p>The Mules compete in one of their biggest tournaments of the season, with 18 teams scheduled to tee off in the two-day event. Among their opponents will be five other CC teams.</p>

<p>The Mules peaked at the right time, beating Franklin &amp; Marshall and Johns Hopkins to capture their record seventh Centennial Conference championship (no other program has more than four). It’s the second straight year Muhlenberg avenged a pair of regular-season loses by beating Hopkins in the title game on its home court. The Mules have won five of the last seven CC titles and are the first team in any sport in school history to advance to five straight NCAA Tournaments.</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft" title="Peter Rice" src="http://www.muhlenberg.edu/images/main/athletics/men/trackandfield/hs/track11/ricehs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" />Male Athlete of the Week – Peter Rice, Track and Field</strong></p>
<p>Rice went 4-for-4 at the Centennial Conference Indoor Championships to pick up his third straight Most Outstanding Performer Award for track events (2 indoor, 1 outdoor). He ran the anchor leg on the 4&#215;200-meter relay team that broke the school and conference championship meet records and set another meet mark in the 400. Rice missed the championship record by .01 seconds to win the 200 and closed out his perfect day with a gold in the 4&#215;400-meter relay. His 16 career gold medals are the most in school history.</p>

This weekend, they get their final tuneups.</p>
<p><strong>Men’s Basketball at Ursinus (Saturday, 3:00)</strong></p>
<p>In the CC preseason poll, Franklin &amp; Marshall was picked to finish first, Muhlenberg second and Dickinson third. And even though Dickinson started out 2-4, and Muhlenberg was 4-6 just four weeks ago, that’s exactly the way things could wind up.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-104" title="Mule Marquee Matchup" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1-300x203.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="203" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1-300x203.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>If the Mules (16-8, 10-7) beat the Bears (9-15, 8-9 and out of playoff contention), and Dickinson loses to Franklin &amp; Marshall, Muhlenberg will earn the No. 2 seed and face Dickinson in a CC semifinal next Saturday. If Muhlenberg and Dickinson both win, they will play each other with the Red Devils as the No. 2 seed.</p>
<p>With a loss, the Mules slip to the No. 4 seed, and they would host the loser of the Johns Hopkins-Washington game on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The first pair of Muhlenberg teammates to each score 400 points in a season in 16 years, senior Spencer Liddic and freshman Malique Killing are approaching milestones. Liddic is 22 rebounds away from 1,000, and Killing needs 20 points to break the school freshman record of 419 set by Bob McClure in 1967-68.</p>
<p>Ursinus won the first meeting, 63-61, overcoming a 14-point deficit with 14 minutes to play. The Bears have won the last three regular-season meetings in Collegeville, two in overtime and the other by one point.</p>

<p><strong>Women’s Basketball at Ursinus (Saturday, 1:00)</strong></p>
<p>The Mules are locked into a semifinal playoff game against Franklin &amp; Marshall. They can earn the No. 2  seed with a win and the right combination of other results, but all that impacts is what color jersey they’ll wear in their first playoff game.</p>
<p>There are some team and individual milestones on the horizon. Muhlenberg (19-5, 14-5) will reach the 20-win plateau for the fifth straight year by beating Ursinus. In the College’s athletic history, the only team to post five consecutive 20-win seasons was volleyball (1991-95).</p>
<p>Senior Alexandra Chili, who on Wednesday broke the school record for field goals made by a basketball player (male or female), is within 57 points of the CC career record of 1,965. She hit game-winning last-second shots in two of the three games she’s played at Ursinus.</p>
<p>Ursinus (13-11, 12-7) has clinched a playoff berth but needs a win to secure a first-round home game. The Mules won the first meeting, 72-55, but the Bears are a different team at home, where they are 8-1.</p>

<p><strong>Track &amp; Field at Keogh Invitational (Friday, 5:00)</strong></p>
<p>The Mule teams will try to get a few more athletes qualified for the CC Championships at the site of last year’s conference meet.</p>
<p><strong>Wrestling at Scranton with Johns Hopkins (Saturday, noon)</strong></p>
<p>The wrestlers complete their pre-championship circuit of CC opponents. The Mules are 15-12 in contested matches against CC foes.</p>
