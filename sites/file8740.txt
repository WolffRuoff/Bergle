								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the peer-reviewed article,<em> Social Networking Sites in Romantic Relationships: Attachment, Uncertainty, and Partner Surveillance on Facebook</em>, scholars address how social media sites, particularly Facebook, affect romantic relationships both on- and offline. By accepting a person’s friend request, that person can access your photos, videos, status updates, list of friends, background information, and overall history on the site. Additionally, a friend can post statuses on your profile, message you privately, and also identify a relationship status between the two of you. It is extremely easy to create a Facebook page and with a click of a button, a person can readily access yours and others’ personal information.</p>
<p>Considering there is a large population of Facebook users who post and share their relationship status, many couples are affected by the world of social media. Statistics say that Facebook activities contribute to nearly 20% of divorce cases. “Within romantic relationships, it is common for individuals to stay apprised of the happenings in their partners’ lives. Communication within the couple, an interactive strategy, is the most straightforward way to garner this information, but it is common for partners to employ other information-seeking strategies to learn about their target (the other partner)” (Fox, 2014, p.3). For example, just as a girlfriend can watch from a distance how their boyfriend behaves around others, that girlfriend can just as easily gather information on her boyfriend through pictures he may post, conversations he may have, and pictures that he has liked or commented on. People who struggle with trust issues and jealousy tend to be the people who are most likely to “stalk” not only their partner’s profiles, but also profiles their partner is friends with. Through this kind of online surveillance, many couples either feel more secure in their relationship or more frequently, undergo serious complications.</p>
<p>Two main theories that tend to fuel online relationship “stalking” are the theory of relational uncertainty and the theory of attachment, which scholars, Fox and Warber, delve deeply into. “If a partner is unsure about the target’s feelings or intentions&#8230;the partner experiencing uncertainty may explore the content of the target’s profile to determine what the target is doing and who they are interacting with so that the partner can alleviate uncertainty about the relationship” (Fox, 2014, p.4). Not only is uncertainty problematic throughout the duration of the relationship, but it lingers after the breakup as well. Even if a couple physically separates, they are likely to still remain “friends” on Facebook. “This lingering connection—as well as access to the ex-partner’s post-breakup experiences via Facebook posts and pictures—may foster feelings of uncertainty about the relationship after dissolution”(Fox, 2014, p.4). Some partners may interpret this “connection” as hope that they may one day rekindle what they once had. This kind of person is likely to continuously monitor their ex-partner’s profile for clues about the ex’s relational ambitions and intentions. The theory of attachment is similar in that it revolves around a sense of anxiety. Scholars say that there are four distinct attachment styles, which include secure, preoccupied, dismissing, and fearful individuals. All of these qualities directly affect how a partner reacts to their significant other’s profile and how deeply they will investigate that profile.</p>
<p>While social networking sites have the potential to degrade relationship satisfaction, they can also keep a couple’s relationship alive, especially in cases of long-distance relationships. Platforms like Skype, FaceTime, Snapchat, and Google Chat allow partners to talk face to face, which can really enhance communication and a sense of connection between partners. Other sites like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter create outlets for couples to post pictures and videos together and write messages to one another. Furthermore, making a relationship “Facebook official” can send a message to others that you are in a committed relationship and can prevent others from romantically approaching both you and your partner.</p>
<p>Overall, its important to use social networking sites carefully when involved in a relationship. “The significance and potential effects of monitoring current and former romantic partners on Facebook”(Fox, 2014, p.6) has revolutionized the way people create and maintain relationships. While many couples have let social media negatively impact their relationship, some have found that it facilitates communication and support. If Facebook is creating conflict in your relationship, there is one easy solution and that is to reduce usage.</p>
