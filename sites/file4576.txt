								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Lisa Siciliano &#8217;10 blogs about her summer internship.</em></p>
<p><em></em><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-143" src="http://mediacom.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2009/10/mtv_logo_by_h4v0c.jpg" alt="mtv_logo_by_h4v0c" width="180" height="180" srcset="http://mediacom.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2009/10/mtv_logo_by_h4v0c.jpg 300w, http://mediacom.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2009/10/mtv_logo_by_h4v0c-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 180px) 100vw, 180px" />How did I get an internship at MTV Networks?  I’m not 100% sure, but I would credit it to a strong resume and skill set as well as good luck and good timing.  Along with getting all A’s, choreographing a dance, and trying to live the college life, obtaining a summer internship was one of my greatest goals of the Spring 2008 semester.  After researching programs during my winter break, shadowing a Muhlenberg Alum at NBC, and fine tuning my resume and cover letter with help from The Career Center, I applied to MTV, ABC, and NBC.  I started receiving e-mails from MTV&#8217;s Human Resources Department and had various phone interviews with my future boss. By the end of finals, I was officially an MTV Networks Intern.  I worked for the Digital Encoding Services, and though I had no idea what I was in for, I was excited.</p>
<p>Digital Encoding Services is located on the tenth floor of MTV Networks, right in the middle of Times Square.  Its main objective is to prepare files to be sent to various “Download to Own” clients such as I-Tunes, X-Box, Amazon.com, Hulu, and more.  The episodes you watch of your favorite MTV shows on I-Tunes are put together by us!  DES also works with On-Demand programming for a variety of networks.  MTV Networks is not just MTV, but Spike, Comedy Central, Nickelodeon, Noggin, The N, VH1, MTV 2, and more.  One of the newer projects I worked on was preparing for the premiere of the new EPIX on demand movie channel for August.</p>
<p>My day to day duties included a variety of somewhat challenging projects.  I put my editing skills to use and edited files with Final Cut Pro—taking out the black commercial slugs.  I learned how to transcode, or crop files for certain specifications.  I encoded a variety of files, putting them on the computer from the tape to make sendable files.  I watched hours of television shows from “Dora the Explorer” to “Trucks” to “My Super Sweet Sixteen,” looking for any video or audio errors that would interrupt the file quality.  I even was a test audience member for the new show, “It’s On With Alexa Chung!”  I learned something new every day.</p>
<p>My internship at MTV Networks allowed me to put the theories and skills I have learned in Muhlenberg classes to use and it opened my eyes to how different the corporate world is from the classroom.  This internship reaffirmed that television production is something that I definitely want to pursue for at least part of my adult life.  Thankfully, I know that I can take the great experiences and the same determination and persistence that I used to get the internship to allow me to be successful in my life after Muhlenberg.</p>
