					<description><![CDATA[Very interesting article, Group 4 - It brings into focus the role that outside groups (such as parents groups and child advocacy organizations) play in pressuring media producers to change their content.  Your article also touches on another still more powerful pressure point - advertisers (client power role).  The loss of advertising revenue is likely to keep this program from being on MTV&#039;s schedule for very long.  Often, advocacy groups (public advocacy power role) will pressure both media producers and advertisers to try to bring about changes in media content.  Good article selection here - just a bit more on how this reflects the power roles in action would have made your analysis even better.  There was also one small APA formatting error in your reference (only need author&#039;s first initial, and that&#039;s all).  Looking forward to your future posts...Onwards!]]></description>
