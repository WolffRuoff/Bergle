								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My summer went from 0 to 100,<em> real quick.Â </em></p>
<p>I have my internship, my job, the occasional tour guiding, and then I just got offered an amazing opportunity to take part in the Summer Business Institute (SBI) on campus. I have always wanted to take a class in the Business Department because I continuously hear amazing things about it. Unfortunately, because of my schedule for the next year and my desireÂ to get all my classes for my major and double minor in on time so I can graduate with my class year, I will be unable to. This summer, I just won&#8217;tÂ have enough time to do my job, work for my internship AND add the SBI on top of all that.Â Knowing this is a chance to do something I&#8217;ve always wanted and then realizing that I can&#8217;t stretch myself out too thing makes me so sad.</p>
<p>Maybe I&#8217;ll be ableÂ to take a few business classes after I graduate. Maybe I&#8217;ll go back to school to get a Business degree. Who knows? I&#8217;ve always been interested in it, so there has to be more opportunities out there for me&#8230;</p>
<p>Until next time,</p>
<p>Felisa</p>
