								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have we really reached a world that we might have to start using social Media to enhance our learning? Technology has already changed the way kids are learning so I couldn’t imagine kids using social media to learn. Using social media to learn would be very hard to do because kids most likely do not even focus on the work they would be reading up on their news feeds and talking to friends, but in the same senses I feel that kids would absorb information if it was laid out in social media. If your class was set up as a twitter feed I’m sure many kids would have such an easy time navigating through the work. It would be very interesting to see someone try to set a class up like that, or even if it was set up as Facebook.</p>
<p>But social media can be used in many other different ways for learning. Like in the article “Twitter for teaching: Can social media be used to enhance the process of learning?” Chris Evans does research to see if Twitter helps enhances the process of learning, but he uses students who have never used twitter before. It is interesting to see students who haven’t used twitter before become introduced to it in an educational way.</p>
<p>Evans has the students interact with their tutor over twitter using hashtags so that it is easy for the tutors to be able to go and look at what each student is asking. Evans asks in his research if this replaces kids being able to go to class, which he showed that it doesn’t cause even though the students question or concern might be answered, it can never replace the act of walking in to a class and sitting down for a lecture. Social media can never replace the act of going in to a classroom and having a face to face interaction with a teacher or professor.</p>
<p>Evans studied many different aspects of twitter and educations and he figured out that yes it did help students get more evolved and engage in what they were learning. But you will never be able to replace the classroom, social media will be able to help enhance learning. But I don’t think it will ever replace it.</p>
<p>This is something that as my generation gets older should start paying attention to because there might be a day where our kids don’t even go and sit in a class room. They will be learning everything online. They might not even know what a text book is because they will most likely be caring around a tablet or some technological devices that holds all their information that they need.</p>
<p>Our parents telling us how they remember a day without all this technology, we will be saying to our kids how we remember the days of text books and sitting in classrooms. At some point though I think someone will need to step in and make sure that the idea of sitting in a class room remains that way. Because we don’t want future generations not learning how to socialize in person and not getting those learning experiences that we get.</p>
<p>The movement of technology needs to start slowing down and we need to start looking at how much time we spend already looking at a screen. Its unhealthy and the last thing I would want is to be taking classes all online and using social media to help.</p>
