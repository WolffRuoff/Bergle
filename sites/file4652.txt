								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>That was quick. All of the sudden my sophomore year is done and I am sitting at home just trying to figure out where the time went.</p>
<p>Part of it might be a result of how crazy finals week was (I am almost positive I did enough work to fill an entire course load for a semester in one week but we won&#8217;t get into that).</p>
<p>A lot happened this year. I saw a lot, I learned a lot, and I made a lot of great friends along the way. It&#8217;ll be tough being away from my friends, teachers, coaches, and kids in the Fall, but I know how great of an opportunity I have in front of me is and I look forward to making the most of it before coming back with a renewed appreciation for school.</p>
<p>To all of my friends I leave behind &#8211; I love ya, have a great semester, and I will be sure to catch you all up when I get back!</p>
<p>To the seniors &#8211; congrats on graduating and be sure to stay in touch! You guys should be so proud of what you&#8217;ve accomplished!</p>
<p>I look forward to next year and sharing more stories with you guys but until then&#8230;</p>
<p>Happy Mother&#8217;s Day</p>
<p>Happy Senior Week</p>
<p>and Happy Birthday!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This past Friday I woke up before 6am. Not to finish work or study for exams. No. I was up at 5:45am to begin setting up the Life Sports Center for the annual Jefferson Field Day. It would be another 3 hours before any volunteers showed up and another hour after that when all the kids from Jefferson Elementary School would arrive. Yes, ALL the kids &#8211; from Kindergarden to 6th grade &#8211; were packed into the field house and the gymnasium for a day full of games.</p>
<p>Easily the best day of the year, it was great to see it from the side of the committee this year, and it was a very accomplished feeling I had when we began to clean up after the hugely successful day.</p>
<p>I got to work as a classroom leader with the 1st graders that I work for through America Reads and we had such a blast, from cheering on our classmates to participating in the events, and all 19 of them did so well!</p>
<p>Here are some pictures from the day:</p>

<p>Such a great day! I cannot wait until next year &#8211; or even better &#8211; until finals are over and summer is here!</p>
<p>Happy birthday!</p>
