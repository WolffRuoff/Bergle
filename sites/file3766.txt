Retrieved from <a href="http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/industry/digital-and-mobile/new-grammy-rules-finally-acknowledge-videogame-1005127322.story">http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/industry/digital-and-mobile/new-grammy-rules-finally-acknowledge-videogame-1005127322.story</a></p>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://echoesblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/grammy-logo-gold.jpg" alt="" width="140" height="178" />In a long-overdue decision, the <a href="http://www.grammy.org/recording-academy">Recording Academy</a> recently announced that it would consider video game music for <a href="http://www.grammy.com/">Grammy Awards</a>. Although video games won’t have their own category (yet), they’ll be included in a general category encompassing “Music for Visual Media.” Nobody in the general public cares about this, of course, but the interesting question is whether they should.</p>
<p><span id="more-1109"></span></p>
<p>It’s tempting to compare the Grammy Awards to MTV—sad stories of once-powerful facilitators that got an ear-boxing from cable and the Internet—but the power of the Grammy Awards to effectively promote music even during the network era is questionable. The event has always been a self-congratulatory party for an inside group of music industry people, and during a time when media choices were more limited, the public mainly just enjoyed basking in the pomp and circumstance of the networks’ glitzy coverage. In fact, a better analogy for the Grammys would be to an Independence Day parade, a once-family friendly event today attended mostly by old war vets as the younger crowd plugs into yet another interactive media platform.</p>
<p>The reality, however, is that the Grammy Awards aren&#8217;t really trying to facilitate interaction with that increasingly disinterested TV-viewing public. It’s aimed at those industry insiders, and that’s what makes the inclusion of video game music into the award categories so important. The Recording Academy may not have much direct power over audiences, but by facilitating interactions between industry creators and producers, it helps to determine what those audiences eventually hear online, in stores, and on the radio. Now it may help to determine what video gamers, probably the least likely subgroup of Americans to care about the Grammys, hear when they log into <em><a href="http://us.battle.net/wow/en/">World of Warcraft</a></em>.</p>
<p>The new rules formalize linking pin activities between the record companies and the video game industry that have been growing with the video game industry itself. Popular titles like <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> routinely license popular rock and heavy-metal songs that fit well within their violent and iconoclastic gaming environment. Now, as new game consoles like Wii <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/tech/gaming/2007-05-24-wii_N.htm">offer games for a wide variety of audience categories</a>—fitness games for kids and older adults, chess games for math prodigies—that expand video games far beyond their traditional teenage-male cult, the record companies are starting to work with the gaming companies to exploit all the new distribution and exhibition possibilities.</p>
<p>Why wouldn’t Sony, for example, create music just for a new video game aimed at a particular age group or gender? These days, online and console games probably have a larger audience than MTV or VH1, and they have the ability to reach at least as specialized an audience as a cable television network. Cross-platform releases that include video games, radio, and television will probably become increasingly common. It probably won’t be long before the major media conglomerates own most of the video game production firms as they seek to streamline production, distribution, and exhibition of music and other mass media materials.</p>
<p>Public advocates within the music and video game industries have wanted the Grammys to recognize video game music for years, especially since some Grammy-winning songs that eventually enjoyed popular release originated within video games. Traditional video gamers, however, should be very afraid. This is exactly what happened when <a href="http://www.viacom.com/Pages/default.aspx">Viacom</a> invaded MTV, and we all saw the results. Now that the Recording Academy is sticking its fingers into video games, the core teenage-male cult may start to witness even more commercialization and homogenization of the music in their once-underground medium. Video game music creators, once somewhat separate from the mainstream music industry and free to experiment in a way unknown at most of the modern corporate record labels, may now be pressured to tow the labels’ line.</p>
<p>Only time will tell how the relationship between the labels and the video game companies will develop. However, if the conglomerates’ past record with new media is any indication, the idiosyncratic array of music in many video games today may soon become an artifact of history.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bruno, A. (16 March 2011). MTV launches Hive website, latest effort to refocus on music. <em>Billboard</em>. Retrieved from <a href="http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/industry/digital-and-mobile/mtv-launches-hive-website-latest-effort-1005075732.story#">http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/industry/digital-and-mobile/mtv-launches-hive-website-latest-effort-1005075732.story#</a></p>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/photos/stylus/1037809-MTV-Hive.png" alt="" width="200" height="140" />The empty acronym formerly known as Music Television (MTV) debuted a new website this week that focuses on…music. The new site, called “<a href="http://www.mtvhive.com/">Hive</a>,” will feature music videos, interviews, book reviews by artists, polls, music popularity tracking meters, and editorials by the company’s top executives. It appears to represent an effort by MTV to reinvent its image after recent Reality- show scandals, including a child pornography investigation surrounding its shock-schlock show <em>Skins</em>.</p>
<p><span id="more-955"></span></p>
<p>MTV wasn’t always a Reality TV depot. At its peak, MTV was one of the most important exhibitors in the music industry. Eighties and nineties kids often heard new music for the first time on the network’s popular request shows, and MTV’s decision to promote or marginalize a new artist could make or break a recording company’s profits for an entire year. The network also transformed the music video into a form of mass media, forcing the labels to dump millions of dollars a year into producing high-quality and catchy videos for audiences.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, over a decade after jumping onto the Reality TV bandwagon, MTV apparently wants to recapture some of its former image (and power). The network will exhibit music on the site, with a section for users to access new and vintage music videos and buy MP3s. Alongside the actual music will be polls that track users’ opinions of new artists, videos that feature <a href="http://www.mtvhive.com/playlists/76BA27020227BA7600010227BA76/mgid:playlist:video:mtvmusic.com:71585">sometimes bizarre</a> consumer reviews of music videos, and a feature called <a href="http://www.mtvmusicmeter.com/">Music Meter</a>, which claims to track an artists’ popularity on social media and downloading sites. MTV’s many Top Ten countdowns and on-air VJ reviews made it a facilitator for the music industry since its inception, and network executives are clearly hoping to carry that role online. To help with the transition, the network is bringing in veteran music industry linking pin Jessica Robertson, who helped <em><a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/">Rolling Stone</a> </em>and <em><a href="http://www.spinner.com/">Spinner</a></em> digitize and re-format their content for the Internet age.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In some ways, it’s surprising that MTV waited so long to overhaul its website. This is the network that has exploited almost every synergistic media connection possible, from television series to a movie division. Now that MTV is finally ready to “flex some music muscles,” as network president Van Toffler says, it may already be too late. MTV’s core demographic, the teen to twenties group, has been getting MP3s and music news online from sources that look suspiciously like MTV’s new website, including <a href="http://www.billboard.com/#/">Billboard</a>, for over a decade. Hive will have to include some outstanding features to draw users away from their established online music outlets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One notable feature of the site is the complete lack of traditional “advertising.” Of course, that’s largely because the site is one big advertisement for all artists whose labels have made deals with MTV to sell merchandise, concert tickets, and MP3s on the site, along with other promotion deals. In fact, the same criticisms that the network faced at its peak are likely to carry over to the new website. For years, critics argued that MTV was the prime homogenization force in the music industry, squeezing out smaller artists whose indie labels couldn’t pay to make high-profile deals with the network. It’s not hard to imagine that any concert tickets or merchandise sold on Hive won’t be for your local neighborhood ska band’s next gig. It’s not really that MTV doesn’t like indie artists. MTV has a bottom line to worry about, and music and promotion deals with Sony and EMI are more likely to increase it than smaller labels.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, it’s not really MTV doing all these things at all. MTV is actually owned by <a href="http://www.viacom.com/Pages/default.aspx">Viacom</a>, a massive media conglomerate that owns a number of television channels (including Nickelodeon) and a diversified portfolio of other media holdings. Viacom is interested in promoting the same content across multiple channels and making deals with reliable companies who they know will follow through on their commitments. Large national corporations don’t necessarily have time to deal with the eccentric smaller indie labels. MTV probably initially jumped into bed with Viacom because it couldn’t afford to do that, either. Like most things, it all comes down to money.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MTV apparently hopes to offer more local music listings and services in the future, but there’s no trace of those features on Hive. As the Internet becomes the primary exhibition and distribution outlet for music, corporations like MTV that specialize in music may eventually have to “own the local” in much the same way newspapers and radio stations had to with the advent of television. It’s too early to tell whether Hive will allow MTV to re-enter some of its former power roles in the music industry. Given Viacom’s financial backing, however, the network certainly has a fighting chance.</p>

<p>Albiniak.P.(2011,February 14). Spencer, Levy to Head MTV&#8217;s Scripted Development.<em>Broadcasting &amp; Cable</em>. Retrieved from <a href="http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/463937-Spencer_Levy_to_Head_MTV_s_Scripted_Development.php" target="_blank">http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/463937-Spencer_Levy_to_Head_MTV_s_Scripted_Development.php</a></p>
<p>MTV’s scripted series recently appointed new leadership. The Network’s president or Programming David Janollari named Clay Spencer and Justin Levy the new heads. Janollari said that their combined experience makes them the perfect team to work together. Levy has worked on MTV scripted series before while Spencer is new to the network. Spencer’s diverse television career has had a successful track record; working on networks like The WB and an independent production company. Janollari and him have worked together before. Just like in the publishing world MTV is sticking to who has been successful. In demanding times for television it would not be wise to hire some brand new writer no one has heard of even if he or she looks to have good work. Janollari is hiring who he knows and who he thinks he can get good results from.</p>
<p><span id="more-900"></span></p>
<p>With MTV’s recent scandal in regards to their highly controversial series <em>Skins</em>, maybe it was time to get new management in the scripted sector of this network. Levy has already proven successful during his previous time and an MTV executive where he “spearheaded such scripted efforts as <em>The Hard Times of RJ Berger, Teen Wolf</em>, and <em>This is Awkward.” </em>Prior to MTV Levy worked as a director of NBC’s primetime series development. Working for NBC is a good credential to have under your belt and MTV recognized that.By filling the creator power role of their organization with an experienced writer, they not only help create a better product, but at the same allocate more power to Levy than they would with a lesser known producer.With the network’s new leaders for their scripted series maybe MTV’s scripted shows will be able to beat out the great rating of their reality shows like <em>Jersey Shore</em> for example. The power of using what you already know to be good cannot be underestimated.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lafayette, J.  (2011, February 1). MTV’s ‘Skins’ Continues Ratings Slide Except with Teens.  <em>Broadcasting &amp; Cable</em>. Retrieved from <a href="http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/463300-MTV_s_Skins_Continues_Ratings_Slide_Except_with_Teens.php">http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/463300-MTV_s_Skins_Continues_Ratings_Slide_Except_with_Teens.php</a>.</p>
<p>The new MTV show <em><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=skins+us+trailer&amp;aq=f">Skins</a>,</em> a program that depicts (quite explicitly) “the sex and drug habits of teens,” is already facing pressure from audiences and advertisers, even though the show has only aired three episodes.  Although MTV aims its programming towards the 12-34 year old demographic, <em>Skins</em> has been wildly popular with 12-17 year olds (omg!), which is troubling for many parents.  One major media advocacy organization, The Parents Television Council, labeled <em>Skins</em> the “’&#8217;most dangerous show&#8217; on TV for children.&#8221;  Even Viacom, which owns MTV, has acknowledged these concerns, suggesting the show may, in fact, violate child pornography laws.  This negative attention has also worried advertisers, many of whom have opted to remove their advertisements from MTV during <em>Skins&#8217; </em>time slot.</p>
<p><span id="more-731"></span>The outcry over <em>Skins</em> complicates that old media adage that sex sells.  <em>Skins</em>’ racy content has upset public advocacy groups, which have significant power to shape television programming.  While we often think of government regulation as the key way to address questionable media content, this example suggests that public advocacy organizations can also be effective by encouraging media producers to self-regulate.  As a public advocacy group, the PTC has the ability to draw negative attention to <em>Skins</em>, increasing the likelihood that other parents will think twice before allowing their own kids to watch the program.  Plus, networks know that if they fail to listen to advocacy groups&#8217; concerns, these groups can turn to the government to secure mandated content regulation.   These two resources, publicity and the threat of government-regulation, give advocacy groups like the PTC an edge when dealing with media producers like MTV, and could very well persuade MTV to dial back on <em>Skins</em>&#8216; adult content.</p>
<p>In addition to the PTC, many advertisers have also objected to<em> Skins</em>.  Not wanting to be associated with an increasingly stigmatized show, General Motors, Taco Bell, Schick, Subway, Wrigley, and H&amp;R Block have all removed their ads during <em>Skins</em>’ time slot.  Other sponsors who had secured product placement deals with MTV, including Clearasil, are also considering withdrawing their involvement with <em>Skins. </em>So, advertisers, which fill the power role of client, can also use their resources to motivate television networks to self-regulate their content.   When a client like Subway withdraws its ads from MTV during <em>Skins</em>&#8216; time slot, this is an example of a client exercising its power, or strategically withholding its resources.  As television networks rely on money from advertisers, MTV, again, has an interest in self-regulating its controversial material in order to hold onto advertisers and the money that they control.</p>
<p>Whether you think the uproar over <em>Skins</em> represents a move towards a sensible solution or senseless censorship, one thing’s for sure: the <strong>ombudspeople</strong> at MTV must be very busy.</p>
