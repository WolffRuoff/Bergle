								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi, everyone!</p>
<p>My name is Rebecca, and I am a junior here at Muhlenberg. I am a biochemistry major and an economics minor. I applied Early Decision to Muhlenberg, and I still maintain that choosing to spend four years at &#8216;Berg was the best decision I have ever made. I am so excited to blog about life on campus!</p>
<p>This past week has been an amazing conglomeration of projects, activities, and events&#8211; in other words, a pretty typical week at Muhlenberg! It started with a really successful One Billion Rising Event that the Muhlenberg College Feminist Collective (of which I am a member) planned in conjunction with the international movement activist Eve Ensler started a year ago. On February 14, hundreds of thousands of men, women, and children in over 200 countries around the world sang, spoke, and danced in solidarity of a global commitment to ending sexual and domestic violence and promoting a worldwide atmosphere of love and safety for all its inhabitants. We spoke, read poetry, and danced in the middle of Seegers Union on Campus&#8211; it felt incredible to be a part of a movement that was so much bigger than anything any of us couldÂ  have comprehended, and to have received so much support from the campus community! Here&#8217;s an awesome picture of some of the people who &#8220;rose:&#8221;</p>

<p>The awesomenness (hooray for inventing words!) of the week continued with a successful round of experiments for my research. I have been conducting research in a lab since January of sophomore year that isolates and characterizes the enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of lincomycin, an antibiotic used to treat penicillin-resistant infections such as MRSA. By understanding how each of the enzymes in the bacteria <em>Streptomyces lincolnensis </em>function to naturally produce this antibiotic, we hope to identify ways to modify the enzymes so as to keep the drug one step ahead of antibiotic resistance. While I am a little out of my comfort zone in working with DNA (I&#8217;m normally a protein kind of girl), I&#8217;m really excited about my project this semester&#8211; I&#8217;m taking it in a new direction and learning a lot of new experimental techniques!</p>
<p>A lot of this week has also been spent preparing for the annual National Collegiate Emergency Medical Services Foundation conference! Nine other members of Muhlenberg College EMS and I are heading to Washington DC this weekend to attend seminars and skills labs pertaining to the intricacies of collegiate EMS, participate in competitions, and connect with over 1,000 collegiate EMTs across the country! Expect pictures in future posts <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> For now, here is a picture of some of my MCEMS family and me. They are some of my best friends on campus!</p>
