								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The book </span><span class="s2">the App Generation</span><span class="s1"> by Howard Gardner and Katie Davis describes the complexities of the technology associated with our generation today. One main point of the excerpt was that the apps a person downloads can be completely different than other people in their generation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>However, all the apps are downloaded with the same intention. This intention is to portray an ideal self image. The article even describes apps and social media as “ identity playgrounds“ (Gardner &amp; Davis ,2014).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>People today would rather spend their time making it look like their having fun than actually trying to have fun. “On Facebook people are more concerned with making it look like they’re living<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>rather than actually living” (Gardner &amp; Davis ,2014).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> What I found interesting in the book was that there was not only an emphasis on digital impressions. There was<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>also an emphasis on the characteristics of the app generation as well. One character trait was narcissism. Teens in the app generation are narcissistic in their appearances because they get constant reassurances from how many likes on Facebook they get. However in real life they are afraid to take risks because in life there is no like button. One point that I find extremely relevant to today’s society is that we do not take enough reflection time. We are constantly on our phones looking at comment sections or texting people that we don&#8217;t have time to formulate our own opinions. Standardized tests are so structured today that they are more about filling in the right bubble then the formulation of opinions on the topic. Teens need someone to emulate if they can’t formulate opinions themselves. This is why they emulate celebrities and famous people on social media. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> I think that it is fascinating that in previous article read in class , As we may think, people were predicting and looking forward to future technology (Bush, 1945). What I am always curious about is even though they could predict the technologies that were going to be made in the future, could they predict the way that it would effect our generation? I also wonder if even people in the early stages of technology could predict the way technology would affect us today. This also makes me wonder how future technology will have affected the generations in the future.</span></p>
