					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I also wrote about the part where you stated &quot;Reading has the power to help us better understand ourselves.&quot; I think reading gives us inspiration and gets one interested in things they didn&#039;t know about beforehand. With that said, it better defines who we are and our interests. It then guides us in the right direction and helps us learn right from wrong. With an increased amount of reading comes new information and ultimately lets us see the world differently.&lt;/p&gt;
