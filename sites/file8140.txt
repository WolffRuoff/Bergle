								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When one thinks of copyright law they automatically associate it with a positive. Copyright law was created with the intention of doing right by the public, encouraging self-expression and further promoting the artistic creativity of the public. However, when we begin to look deeper into the law as opposed to viewing it from the surface we begin to see a lot of gray-area evolve, diminishing much of the positive aspects of such law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Today, we are living in a digital world, with a large portion of our lives residing online. With this change one begins to wonder who is protecting our rights in this new world? Are copyright laws thorough enough to address the issues that arise in this new world, and are they efficient enough to take a real stand on the issue of infringement?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The concern associated with copyright laws have been a long time running, and this new world has only exasperated these problems. It appears copyright law has not been able to appropriately keep up with these changes due to the complex and costly legal procedures usually associated with such. This has only further restrained one’s creative expression. Essentially, the matter of copyright law and fair use is subjective. Everything is on a “case-by-case” basis, and as a small player going up against large established company you find yourself fighting an uphill battle that does not appear to be worth the time or money expended. In agreement with Professor Merges “creativity should not be stifled by litigation;” however, on the contrary the law does need to be adjusted to reflect what Mr. Efroni considers the “practical realities of modern life and technological advancements.” The law needs to be looked at objectively, without consideration for profit, modified appropriately, and then enforced in a nonpartisan manner. Copyright law is extremely important to preserving the public’s right to self-expression and continued ownership of individual ideas and ongoing steps need to be taken to maintain these rights.</span></p>
