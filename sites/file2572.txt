					<description><![CDATA[Very interesting article here, Group 4, and I think you have done a much better job of tackling the larger context of what this means for the industry in terms of power roles.  What&#039;s interesting here, as you point out, is a disagreement between the television industry and the online industry (via Hulu) over distribution.  Except here is a case where a distributor (the TV network) is battling with a distributor in another industry (Hulu).  The problem of not being able to measure the demographics of the audience online is also key, since it risks the resources of another key TV industry player, advertisers (client power role).  I still would like you to find some meatier articles to explore, but your analysis this time was much improved.  Keep up the good work!]]></description>
