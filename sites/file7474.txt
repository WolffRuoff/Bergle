								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span lang="EN-US">“Since its </span><span lang="EN-US">commercial birth in </span><span lang="EN-US">the 1950s </span><span lang="EN-US">as a </span><span lang="EN-US">technological oddity at a science fair, gaming has blossomed into one of most profitable entertainment </span><span lang="EN-US">industries in the</span><span lang="EN-US"> world.</span><span lang="EN-US">” (Chiknani</span><span lang="EN-US">, 2015)But how </span><span lang="EN-US">does the gaming industries exuberant in such a short time? As we all know, in 1967, the first game system designed </span><span lang="EN-US">and named “Brown Box”. But the “Brown Box” didn’t sold well because the mismanaged and the fact that home gaming was a relatively alien concept to average American at that time. And how technology’</span><span lang="EN-US">s advancement and the increase </span><span lang="EN-US">of the gaming community changed this situation through the history?</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">In 1970s, the first example of players competing on separate screens came and made the gaming community bigger. Later, technological advancements such as Intel’s invention of the world’s first microprocessor made the home gaming became a reality. Recently, the invention of the personal computers and the appearance of Smartphone made the gaming became more convenience, diverse, and interesting. These changes not only make the gaming industries flower, but also change people life.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">It is hard for the people in 1970s to believe that nowadays more than 42 percent of Americans are gamers and four out of five U.S. households have a console. To see these changes in a positive way, the advance of the gaming really rich people’</span><span lang="EN-US">s life, satisfy the demand that people can never get from the reality, and relax people from the serious social pressure. But on the other hand,</span> <span lang="EN-US">the increase of the gaming community made the age of the gamers become smaller and smaller. And this is a very worrying thing because teens don’t have the ability to judge the right and wrong. I used to see the news that a fifteen years old teen killed his friend in a quarrel, when asked about the reason, he said: “I killed people who made me unhappy in the game, and don’t worry, he will soon resurrect.” </span><span lang="EN-US">What a lamentable thing! And the </span><span lang="EN-US">gaming also reduces the time that people spend on outdoor activities which is a bad thing for our health</span><span lang="EN-US">.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">About the </span><span lang="EN-US">future, because the technologies </span><span lang="EN-US">like virtual reality and artificial intelligence technology will make the gaming </span><span lang="EN-US">experience become more stimulating, interesting, authentic, how to protect ourselves from the gaming become a problem.</span></p>
