								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Technology has taken a turn. Teachers and students are within a period of enlightenment and change. The educational curriculum and methods to learning are undergoing a new approach, but are yet to be fully adopted. The current stage of innovation and advancement lies between two ages, the old and the new. The direction we’re headed for is far from where we started but at the same time, nowhere near the finish. People are being forced into making changes to keep pace with the everlastingly growth of society. Some in which we don&#8217;t even question and just move on. Educators are in the midst of many technological innovations and to keep up with the leap, it has become imperative to match these alterations promptly.</p>
<p>Many educators are aware of the movement and are trying to find the perfect balance. According to Jacobs (2010, p. 7), many are asking themselves “what is it we want students to know and be able to do?” What’s the primary goal? And the answer is, change the way we do things to benefit society. In chapter one, Jacobs (2010, p. 8) stated, be more deliberate and develop better ways of learning and thinking. In other words, to spring new ideas, make life swifter and ultimately improve generations to come. But why now you may ask. Currently, society sits in a period full of technological advancements which are strengthening the ways to better ourselves. This relates to our class discussion on technological growth.</p>
<p>School is a place where students challenge themselves and try to reach their targets. But the traditional way of educating students is far from the standard set back in the late 1800’s. From ink to pencils and from papyrus to paper, to the development of e-books, computers and now tablets, curriculum and the methods in which many learn has drastically changed. According to Jacobs (2010, p. 9), it’s evolving now more than ever. Schools around the world continue taking notice and are integrating these changes into their learning process. But there is still a vast majority of schools who have not implemented these advancements yet. For example, laws and privacy, as discussed in class, has kept some away from this movement. In addition, high costs and area/region along with a slew of other factors have kept adoption rate to a minimalist.</p>
<p>In chapter one, Jacobs (2010, p. 9) stated, “the concept of what school is does not need reform-it needs new forms.” This citation further exemplifies the educational technological movement and is essential to the common theme of this essay. But why? It&#8217;s not what we&#8217;re learning that needs to be revised, it&#8217;s the method in which we learn. With all this new technology, there&#8217;s work that can be done to make students better off. Such as using new programs, shifting from written assignments to online, reducing printing and having a more interactive learning experience. Many nowadays find these methods more interesting than the standard methods of learning. The reason this movement continues on is because many find education as a key importance in society. Although some disagree, the vast majority agrees this is the right thing to do in that these progressions will better prepare students for their future, which will in due course, impact the wealth of society.</p>
<p>Education is a major area of focus. The recent increase of technological advancements has directly led to a substantial increase in ways to better off curriculum. Society is progressing fast, but not until it has fully adopted the changes will a difference be made visible. New developmental hardware and software have made it easier to learn in a variety of ways. Online programs offer more hands on experience, ease of use and an increased amount of ways that one can learn interactively. Many agree that these new methods will allow students to further engage with their studies, comprehend information more easily, and create a new way of thinking and interpreting information. But the list doesn’t stop there. With this direction in toe and progressions in full swing, it’s a great time to make a change.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have we really reached a world that we might have to start using social Media to enhance our learning? Technology has already changed the way kids are learning so I couldn’t imagine kids using social media to learn. Using social media to learn would be very hard to do because kids most likely do not even focus on the work they would be reading up on their news feeds and talking to friends, but in the same senses I feel that kids would absorb information if it was laid out in social media. If your class was set up as a twitter feed I’m sure many kids would have such an easy time navigating through the work. It would be very interesting to see someone try to set a class up like that, or even if it was set up as Facebook.</p>
<p>But social media can be used in many other different ways for learning. Like in the article “Twitter for teaching: Can social media be used to enhance the process of learning?” Chris Evans does research to see if Twitter helps enhances the process of learning, but he uses students who have never used twitter before. It is interesting to see students who haven’t used twitter before become introduced to it in an educational way.</p>
<p>Evans has the students interact with their tutor over twitter using hashtags so that it is easy for the tutors to be able to go and look at what each student is asking. Evans asks in his research if this replaces kids being able to go to class, which he showed that it doesn’t cause even though the students question or concern might be answered, it can never replace the act of walking in to a class and sitting down for a lecture. Social media can never replace the act of going in to a classroom and having a face to face interaction with a teacher or professor.</p>
<p>Evans studied many different aspects of twitter and educations and he figured out that yes it did help students get more evolved and engage in what they were learning. But you will never be able to replace the classroom, social media will be able to help enhance learning. But I don’t think it will ever replace it.</p>
<p>This is something that as my generation gets older should start paying attention to because there might be a day where our kids don’t even go and sit in a class room. They will be learning everything online. They might not even know what a text book is because they will most likely be caring around a tablet or some technological devices that holds all their information that they need.</p>
<p>Our parents telling us how they remember a day without all this technology, we will be saying to our kids how we remember the days of text books and sitting in classrooms. At some point though I think someone will need to step in and make sure that the idea of sitting in a class room remains that way. Because we don’t want future generations not learning how to socialize in person and not getting those learning experiences that we get.</p>
<p>The movement of technology needs to start slowing down and we need to start looking at how much time we spend already looking at a screen. Its unhealthy and the last thing I would want is to be taking classes all online and using social media to help.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="mceItemHidden">Technology and smart devices are coming to new places in a variety of forms. Moving forward, technology is increasingly becoming a part of our daily lives. More than we even know it. But what does this mean for our generation? The goal is simple. To better the lives of many, keep everyone connected and make lives hassle free. But the transformation is easier said than done. Education is among one of the biggest undergoing changes. Current students have more ways than ever to explore new ideas and solve problems. And the growth is not coming to an end any time soon.</span></p>
<p><span class="mceItemHidden">The world is moving at a rapid pace and it’s directly led by recent technological innovations. Some of the most significant improvements are those taking place inside the classroom. Most say Technology’s integration with education enhances a student’s learning experience. However, <span class="hiddenSpellError">unrelatedly</span>, many see it as overwhelming, more time-consuming and difficult to make the change. However, this can’t be agreed to by everyone. New programs are allowing students to complete assignments entirely on their wireless devices without the need to pick up a pencil. Many find this very intriguing. New sharing options let students send off their assignments to teachers with ease. In addition, technology helps students stay in contact over weekends and school breaks.</span></p>
<p><span class="mceItemHidden">Another major strength of technology in the classroom is research, which has become easier than ever. The wide range of sources available right at one’s fingertips <span class="hiddenSuggestion">provide</span> students with speed and accuracy. Many agree, however, there is also a large <span class="hiddenSuggestion">selection</span> of garbage and irrelevant inaccurate information and people need <span class="hiddenGrammarError">to be</span> aware of. Throughout the encyclopedia article, the idea that mobile learning is controversial repeatedly comes up. But why? While technology in the classroom may seem useful to the <span class="hiddenSuggestion">majority</span>, many see it as distracting. Others say it’s even more time-consuming than standard learning and can cause stress due to common system errors making productivity a challenge. Additionally, many see it as unreliable and <span class="hiddenGrammarError">an invasion of</span> privacy. Being a student myself, it’s sometimes hard to disagree. According to (&#8220;Technology integration,&#8221; 2015), another concern <span class="hiddenGrammarError">is cost</span>. With all that one gets with access to a mobile device, it can become costly when having to <span class="hiddenSuggestion">provide</span> devices for a whole class. It’s believed by many that technology for the classroom is a work in progress that’s constantly growing and expanding.</span></p>
<p><span class="mceItemHidden">One key benefit of technology’s integration in the classroom is interactive learning. According to (&#8220;Technology integration,&#8221; 2015), the thought process and conceptual experience makes for an easier learning process. But why? By learning from one’s mistakes, students can make changes, review and perfect assignments and thus learn by doing. So what? This method has been proven <span class="hiddenGrammarError">to be</span> one of the best ways for the brain to absorb information.</span></p>
<p><span class="mceItemHidden">Being able to work on projects simultaneously with one another submit to the teacher for review all though a handheld device is something people in the past have only dreamed about. This relates to the class reading on how technology has evolved over time. According to (&#8220;Technology integration,&#8221; 2015), a project-based activity can enhance one’s ability to work in groups and solve more complex problems that one couldn’t normally complete on their own. In addition, interactive learning can also be fun and enjoyable. So What? This keeps the mind flowing and ultimately keeps students focused for longer periods at a time. This <span class="hiddenGrammarError">can be</span> very noticeable. As a result of recent technological advancements, it’s clear that collaboration plays a major role in the learning process. </span></p>
<p><span class="mceItemHidden">Technology in the classroom has come a long way. With <span class="hiddenGrammarError">the addition of</span> new programs and services, the methods to learning have changed drastically. Despite high costs, privacy issues, distractions, and often less reliability, technology in the classroom is becoming increasingly common throughout school districts around the globe. In relation to class discussions, many agree that technology is always growing and the only thing that stands in the way of adoption is time and effort. <span class="hiddenSpellError">Infographics</span> in recent class assignments have shown us the numbers <span class="hiddenSuggestion">pertaining to</span> the increasing adoption of digital media. Major brands are hard at work attempting to bring the latest and greatest to everyone so that lives <span class="hiddenGrammarError">will</span> be made easier and education <span class="hiddenGrammarError">can be</span> improved for all. </span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Think about how many times a day you read. From the moment you wake up, you are reading everything from street signs to text messages, from newspapers to billboards. People constantly complain about having to read, despite the fact that reading is extremely crucial to our existence. If no one was able to read, it would be very hard to function in society. Mike Hanksi informs us just how important reading is in his article <i>Want to Be a Better Writer? Read More.</i> Within his opening he states,“Reading is fashionable. Again. It’s cool. We bet you can all find many statements about how good and useful reading is, how much it can influence a person and his way of thinking… ” (Hanski, 2014).</p>
<p>If someone explained to you exactly how to be a great writer, would you listen? If they laid everything out, would you follow through? Hanski does just this. He depicts the sole way to becoming a successful writer is by reading. By doing this, one will become more educated and discover inspiration. Ideas obtained through reading will only increase your ability when writing. Reading can make your brain function stronger; it exercises your mind and circulates blood flow to the brain. From there it continues with reducing the likelihood of contracting Alzheimer’s disease and even makes a person more sympathetic. The benefits of reading are endless, so why would one not take that chance and run with it. It’s a no brainer to utilize reading as a tool to just make your writing exceptional and to improve your quality of life.  Mike quotes famous author Stephen King,“ If you don’t have the time to read, you don’t have the time (or the tools) to write. Simple as that” (Hanski, 2014). Even a well renowned, published author agrees with Hanski that reading is quite an essential aspect of being a great writer.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left">     Mike Hanski&#8217;s article titled &#8220;Want to be a Better Writer? Read More.&#8221; discusses the importance of how reading can benefit numerous aspects of the self. Some of his major points included that reading influences your writing, influences your study, and most importantly in my opinion, increases your vocabulary. Having a well-built vocabulary is not only beneficial for your writing and for school, but for everyday life. After college when it comes time to apply and interview for jobs it is valuable to have an understanding of complex concepts and be able to converse intelligently as you get older. Hanski states that &#8220;reading widens a vocabulary, broadens a kid&#8217;s mind, and helps him understand the world better&#8221; (p.2). These are tools that are beneficial for a lifetime.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">     When I am reading and come across a word that seems unfamiliar, taking a few minutes to research the definition always makes a huge difference in my understanding of the reading. Additionally, I am learning new terms that I hopefully will be able to apply and make new ideas out of in future writings. As I build my vocabulary, I find that the quality of my writing increases, in addition to my overall performance in school. This is not only a huge confidence booster, but it encourages me to read more. I find that I feel most motivated to read when it is on a topic that I am interested in. I enjoy reading for pleasure beyond the reading that is assigned in class because it helps me to find where my interests are. Reading newspapers and non-fiction stories allow you to learn about the world which is so important to be knowledgable about. Today, with access to such a vast amount of portable technology such as Kindles, iPads, and iPhones, access to reading material has become easier than ever. In conclusion, if I didn&#8217;t read as much as I do, I would find myself struggling when it comes time to write papers and have to apply my knowledge into real world activities.</p>
