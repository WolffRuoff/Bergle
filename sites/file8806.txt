<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The article, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Want to Be a Better Writer? Read More.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> Is not only a piece about how someone must read in order to become better at writing, but also how reading influences other aspects of one’s life. It explains the many benefits of reading and how it can improve our daily lives. Some examples include, better writing skills, better study habits, and better mental health. It explains how a good writer can only achieve greatness by reading. Hanski writes, “Writing is a skill. But this skill is very complicated, because it can&#8217;t be got by simple learning of grammar rules, punctuation marks, and different writing techniques. Certainly, you should know how to write correctly, but only reading can help you achieve greatness.” I agree with this because writing, just like anything else need practice. No one got good at any type of sport without hard work and dedication. Hanski says how, “Writing is a skill.” I believe a skill is someone’s ability to master an activity. People require practice if they wish to be talented at something. Reading is one of the many ways one can better themselves as a writer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I also believe Hanski is saying that reading forces the brain to work therefor making it stronger in the end. Hanski writes, “Science confirms that </span><a href="http://news.stanford.edu/news/2012/september/austen-reading-fmri-090712.html"><span style="font-weight: 400">reading has a positive influence on your brain</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">: blood flows to it, improving brain&#8217;s functioning and connectivity; moreover, it has been proved that this functioning improves for days! So, read books &#8212; and you will help your brain function better.” Just like any muscle, the more you work it, the stronger it will get. Same thing goes for the brain. Once strong enough, it will become easier to do complex tasks such as writing. Many skills are intertwined so if you are practicing one thing there is a chance you are getting better at another.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Some would argue that an art form, like writing, cannot be taught. I believe that to a certain extent, this is true. An artist must add their own personal expression to their pieces. That is one of the things that makes art, art.  Hanski says, “Being a writer, you&#8217;ll probably agree with the fact that the art of writing is nearly impossible to teach. It is impossible to finish some courses on creative writing or graduate from some university with a diploma of &#8220;a professional writer.&#8221;’ What Hanski is saying here is that any art form, writing especially, cannot be taught. Only the fundamentals of an art form can be taught. Take music for example, you can teach a musician how to read music and play pieces correctly but you cannot teach him how to play with expression. That is something he must figure out for himself. That is one of the reasons why art is so difficult because only the artist can make it his own.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Overall, writing is complex because it cannot be taught. It is a skill one develops and masters over time. It is the writer&#8217;s job to figure out what does and does not work for him, and reading can help.</span></p>
