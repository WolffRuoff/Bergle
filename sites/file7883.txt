					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;According to the second point, (Students take classes. Faculty frame what will be learned in those classes. How does one ultimately take ownership of one’s own learning and education?) For person, most of the knowledge is told by teachers, but there is also a part of the knowledge that our parents told us. If you understand the point or keys (knowledge） in the class, you have the ownership of this knowledge, if you have not understood, you do not have ownership of learning. The teacher should to know how to impart this knowledge to the students, and the students must know how to get it( hard study). This is a relative situation.&lt;/p&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;For the first question, the answer is &quot;the domain of one&#039;s own&quot; will make students have a better atmosphere--they will have safety and security (financially well before technologically) atmosphere to think and write. So they don&#039;t have to worry about the things other than writing, for example: money, house, or eating.
And when they put their focus on the writing, their ideas will flower and the structure and logic in the article will look more rigorous.
the answer of second question: As a student, the knowledge I learned almost from the school and teachers, so sometimes it&#039;s hard for me to be &quot;the domain of my own&quot;, because the knowlege we learned mostly depend on the teachers and  even the school, we can not control it. The things we can control are to decide how many extra reading we do, how many time we use to review the knowledge we learned and how hard we try to understand the knowledge ourselves even the teacher didn&#039;t say it clearly in class.&lt;/p&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Thats a really great point. Getting good grades in school is only half the work that needs to be done. We also have to learn how how write a professional email and make connections for future jobs. Professors can only do so much for us and it is our job to take the reigns early on to drive our education and future.&lt;/p&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Thats a very interesting and insightful way at looking at ownership. It rings true in so many different ways and while I was going through the college search, my parents kept reassuring me that any school would be fine because the outcome was based on how I took control of my education. We can&#039;t make up excuses about things not turning out the way we want. We need to take charge and take responsibility for our own lives.&lt;/p&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I agree with your response, Caroline, and I also think it&#039;s important for students to actively question what their professors teach them. Their professors have much more experience and knowledge about the field to be learned from, but they are also presenting the information however they choose, and students can question that format or interpretations they&#039;re given to make it their own, too.&lt;/p&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Although people who study information do not own the information they study, I believe that they take ownership in how well they retain the information for certain tests and quizzes.  It is on you to get an A, B, C, D, or F in a class; you own that specific grade.  Teachers present the information to you.  Teachers do not own the information they present, but they own the style and the effectiveness to which they present that information.  The students own how well they are concentrated to retain the information to do well in the class.  The students own what they want to do when they grow up.  I believe that is how students take ownership with their education.  Although they do not own the information being learned, they own the hunger and desire to get good grades, go to a good college, and get the job that they want.&lt;/p&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I think that in order to take full ownership of ones education they will need to implement the education. For example becoming a biology major is great. However the students that get a great job with that degree are the ones who take full advantage of their education.&lt;/p&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Students ultimately take ownership of one&#039;s own learning and education. What you get out of it has a lot to do with what you put into it. Faculty can only do so much. If the student does not put in effort and work to their full potential then they will not learn and get an education. Faculty is trained to do their job and are qualified to teach and help students understand. But, if a student does not understand something they should go out of their way for further clarification from the professor. They should not just say it is the professor&#039;s fault they don&#039;t know something without putting in effort to know it.&lt;/p&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, there are many different ways that one can take control of their own education For example, I believe that we can decide wether or not we succeed academically. I pride myself in learning to the best of my ability. I own my education, and how well I do in school. We as students are given the choice to go to college, pick our classes, died to show up, decide if we are going to listen, decide if we are going to do the homework. There are so many different elements to owning your education, and we are given a tremendous amount of opportunities to do so. So, yes, I believer that we do own our own education.&lt;/p&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;One simply can&#039;t control what they own digitally, such as apps like Netflix, amazon, and music apps. One simply just pays for the music or the subscription. Therefore, for me personally I take pride in what I own. And as a student, I own my education and what I learn. I like to absorb all the information given to me and apply it to my everyday self. I own what each teacher expresses and teaches to me so I can express it to others. It is important for me to take what I learn along the journey because without it, my education does not serve its purpose. Teachers main goal is to sink information into the student, so in essence they &quot;own&quot; it.&lt;/p&gt;
