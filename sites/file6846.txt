								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In today’s typical job interview, employers spend less time testing candidates on specific technical knowledge or practiced tasks like typing, math knowledge, and industry related procedures than before. What’s their new focus? Soft skills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Soft skills are less about memorization, more about interpersonal interaction like critical thinking, team-building, and communication. Having a degree already demonstrates a level of competence with the hard skills of a given industry, but modern companies are quickly realizing that’s only one part of what makes the ideal employee. Equally important is the overall takeaway from classes, and development of these soft skills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So how can you prepare for your job hunt and make sure you’re developing the right skillset to help you succeed in your chosen career path? There are a few key focus areas employers look for across the board, that benefit employees at all levels, in any position.</span></p>
<p><b>Powerful Communication</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In nearly every situation, whether it’s at work or in a social encounter, strong and clear communication skills are important. Clearly defining intent and purpose with language in writing or vocally can prevent miscommunications and confusion, and employers consider that a key, universal skill. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Professor David Scobey, an American studies and history professor at the University of Michigan, said in an </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2018/04/18/600855667/what-adult-learners-really-need-hint-its-not-just-job-skills"><span style="font-weight: 400">interview with NPR</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, “employers complain they can&#8217;t find workers with communications, problem-solving and other soft skills.” With these skills in high demand and low supply, those that demonstrate solid communication can find themselves becoming a valuable asset in any group. If everyone is communicating clearly, mistakes are less likely to happen, and workflows can move more quickly and efficiently. </span></p>
<p><b>Effective Teaming</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Communication is a major aspect of working as a part of a team, either as a leader or a member. Part of being a member of a team is listening to others and recognizing the abilities of everyone involved. Leah Weiss writes in “</span><a href="https://bized.aacsb.edu/articles/2019/january/the-case-for-soft-skills"><span style="font-weight: 400">The Case For Soft Skills</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">” that in “a study of more than 10,000 HR participants, companies are actively seeking to assemble adaptable and ‘team-centric’ workplace teams in order to meet future needs.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Companies are thinking of the long-term when it comes to hires. With the ever changing landscape of technology and the market, hiring for specific technical skills is less important than someone who fits with the company socially. A team that can work together effectively and create a kind of synergy can collectively elevate the environment of a business.</span></p>
<p><b>Problem Solving</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is impossible to plan or train for every eventuality, so employers are looking for candidates that can adapt and find solutions to situations as they come up. Critical thinking is crucial to a developing workplace. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nicole Fallon, </span><a href="https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/7532-critical-thinking-in-business.html"><span style="font-weight: 400">in her review</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> of Jen Lawrence’s “</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Engage-Fox-Business-Critically-Motivating/dp/1626341230?&amp;tag=businessnewsdaily-20"><span style="font-weight: 400">Engage the Fox: A Business Fable About Thinking Critically and Motivating Your Team</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">,” said that, “critical thinking helps employees gather all of the information required to analyze a situation, generate optimal solutions to a problem and get feedback from all the people involved in the situation.” Using this honed and developed skill of critical thinking, workplaces become more efficient, and generally continue to improve over time. </span></p>
<p><b>Emotional Intelligence</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When working in a career, or any workplace for that matter, connecting with others is almost always a necessity. Communication is definitely a part of that, but the ability to identify with and earn the trust and respect of others can make teamwork that much easier. Dr. Deborah Benson, the owner of L4L Leadership, </span><a href="https://www.director.co.uk/developingyour-leadership-skills-18125-2/"><span style="font-weight: 400">said in an interview with Director Magazine</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> that, “If people don’t trust you they won’t wish to follow you. If, for example, you do not have the emotional intelligence to understand why a member of staff is resisting instructions and behaving poorly you will struggle to bring them on board.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Essentially, if coworkers do not identify with the leader in the room, it’ll be more difficult to effectively work together. Exercising these interpersonal skills, building an emotional intelligence, and working to establish stronger connections go a long way when establishing a strong workplace community. </span></p>
<p><b>What Hiring Managers Want</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">More and more, hiring managers are looking to soft skills to help determine who is the best for an open position. They are seeking out those who can consistently connect with others in the workplace  and make emotionally intelligent decisions and judgement calls. Critical thinking can ensure that regardless of what situations may arise in the workplace, employees will be able to address whatever may come up. A strong team-based work environment ensures that every member of the business feels supported, boosts productivity, and secures employees for the long-term. Effective communication can help with streamlining processes and improves workplace efficiency. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In this ever changing jobs market, technical proficiency is always important, but these soft skills are becoming increasingly crucial to advancing in the workplace. Strengthening these skills must be a priority when looking ahead for future members of the workforce.</span></p>
