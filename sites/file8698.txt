								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Technology has come a long way. The learning process that we all once knew has developed into a full virtual experience in such little time. If you hated interpreting those geographic maps in your textbook, you’re going love what the future holds. With the creation of Google Earth, Google put education first and foremost in its aims to bring learning to the next stage. Google Earth lets people carry out a countless number of actions unlike all ways before it. Each bringing a slew of benefits. One example allows people to look back on and notice cultural changes. While this is good for many, it’s especially good for scientists and historians who can further observe and analyze research using findings provided on the new platform. Another gives students visions of places they have learned about but are unable to travel to. So What? Being able to see the world in a lens, right in front of you allows people to see things that may no longer exist. Thus making it history. It can also help solve problems as to why an incident may have occurred in an easy and interactive way. Many have found Google Earth to be intruding and have already begun using the new technology in their life. Whether that be for their own use, in the office or on the go. Technology has come so far already, but many are predicting this is just the start.</p>
<p>Education is a big part in society and Google Earth has taken learning to the next level. A better education can mean a lot. Buy why? Ultimately it makes the next generation smarter. Which then sets the bar even higher for the next generation. Thus ensuring technology’s expansion. Google Earth has contributed highly to the understanding of recent history and the exploration of other countries. Prior to Google Earth, the methods of learning geography were not on par. Nowadays, being able to virtually navigate and see all angles and not just photos supply’s countless benefits to one’s overall learning experience. According to (Williams and Davinroy, 2015), “when students see for themselves the relationships between location, culture, and events, they become more engaged with the material we present.” This line is significant because it perfectly summarizes what Google Earth is all about. Throughout the article the idea that students absorb more knowledge using this method of learning is repeatedly addressed. Many find this concept interesting and agree, however, there are still a select bunch that prefer old style learning. According to (Williams and Davinroy, 2015), learning Earth Science has become a totally new experience, in addition, understanding Geography, history and even language classes have been impacted.</p>
<p>While Education is important, Google Earth can also strengthen one’s interpreting skills. Two of the most important ones being observing and analyzing. By constantly browsing on Google Earth, one is contextually observing what’s on screen and furthering their analyzing skills by making interpretations of the place in which they’re viewing. According to (Williams and Davinroy, 2015), with Google Earth at one’s side, students are more motivated to go explore the world, even when it’s not for a mandatory assignment. They’re also more likely to retain the information from the course because absorbing information from visuals has been proven easier than that of books. So what? The more locations and geographical features someone is exposed to, the larger the odds he/she will relate what they saw to something in the future. Ultimately, it has the power to broaden one’s mind with a variety of places around the world, solve mysteries, and even expand upon one’s skills thus lasting a life time.</p>
<p>Google Earth is giving people the chance to virtually discover the world through a single application. It’s teaching people long-lasting skills such as observation and analyzation, in addition to improving education in many different ways. The useful tools we have now that weren’t possible in the past are becoming successively better than the generation before. Google Earth opens up many opportunities by letting us explore any place whenever we want at a glance. As discussed in class, it amazes many to see the world’s growth in technology and it’s making for a better and enhanced future.</p>
