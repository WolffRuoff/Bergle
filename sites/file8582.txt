								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In 2010, co-founders Travis Kalanick and Garrett Camp released an app that would change transportation forever. With technology growing at a rapid rate as well as apps and social media starting to become increasingly important in everyday life, Uber was created as an easier, quicker, and cheaper way to transport. Starting in only big cities such as New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago, Uber proved to be the mode of transportation that each city was lacking. In New York, the iconic yellow taxi ruled the streets but with such a high demand all the time, finding an unoccupied cab was easier said than done. In a matter of seconds Uber lets each user set their location, destination, gives a fare estimate, and labels what time the cab will arrive at your given destination. Uber gives smartphone users the ability to connect with their driver in the easiest and cheapest way possible. The best part about Uber is not having to directly pay the driver for their services. All payments are linked through a credit or debit card account that charges the passenger once their ride is over. The creation of Uber has changed the way people travel from place to place. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With Uber’s massive success in the United States throughout limited cities, the company decided to expand globally. As of 2015, Uber has launched in 60 cities worldwide including countries all over Asia, Africa, and Europe. Traveling through a foreign country can be extremely difficult in terms of navigation but Uber has given people the ability to not have to be able to communicate in an unfamiliar language in order to get from place to place. With the ability to use your current location and set a destination where you would like to go, Uber has eliminated helplessly looking for historics sites, a restaurant, or any other specific location. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Uber is not just available in big cities but has also branched out to rural and suburb areas. In a small town, rarely does anyone ever see a taxi just driving around looking for a customer and not every small town has a taxi service willing to pick someone up and drive that passenger long distances. Uber has given people in less populated areas the ability to get from place to place at the with just a few taps on their smartphones. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The requirements for becoming an Uber driver include being able to pass a background check as well as having a license and car. Once these tasks are passed, you are free to be an Uber driver. This proves to be one of the reasons along with cheaper prices why Uber is currently taking over cities around the world. In a place like London, it takes up to four years to become a taxi driver. Each candidate must drive around the city on a motorcycle learning all the streets from a book that they are given by the taxi service. In New York, each candidate must attend a training course to become a yellow cab driver. Uber does not require any of these steps which makes people more inclined to become an Uber driver rather than a Taxi company. With Uber’s growing presence in places all over the world, taxi drivers have become more and more irritated by Uber drivers taking their business. Just this summer in Paris, violent protests broke out between Uber drivers and Taxi company drivers. The protests definitely indicate a shift from taxi companies to Uber controlling the roads. With Uber working everyday to improve their services, it&#8217;s only a matter of time before they eliminate taxi companies forever and continue changing the way we travel. </span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Before apps and the internet, people needed to wait to get their news. Newspapers were delivered early in the morning packed front to back with the latest news from the day before. Aside from the nightly news, newspapers were the main way to know what was going on in the world. Mornings were spent reading newspaper articles at the breakfast table while sipping coffee and eating breakfast. Fast forward to the 21st century where people rely on apps such as Twitter to get breaking information at the palm of their hands instead of waiting for the paper boy to deliver the newspaper every morning. With an increasing reliability on apps that provide breaking news whenever and wherever, the use of newspapers is at an all time low and continuing to decline. According to research done by The Future Exploration Network, “Newspapers in their current form will become insignificant in the United States by 2017,” (Gunelius, 2014). The Future Exploration Network’s research has the United States as the first country to forgo newspapers. Soon after their 2017 prediction for the United States, nations such as Iceland, Canada, Norway, England, and Finland will all follow the United States in eliminating newspapers in current form. Gunelius states that the end is definitely approaching for newspapers, “Unless newspapers can find a way to transform their business models, Future Exploration Network’s extinction predictions for newspapers as we know them could come to fruition even sooner. Research keeps showing again and again that the end is near. How soon the end will arrive has yet to be determined,”(Gunelius,2014). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With the extinction of newspapers in their current paper form on the way, no one is able to deny that the world continues to become more and more digital by the day. As I read Gunelius’ article, I thought of how books have gone digital with the Kindle and the ability to download books straight to your smartphone. Schools are starting to use Ipads and and other tablets for reading books instead of having physical copies for students. I believe that books in their current form will not be available in a matter of years just as The Future Exploration Network predicted for newspapers. Huge bookstore chains such as Barnes and Noble have had a huge increase in store closures as a result of the increase in digital purchases of books.  With the digital world becoming increasingly widespread every single day, physical copies of newspapers, books, magazines and other paper produced materials have their days limited.</span></p>
