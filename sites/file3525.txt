					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Great article and, yes, very scary indeed!  It&#039;s easy to see why critics like Robert McChesney are so disturbed by the hyper-commercialization of broadcast television today.  With dwindling audience attention, these lines between creative and news content and the advertising will continue to blur, creating some very jarring realities for the viewers.  How can you really enjoy your favorite TV show if it is constantly trying to sell you something?  My suspicion is that more viewers will begin deserting the networks, which will make this problem even more acute.  It may help the networks to survive financially, but at what cost to innovation and creativity?  Thanks for the interesting article, Group 4!&lt;/p&gt;
