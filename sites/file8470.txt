								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Facebook is just another one of the countless forms of social media that my generation uses to see what their “friends” are doing. One’s news feed is the endless list that updates itself as people upload new content. These news feeds encompass status updates, pictures, and even articles that people like and share. The problem with Facebook occurs when users accept friend requests from people they don&#8217;t actually know. Now these strangers have access to not only personal pictures, but personal information.</p>
<p>Robert Lemieux, a professor in the communication department at McDaniel College, conducted a study about privacy on Facebook. His participants had to construct a fictitious profile with the name Jamie Marple and a profile picture showing both a girl and a boy. The name Jamie was chosen because of the possibility that it could fit either gender. The only other information on the profile aside from the name and the extremely vague picture, was “Jamie’s” date of birth and hometown. “Since the study’s primary interest was to test the likelihood of being accepted as a friend based on limited, personal information, Jamie’s personal information was severely limited” (Lemieux, 2012). Another group of participants within the study were informed to friend Jamie and write on her profile. This made it look like Jamie was real and active user.</p>
<p>The entire purpose of Lemieux’s study was to see if people would accept a friend request from a person with a questionable profile that they really did not know. The results proved that kids are willing to accept friend requests from even the profiles that have meager amounts of information. “Results indicated that 325 Facebook members (72% of the sample) willingly accepted the friendship of the unknown individual” (Lemieux, 2012). More than 50% of Facebook users were willing to welcome a new friendship despite knowing such a minute amount of information about them.</p>
<p>What’s the issue with this? Why is it so bad to casually accept a friend request on Facebook? You see that you have some mutual friends with this persons so it must not be a big deal. Many problems however could come along with the spontaneous action of accepting anyone and everyone. Not only is your privacy in jeopardy, but your security is too. Once accepting that friend request, the person on the other side of the computer has access to very personal information like where you live or where you go to school. They can also see pictures that you post, and pictures other people post of you. One day someone unwanted could find out where you live or the wrong person could see you at a party holding a beer. Would you want that?</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you were to tell the creators of the internet how big and how widely used it would become in the 21st century, they probably would laugh at you. They would not understand how regular users have made it what it has become. The Internet now has the ability to connect so many people though laughter using a single media object and a phrase. These funny and sometimes disturbing images or media objects are known throughout the internet world as memes. Memes however, can become extremely dangerous. They can degrade individuals and even whole groups of people as well as causing damage to cultures and ethnicities. Memes can be extremely funny for everyone if used properly.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The peer-reviewed article I read was </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Reflections on Internet Culture</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">. The article talked about internet memes and how society reacted to them. Some memes pass through the eyes of the internet harmlessly while others may not. One major theme that appears throughout the article is how what you say or do online may affect other things offline. Zittrain writes, “Star Wars Kid turned to the court system, and filed a host of lawsuits against the school, the kids, their parents,” (Zittrain, 2014, p. 390). Star Wars Kid was a video that received 28 million hits on Youtube of a kid who was swinging a golf ball retriever not knowing he was being recorded. His friends thought it would be funny if they posted it online, it became an instant hit. This just goes to show how you never know how somebody will react when you post something about them online. Something may seem harmless to post online at first but may actually be harmful in the long run.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This can relate to another major theme brought up in the article. The theme of  online privacy and the argument of whether it is right to post about someone online just because it is funny. The author uses the example of Disaster girl in his writing, “a perfect example of unsought fame of a sort. She is not superimposed in the photo. She is actually standing in front of that house. The element of authenticity that this photo captures so well, though, means there is a real person implicated as it starts to go viral” (Zittrain, 2014, p. 389). I believe what the author is saying is that these people did not mind that they became famous through a meme. They thought it was funny when people would take the picture of a cute innocent girl standing in front of a burning house and add a funny caption. Other people, like Star Wars Kid, did not think it was so funny when they were posted online.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Overall, I think memes are great. They can be funny, insightful, and even inspiring. They have the ability to make people laugh and share a connection together. I also believe that since they are so powerful they can be used to hurt people. The argument of online privacy is found in every part of the internet including memes. I believe that if people are a little more careful with the power of memes they can be more enjoyable for everyone.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When people talk about Microsoft, the first thing that usually comes to people’s mind is Bill Gates and the software that he developed that made people’s lives so much easier. What a lot of people do not know however, is that Microsoft has many more services and software products marketed toward teens and gamers. The Wikipedia article I read was on Xbox Live which is an online multiplayer gaming and digital media delivery service developed by Microsoft. Most teens know about Xbox Live because it allows you to play video games online with your friends. It is an extremely popular service and mostly everyone that has ever owned a Microsoft gaming product has used it at least once. Xbox Live comes in two forms, Xbox Live Free and Xbox Live Gold. Xbox Live Gold being a subscription based service. Xbox Live offers a wide variety of features for the user. The most popular being the online gaming portion of the service.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One main theme that occurs from a lot of these gaming services is immersion. Most of them allow you to create and control an avatar and become fully immersed in the gaming world. As well as creating avatars, players can create and customize profiles based on their offline personalities and interests. Some people are skeptical of this because more and more kids are spending the majority of their time with online gaming. All these different elements of Xbox Live make it difficult for the user to get off. It has become addicting to some people to the point where they do not want to leave the gaming world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Microsoft has done something really smart with Xbox Live. They have made so many first and third party apps available on the service that it makes the user feel like he or she will never have to go anywhere else to use them. This means that Microsoft has essentially made Xbox Live the go to service to use these apps. Microsoft figures that the people using Xbox Live are most likely digital natives, so they market and sell Xbox Live accordingly. They also supply features on Xbox Live that fit that description. This is smart because as a digital native I figure that any apps I want to use will probably be on my Xbox. This maximizes the amount of users Xbox Live will have at any given moment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With online interaction also comes the dangers of cyberbullying, but what Xbox Live has done is that it has integrated different features to be safe online like muting, reporting, and blocking. It even has a “reputation” feature that allows people to see how good your in game conduct is. The truth is Xbox Live is expanding and it will keep getting bigger and more popular. Wikipedia writes, “As of December 16, 2012, Xbox Live is currently available in 42 countries/territories” and “Bloomberg estimates that Xbox Live likely generated over </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar"><span style="font-weight: 400">$</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">1 billion in revenue in the 2010 fiscal year, which ended on June 30, 2010.” These facts are only a little bit of information on how big Xbox Live could become especially with the progression of technology and gaming. I agree on the fact that Xbox Live is getting bigger because I know gaming is too. Online gaming can only get more popular as more people are looking for services to allow them to play online.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Overall, I believe Xbox Live is an extremely useful and popular service that lets you connect with people and friends all around the world, 42 countries to be exact. Gaming and online gaming services have just began to scratch the surface of all the different possibilities. It will be exciting to see in the future how much it can potentially expand.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Cyber Bullying and Facebook</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Social media has taken up a huge part of our daily lives. Without it we feel lost, unconnected with society, and left out. We have almost become completely dependent on it. I couldn&#8217;t imagine a day going without facebook, and many other people couldn&#8217;t either. We spend so much time online and meet so many new people through social networking it’s hard to tell who’s who online.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The article I read, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Cyberbullying on Facebook, How to Teach Teens About it?</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> Explains how the majority of our younger generation spends their time interacting online, especially on social media. The author explains the dangers of social media and the stigma associated with it. With all this time interacting online comes the danger of cyber bullying. People do not realize how prevalent and easy it is for someone to be bullied online. Bullies look to the internet and social media because it is easier to hurt someone online when there is an added anonymity factor. Bullies feel like it’s okay to bully other people online because they think it won’t hurt the other person. The author writes, “Cyber bullying takes behaviour born in the schoolyard and adds two elements: ubiquity and anonymity.” This is a very scary concept because what the author is saying is that a bully can be anywhere and anyone when you’re online. You never really know who is who online and you can never be sure that who you meet online is actually that person in real life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One main theme that comes up throughout the article is how people choose to behave online. The author writes, “Words that appeared frequently included “rude,” “mean,” “fake,” “crude,” “over-dramatic,” and “disrespectful.”’ I believe the sole reason that people are unkind online is anonymity. People feel as if there is a shield blocking them from the outside world. That is not true. Everything you say online stays there. Even when you think something is deleted, chances are it’s still there. Something you say online can hurt someone just as much if not more than if you said it to them in person. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A lot of people choose to act differently online because they feel like they can be someone else and change who they are. The author writes, “Often teens felt bolder, ruder, or more empowered </span><a href="http://nobullying.com/cyber-safety-facebook-and-real-life-the-struggle/"><span style="font-weight: 400">because they did not fear physical violence in the online space</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">.” The author also writes, “More often than not, teens believe that they find friends and romantic interests much easier to talk to and way more open in a Facebook chat conversation than in a playground or classroom context.” Both these quotes are related by anonymity. The fact that you can talk to someone (and possibly harm them as well) without being face to face with them. Some people may feel more comfortable talking online then in person.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Cyber bullying is connected with facebook in many ways, one of them being its popularity. So many people have access to facebook and it’s so easy to find people that it might be a cyber bully’s first place to look. The author says, “It can lead to the end of friendships, problems with parents, or wanting to avoid school. According to pewinternet.org, 88% of social media-using teens have seen someone be mean or cruel on Facebook.” 88% is a huge number of people who witness cyberbullying. Think of how large that number would be if private messaging didn’t exist and everything was public. That is just one of the reasons cyberbullying on Facebook is so prevalent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But cyber bullying isn&#8217;t just exclusive to facebook or any other type of social media. The author writes, “There has been considerable concern among parents, teachers, policy makers, and advocates about the nature and intensity of online social encounters among teens. The majority of teens have positive online experiences, but some are caught in an online feedback loop of meanness and negative experiences.” Cyber bullying can happen anywhere, to anyone, and at anytime. The dangers of social media will always be present as long as people continue to use it. Overall, I agree with everything the author says. Cyber bullying is a problem. I don’t think there is a way to stop it. I believe the only way to limit it, is to educate children about cyberbullying and the dangers of social media when used improperly.</span></p>
