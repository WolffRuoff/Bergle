			<p><em>Not all of Muhlenberg&#8217;s campus will be packing up and heading to McDaniel tomorrow &#8211; just most of the fall athletes. Except for football, the teams will be playing their Centennial Conference openers, so it&#8217;s a big day. Here&#8217;s a look at the matchups, in order of game time:</em></p>
<p><strong>Volleyball at McDaniel (Saturday, 12:00); vs. Goucher (Saturday, 2:00)</strong></p>
<p>Two teams on the rise will try to get a leg up on the CC season. McDaniel (3-6) has already surpassed its win total from all last season, when it went 0-25, and Muhlenberg (6-3) is closing in on its 2011 total of 10 wins. McDaniel leads the all-time series, 15-5, but the teams have split the last four years, with all of those matches ending in 3-0 sweeps.</p>
<p>live video: <a href="http://www.mcdanielathletics.tv/">http://www.mcdanielathletics.tv/</a></p>
<p><strong>Men&#8217;s Soccer at McDaniel (Saturday, 1:00)</strong></p>
<p>The regionally ranked Mules (3-1) rebounded from their first loss of the season to knock off Moravian, 5-0, on Wednesday. McDaniel is 2-3. Muhlenberg&#8217;s 31-7-1 all-time series lead includes a 16-2-1 mark in CC contests. The Mules are undefeated (9-0-1) in the last 10 meetings with the Green Terror, but from 2005 to 2009 the games were all decided by one goal, and the score was 2-0 the last two years.</p>
<p>live stats: <a href="http://www.mcdanielathletics.com/livestats/landing">http://www.mcdanielathletics.com/livestats/landing</a></p>
<p><strong>Football at McDaniel (Saturday, 2:00)</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg opened CC play with a 21-0 win against Franklin &amp; Marshall last week; McDaniel, the only winless school in the league, lost to Moravian, 21-7. Bair Stadium used to be a house of horrors for the Mules, who went from 1990 to 2006 without winning there, but they&#8217;ve captured their last two games in Westminster. The Green Terror leads the all-time series, 22-17-3.</p>
<p>Through two games, Muhlenberg leads the CC in pass efficiency (146.3 rating), while McDaniel is last in pass efficiency defense (164.8).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mcdanielathletics.com/livestats/landing">http://www.mcdanielathletics.com/livestats/landing</a></p>
<p><strong>Women&#8217;s Soccer at McDaniel (Saturday, 4:00)</strong></p>
<p>McDaniel is off to a 3-0 start for the first time in 10 seasons. Muhlenberg is 2-3-1 following Wednesday&#8217;s 3-0 loss to No. 4 Messiah. The Mules are 7-0-1 in their last eight games against the Green Terror with six straight wins.</p>

<p><strong>Field Hockey at McDaniel (Saturday, 6:30)</strong></p>
<p>The grand finale matches up two teams looking to return to the CC playoffs. Muhlenberg is 3-1 for the first time since 2007, when it last qualified for the playoffs, and received votes in the national poll. McDaniel is 3-2 and averaging 3.0 goals per game; the Mules have allowed only five goals in four games. Muhlenberg leads 10-9 in a series in which the road team has won the last three meetings.</p>

			<p><em>The second weekend of the 2012-13 athletic year features a volleyball tournament, a throwback soccer rematch, two spring teams opening up competition &#8230; and the football home opener with a coach going for a major milestone.</em></p>
<p><strong>Football vs. Franklin &amp; Marshall (Saturday, 1:00)</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-104" title="Mule Marquee Matchup" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="237" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg 350w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1-300x203.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" /></a>It&#8217;s the home opener for Muhlenberg and the Centennial Conference opener for both teams. The CC promises to be especially competitive this year after going 7-3 in non-conference games last week. Included in that record are the Mules&#8217; 27-7 win at The Apprentice School and the Diplomats&#8217; last-second 35-28 win against a Washington and Lee team that was 8-2 last year.</p>
<p>The defenses will be on alert to stop three hot quarterbacks. F&amp;M&#8217;s E.J. Schneider was named CC player of the week after throwing for 270 yards and rushing for 110, while Muhlenberg QBs Dan Deighan and Joe Carlucci combined to pass for 337 yards.</p>
<p>F&amp;M leads the all-time series, 52-42-1, although the Mules won last year&#8217;s matchup, 34-13.</p>
<p>Mule head coach Mike Donnelly enters the game with a career record of 99-61 and goes for his 100th win against John Troxell, who was his assistant at Muhlenberg for four years before taking the head reins at F&amp;M.</p>

<p><strong>Volleyball hosts Buttermaker Tournament (Friday vs. Centenary, 3:00; vs. King&#8217;s, 7:00; Saturday opponents TBD, 10:00 and 2:00)</strong></p>
<p>Coming off its rousing five-set win against DeSales on Wednesday, Muhlenberg hosts the 15th Buttermaker Tournament. The Mules (4-1) are seeking their first title since 2005. This year&#8217;s nine-team field includes defending champion Moravian as well as Salisbury, a team that went 32-4 last year and is currently receiving votes in the AVCA Division III poll.</p>

<p>One of the biggest wins in program history came in 1995, when the Mules beat Ithaca 4-0 in an NCAA quarterfinal game at Varsity Field to advance to the &#8220;Final Four.&#8221; Nothing of the sort is at stake here, although Muhlenberg (2-0) is ranked 11th in Division III. Ithaca is 1-1-1.</p>

			<p><em>With the spring sports season just about wrapped up, we will be taking a closer look at Muhlenberg’s senior student-athletes.</em></p>
<p><em>We continue with men’s tennis, which beat Ursinus, 5-4, in its Senior Day match. Seniors Jordan Rutt, Andrew Brod and Robert Buesser were honored before the match.</em></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/05/rutths1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1129" title="rutths" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/05/rutths1.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Jordan Rutt</strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s been your key to balancing tennis and school work to be named to the Centennial Conference Academic Honor Roll each of the last two seasons? </strong>I’ve always been a horrible procrastinator, so playing tennis and having even less time for schoolwork makes me focus really hard during crunch time. Luckily it’s worked out pretty well!<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What was it like studying abroad in the Netherlands during the fall of your junior year? </strong>Studying abroad was the experience of a lifetime, which is why I took 10,000 photos! I had never even been on a plane before, so leaving America and flying across the Atlantic to a new continent was a huge adjustment for me. I still can’t believe I got to see 11 countries, and I certainly want to travel again when I’m older.</p>
<p><strong>Are your parents going to go through withdrawal next year not having any Muhlenberg sporting events to attend for the first time in eight years? </strong>Yes, absolutely. It will be the first time one of their kids isn’t playing a sport in 20 years, and they have never missed a single tennis match throughout both high school and college! Luckily my sister coaches high school field hockey, so they can go watch her games.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What are some of the funniest moments from your time with the team? </strong>Burrito seshes, swum seshes, singing on the bus rides, Maestro (and Eli), and watching coach lather sunscreen on an umpire.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Do you have a favorite pro player? </strong>Rafael Nadal because of his athleticism and fighting spirit, and Maria Sharapova for obvious reasons.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What made you decide to major in economics and political science? </strong>When I was a freshman I was really interested in politics, but I knew I wanted and needed something else too. I thought I might enjoy a career in business, but I kind of liked math as well, so I chose economics. I don’t really care that much for politics anymore, so I’m glad I’ll have that econ degree!<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans? </strong>I’ll be looking for a job in business or statistics, and maybe one day if I somehow get super rich I’ll attempt to become a politician (but I doubt it). I also definitely want to coach tennis in the near future.</p>
<p><strong>What’s Andrew Brod like off the court? </strong>Brod’s an all-around great guy. He’s goofy, happy, funny, a conscientious student, and not to mention a good friend. I’ll miss him a lot next year, along with the entire team.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/05/brodhs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1122" title="brodhs" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/05/brodhs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Andrew Brod</strong></p>
<p><strong>What was it like getting to intern at the Library of Congress and with former Senator Arlen Specter the past two summers? </strong>… Hoping to learn more from government service work in D.C., I was selected for the 2011 Summer Junior Fellowship program at the Library of Congress. Assigned to the law division, I was able to hone my research and analytical skills by examining U.S. Court of Appeals records and briefs. After reviewing them, I docketed the briefs in a proprietary computer system so that they can be located if a lawyer or law clerk requests them. The fellowship was a great opportunity to whet my appetite for the study of law, particularly antitrust and consumer protection law, interests that stemmed from constituent phone calls in Senator Specter’s office. During my research, I came across a brief in a case involving an NFL antitrust claim in Joe Kapp v. National Football League. That case inspired me to research antitrust and sports contracts, including a specific provision in standard NFL player contracts, and I presented the findings in an exhibition at the Library of Congress. I performed a detailed search as if I were preparing to represent Joe Kapp directly. Researching the law and applying it to the circumstances of a potential case was exhilarating to me.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have any interesting or unique pre-match traditions or superstitions? </strong>I like to keep the same overgrip on my racquet until it rips off completely.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have a favorite pro player? </strong>Gael Monfils<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What made you decide to major in psychology and minor in political science? </strong>I have always been interested in the intersection of psychology and law. After exploring the various disciplines, I found that studying psychology allows students to think critically, especially while attempting to take different perspectives and understand theoretical constructs that define everyday behavior. I feel as though it has prepared me well to handle the rigors of the law school curriculum. <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans? </strong>I will be attending law school in the fall.</p>
<p><strong>What kind of person is Robert Buesser? </strong>Rob is a perseverant and overall stand-up guy who I’ve seen grow as a tennis player over the years. His enthusiasm is uncanny; he has a desire to constantly improve. It’s quite an admirable trait.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/05/buesserhs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1124" title="buesserhs" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/05/buesserhs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Robert Buesser</strong></p>
<p><strong>What made you decide to join the team as a sophomore? </strong>Originally, playing tennis in college didn’t really cross my mind freshman year. But I was encouraged to try out after a couple kids on the team saw me playing. So I decided to try out as a sophomore, and it’s been fun ever since. I guess it’s pretty cool to be a college tennis walk-on.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s the most memorable moment from your tennis career? </strong>The times in practice were actually the most fun, but I think the most memorable moment came this year against Gettysburg when Corey and I came back from down 6-3, 40-love all the way back to win 8-6. <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s your most memorable off-the-court moment or accomplishment from your time at Muhlenberg? </strong>I have had the opportunity to be the Mule at the Homecoming football game twice. That was one of the most fun and memorable experiences I can remember.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Do you have a favorite pro player? </strong>Probably Roger Federer. He is the most respectable player in tennis because he almost never complains. And because of the hard work he puts into his game, he makes every shot look easy.</p>
<p><strong>What made you decide to major in psychology and minor in Spanish? </strong>Coming into college, I always subconsciously knew that I would major in psychology. I have always found psychology interesting and applicable to everyday life. In addition, the professors from the psych department left a great impression on me, and I knew that psychology was for me. As for Spanish, I have always been naturally good at speaking the language. Also, I have taken Spanish since seventh grade, so I decided I should continue to study the language. Speaking Spanish is very important because in 20 or 30 years the majority of the nation will be Hispanic.</p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans? </strong>My future plans include: Visiting every continent as well as the moon, curing cancer, saving a beautiful woman from a fire then marrying her, then eventually becoming the town hero of Little Rock, Arkansas.</p>
<p><strong>What kind of teammate is Jordan Rutt? </strong>Jordan is a great teammate and captain. He legitimately cares and notices how you are playing and, of course, gives great pre-match speeches.</p>

			<p><em>With the spring sports season just about wrapped up, we will be taking a closer look at Muhlenberg’s senior student-athletes.</em></p>
<p><em>In the coming days, the MuhlBox will feature some of the highlights from the traditional senior question and answer profiles that run with the programs for Senior Day.</em></p>
<p><em>We start with women&#8217;s tennis, which beat Ursinus, 8-1, in its Senior Day match. Seniors Emily Robbins and Lauren Wink were honored before the match.</em></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/05/robbinshs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1112" title=" Emily Robbins" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/05/robbinshs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Emily Robbins<br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s the most memorable moment from your time with the tennis team? </strong>One of my favorite memories is a bus ride last year with the four seniors. They knew how to keep us all laughing, but get us ready for the match at the same time. I also enjoy our team dinners (especially at Wegmans) before important matches. 🙂<strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Who’s your favorite pro player? </strong>I love watching Roger Federer play because of how hard he works and his strategy in matches. I have seen him live a few times, and he is incredible.<strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>How have you been able to balance your time to make the Dean’s List the past two semesters? </strong>I really focus on my schoolwork and make that a priority. I enjoy spending time with my friends and family, which is also motivation for me to get my work done.<strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>What made you choose psychology as your major?</strong> I took Intro to Psychology with Dr. Rudski and was very intrigued by the information we were learning. I ended up finishing my major in three semesters because I enjoyed my psychology classes that much.<strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans?</strong> I intend to use the next year to do research and apply to graduate school in 2013 in neuropsychology to do concussion research.<strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>What kind of person is Lauren Wink?</strong> She works hard, but also knows how to have fun. She is a great friend and truly enjoys spending time with the team. Even though she’s student teaching this semester, she joins us at practice whenever she can, which shows her dedication.<strong></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/05/winkhs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1113" title="Lauren Wink" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/05/winkhs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Lauren Wink</strong></p>
<p><strong>What made you decide to join the team as a junior? </strong>My parents always told me to live my dreams. With their motivation and encouragement, I was able to work hard and join the team as a junior. I always played tennis with my family, but never competitively. I was an avid soccer player growing up, and unfortunately soccer and tennis were the same season in high school. The summer after I had back surgery, I shied away from competing in physical contact sports and increased my time spent playing tennis. It was at that time that I decided to take lessons and try out for the team at Muhlenberg. I thought it would be a good opportunity to become part of a team, which was a huge part of sports that I missed from playing varsity soccer and lacrosse in high school.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s your most memorable off-the-court moment or accomplishment from your time at Muhlenberg? </strong>I participated in the career center’s Senior Year Experience. As part of the three-day event, we were given a short cooking demonstration (because we all have to be prepared to cook in the real world!). Then at night we had a “Top Chef” competition. I was captain of my team; we were assigned the theme “mother-in-law is coming for dinner.” Two-and-a-half hours, a salad, a plate of spaghetti and meatballs, garlic bread and an elegant brownie dessert (with homemade whipped cream from Jordyn) later, we were selected as the “Top Chef” winners (shout out to Team Five!!!). It was a very fun event; they actually had chefs from local restaurants come in to judge all of the food! I am excited to see my name on the “Top Chef Winners” plaque hanging in the Wood Dining Commons!</p>
<p><strong>What made you decide to major in business administration while pursuing your elementary education certification? </strong>People always say, “So you want to teach business to kindergarteners?” I always knew I wanted to receive my certification in education, but after enjoying my economics class in high school, I decided to take one at Muhlenberg. I decided that a major in business would give me many options. I have enjoyed taking the diverse classes from my marketing concentration to my certification in elementary education. I’m still trying to brainstorm ways I can combine the two – maybe by being an administrator in a school in the future.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans? </strong>I plan on attending New York University in the fall to receive my master’s degree in literacy. After interning in New York last summer, I am very excited to have the opportunity to be there next year.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What kind of person is Emily Robbins?</strong> Emily actually moved into my hallway in the middle of sophomore year, but it was not until the summer before junior year that we actually spoke! When I was deciding to try out for the tennis team, I sent Emily an e-mail asking her what it was like being on the team. She gave me the rundown, and told me she loved the team and loved being able to play tennis every day. It is because of her that I decided to try out! She has been a very supportive teammate!<strong></strong></p>

			<p>It’s the middle of April – taxes are due, the Titanic has been down for 100 years, and even though softball and men&#8217;s lacrosse have the weekend off, there’s plenty of Muhlenberg sports action.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-104" title="Mule Marquee Matchup" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="237" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg 350w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1-300x203.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" /></a>Women’s Tennis vs. Washington (Friday, 3:30)</strong></p>
<p>Two teams that made the Centennial Conference playoffs last year are in a scramble to get back. Washington (5-3) and Muhlenberg (3-3) are in the middle of a five-team pack that includes Haverford (6-2), Dickinson (5-2) and Gettysburg (4-3). Those five teams are likely competing for three playoff spots, with Johns Hopkins and Swarthmore setting the pace at 6-0.</p>
<p>The Shorewomen are ranked eighth in the Atlantic South Region but have struggled since losing two of their top four players to injuries. Muhlenberg is coming off its most decisive win of the season, 8-1 against Ursinus.</p>
<p>Washington has won the last four meetings, including one in the 2009 CC playoffs. Last year’s 7-2 match featured many close sets.</p>
<p><strong>Tennis vs. Johns Hopkins (Saturday, 1:00); at McDaniel (Sunday, 12:00)</strong></p>
<p>A busy weekend of tennis for the Mules includes teams at opposite ends of the CC standings. For the women, Johns Hopkins is 6-0 in the CC and ranked eighth in Division III; McDaniel is 0-8 in the CC. For the men, 16th-ranked Hopkins is 6-0 and McDaniel is 0-5. The Muhlenberg men have not lost to McDaniel since 1982.</p>
<p><strong>Baseball vs. Swarthmore (Friday, 3:30); at Gettysburg (Saturday, 12:30 doubleheader)</strong></p>
<p>The Mules will try to halt their five-game skid at home against Swarthmore. Muhlenberg has not lost at home to the Garnet since 1995, extending the streak last year on a walkoff home run. The Mules then travel to Gettysburg, whom they swept last year.</p>

Muhlenberg beat Washington, 8-4, in the first game of the playoffs en route to the CC championship last year. The teams split in the regular season. The Shorewomen are off to a 4-0 start in CC play, while the Mules are 2-0.</p>

<p>Gettysburg did not make the CC playoffs last year but is traditionally one of the strongest teams in the league, and one that gives Muhlenberg a hard time. The Mules have never swept the Bullets in a regular-season doubleheader, and they haven&#8217;t won a game at Gettysburg since 2000.</p>

<p>The 16-6 Mules, who received 11 votes in this week&#8217;s D3baseball.com poll, look to continue their winning ways with three CC games and one non-league contest. Coming off Tuesday&#8217;s 11-5 win at Ursinus, Muhlenberg will try to complete its first season sweep of the Bears on Friday.</p>

The Mules, who have scored in double figures in 13 of their 22 games, will try to solve a McDaniel pitching staff that has a sparkling 2.40 ERA.</p>

<p><strong>Men&#8217;s Golf at McDaniel Spring Invitational (Saturday and Sunday)</strong></p>

<p>Szulman went a perfect 3-0 in singles play without dropping a set and added a doubles win for the Mules. The sophomore only dropped three games at No. 2 singles to help the Mules pick up their first CC win over Bryn Mawr on Friday. Szulman followed that up with a dominating 6-4, 6-0 singles win at Gettysburg on Saturday.</p>

<p>Rosen batted .500 with six runs scored, four RBI, two doubles and a triple in four games for the Mules. The sophomore also walked once and was hit once for a .571 on-base percentage. Rosen, who had an RBI in every game he played during the week, reached base five times, stole his first career base and scored four runs in the 16-3 win over Albright on Thursday.</p>

Enjoy!</p>
<p><strong>Men&#8217;s Lacrosse vs. Franklin &amp; Marshall (Saturday, 7:00)</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg will be collecting food items and donations for the Second Harvest Food Bank at this game. Most food shelters receive plenty of donations around the holiday season. It is right around spring time when their supplies run out, so this is a very important time to give.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-104" title="Mule Marquee Matchup" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1-300x203.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="203" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1-300x203.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Do not expect the spirit of giving to carry over to the lacrosse field. Centennial Conference games are usually closely contested, and these two teams have taken that to an extreme, going to double overtime last year and triple overtime in 2008 and 2010. Those three games were all in Lancaster; the last meeting in Allentown was a relative blowout, with Muhlenberg winning 10-8.</p>
<p>It could be another close one. Although the Mules come in 2-4 and the Diplomats 5-1 and receiving votes in the national poll, both teams played at Susquehanna with similar results: Muhlenberg won 9-7, and F&amp;M won 9-8 in overtime.</p>

<p><strong>Women&#8217;s Lacrosse vs. Franklin &amp; Marshall (Saturday, 1:00)</strong></p>
<p>As close as the men&#8217;s series with F&amp;M has been, the women&#8217;s has gone the other way. The Mules are winless in 28 all-time games against the Diplomats, but they will try to change that after getting off to a 3-0 start.</p>
<p>F&amp;M (3-1), which won national championships in 2007 and 2009, is tied for eighth in the Division III poll.</p>
