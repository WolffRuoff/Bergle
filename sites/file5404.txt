								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was originally cast in the Sedehi Diversity Project as an alternate, but on July 19th, two days before the cast was set to move in, I was asked to join the ensemble. I spent the summer mostly just trying to get my dog to give me the time of day, but two days later I was back in Allentown to take part in the project!</p>
<p>It was a little scary to leave so abruptly and be among a bunch of mostly upperclassmen who I had never met. They were all very welcoming and caught me up on all the preparations they did during the year. In transcribing the interviews and compiling the script, I learned a lot from other members of the community’s perspectives. I enjoyed including my own perspective as the only wheelchair using students on campus, too.</p>
<p>I think the project is important because it gives the incoming freshmen a raw and realistic glimpse into our community. It tells the truth: it’s not perfect, it’s not built for everyone, but there is unity and hope for the future. I was very impressed and moved by it when I saw it my freshman year, almost one year ago. Some people might take the wrong message from the project. They might interpret it as a warning filled with horror stories and regret their decision in coming to Muhlenberg. The point of the project is to inspire the new generation in the community to be the change they want to see in Muhlenberg and in the world. I’m very lucky to be part of such an important piece, and look forward to sharing it with the community!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello blog readers!! My name is Bree, and I&#8217;m this year’s student director! It has been a great experience being able to be a part of this project for the second year in a row. The ensemble has been putting in major work, and so has our wonderful project manager, Mikaela! With that, reflecting on my time with these concepts and themes has allowed for the opportunity, to again, expand my thinking on what is diversity. I think the election served as a good focal point to get these conversations started because it was an event that we all could ground ourselves in, despite our <em>differences</em>. [differences is italicized because I think it&#8217;s also equally as important to recognize how certain bodies are affected more than others.]
<p>The first few weeks of being together as an ensemble has allotted a lot of time to think about how grievances impact our understanding of diversity, specifically on Muhlenberg&#8217;s campus. After going through interviews and finishing the first few drafts of the script, we continue to grapple with how important it is to give space to those grievances as well as space for them to be answered the duration of the show&#8211;</p>
<p>Which brings me back to my original point of differences. While it may be true that we should “unite despite our differences,” I think it&#8217;s important to understand why it may be easier for certain bodies to take on this politic, without fully grasping why it may be harder for a marginalized body to get onboard at the same speed. In order to ensure this full fledging of <i>allyship</i>, there must first be a concerted effort to make all spaces, environments, institutions, etc. fully <b>equitable</b> as opposed to just <b>equal</b>.</p>
<p>I am so excited for the freshman and everyone else to see the show! Be on the lookout for more updates from ensemble members.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the first round of interviews my idea of what diversity is has definitely expanded. I can perceive diversity as being, not only different races, genders and sexualitites, but also different thoughts and ideologies. Furthermore, through interacting with the cast while also going through the interviews I have a new sense of knowledge about body ability/disability, as well as mental capacity. When having conversations about diversity and inclusion it’s important to note and acknowledge all elements of diversity, aka intersectionality. My first year was important for me in recognizing all facets of my identity that affect me being a student at Muhlenberg. Having a strong sense of self is also important in attempting to have a successful career at Muhlenberg, especially as a student of color. How these different aspects of my identity are supported and reflected on campus is another topic I’m still exploring, especially being a part of this cast. This journey is blossoming into a wonderful learning and growing experience.</span></p>
