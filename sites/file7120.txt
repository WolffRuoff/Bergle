<p>The Tour Guide program at Muhlenberg is a volunteer position for the Office of Admissions. You have to interview to get in, and then if accepted you are in the program for the rest of your time at Muhlenberg. I have been a tour guide since my second semester freshman year, and it is one of my favorite jobs. As a tour guide I train how to give tours tailored to the interest of the person or people on the tour. It has given me a lot of practice in sales and communication. I have had great success in being a tour guide and am proud to say that since I started giving tours 10 current students at Muhlenberg told me that the tour I gave helped influence their decision to come to Muhlenberg.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Tour Guide Exec</li>
</ul>
<p>I had two main responsibilities as a Tour Guide Exec. The first was to train the new tour guides who come in January how to give tours, and then test and clear them to give tours themselves after training. I also keep up to date with them to help handle any scheduling issues they may have during the year. My other responsibility was specific to my position on Exec Board which was recruitment chair. I was tasked with keeping interest up all year long to get people to apply for new tour guide positions in the fall. In my one year as recruitment chair I brought in almost 300 applications to the tour guide office.</p>

Not only have I learned how to be responsible for myself, but also the people on the team with me. There are always different levels of skill on a track team and one of the most important jobs a teammate has is being able to keep everyone together and build unity. I am also lucky to have been a captain not once but twice in my track career and teach new people on the team how to organize themselves for practice, carry out workouts, and incorporate them into the team culture.</p>

<p>As President of ATO my job is to be the liaison between the chapter, Muhlenberg, and the national fraternity. This involves a great deal of organizational skills, maintaining positive relationships with all offices on campus, and creating positive involvement for the chapter on campus. I work together with the executive board and the chapter to plan events on campus to get the fraternity involved with more than just ourselves. I have learned a great deal about myself as a leader, and how to build a team of people from all types of backgrounds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Membership Education Chairman</li>
</ul>
<p>As Membership Education Chairman  of ATO, it was my job to teach all new members about the values of ATO and show them our history. I also was tasked with creating team building activities to bring the new members closer to the entire fraternity and with the older brothers. Once the new members are initiated, I focus on bringing in educational programs for the entire chapter to participate in such as different guest lecturers. Some of the lectures we had last year involved a speech on bystander intervention from Campus Safety, a professional development lesson from the Career Center, and a talk on the importance of mental health in correlation with team dynamic from the Counseling Center.</p>
