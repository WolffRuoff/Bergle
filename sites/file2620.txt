Retrieved from <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/kings-speech-pg-13-version-171129">http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/kings-speech-pg-13-version-171129</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Kin<a href="http://mediaindustries11.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/03/The-Kings-Censored-Speech.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-972" src="http://mediaindustries11.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/03/The-Kings-Censored-Speech-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a>g&#8217;s Speech,&#8221; the most recent winner of the Academy Award for Best Picture, will undergo a ratings facelift on Friday, April 1. The Weinstein Co., the film&#8217;s distributing studio, announced that they will replace all R-rated prints of the film currently in theaters with a brand new PG-13 version. Starting next Friday, this teen-friendly version of the film will play in approximately 1,000 theaters nationwide. This is the first time a film has been released in theaters with a new rating since 1978&#8217;s &#8220;Saturday Night Fever,&#8221; although in the case of that film, the new PG version (downgraded from R) was released in theaters months later. In the case of &#8220;The King&#8217;s Speech,&#8221; which is still playing in wide release, the studio is simply pulling the current R-rated version from theaters and replacing all prints with this new PG-13 version. The Motion Picture Association of America, which is responsible for designating the ratings of films, originally gave &#8220;The King&#8217;s Speech&#8221; an R rating for &#8220;some language.&#8221; The reedited PG-13 version is so rated because of &#8220;language.&#8221; In the PG-13 cut, numerous uses of the &#8220;F-bomb&#8221; have either been muted or replaced with &#8220;s*it.&#8221;<span id="more-970"></span></p>
<p>In late February, MPAA chair Bob Pisnano and NATO (National Association of Theater Owners) president John Fithian co-signed a waiver permitting the Weinstein Co. to release this new version <em>without</em> the standard provision that it be released 90 days after the R-rated version was pulled from theaters. Prior to a few years ago, the possibility of this waiver did not exist, so &#8220;The King&#8217;s Speech&#8221; is the first time the waiver has been employed by a film studio. It seems clear the Weinstein Co. has made the effort to release a PG-13 version of the film in hopes of attracting more widespread revenue. An R rating limits film patrons under the age of 17 to only being sold a ticket when in the presence of a parent or guardian. With a PG-13 rating, however, no age limit exists in terms of ticket sales.</p>
<p>This re-rating seems to indicate the tremendous power role that the studio holds. It seems that, at least in this particular case, the studio is more interested in obtaining as much profit as possible rather than the film&#8217;s art. Not only did &#8220;The King&#8217;s Speech&#8221; receive extensive critical acclaim and win the Best Picture Oscar in its original form, but it also was very successful financially (the film has grossed $132.7 million in the United States already). From a logical standpoint, there seems to be no reason for the existence of the PG-13 version. The subject matter of &#8220;The King&#8217;s Speech&#8221; is inherently adult and, at least on first glance, it doesn&#8217;t seem like allowing teenagers to see the film unaccompanied will really change the film&#8217;s fortunes a considerable amount. The DVD is also scheduled for release on April 19, less than three weeks after the PG-13 re-release, perhaps further muting box office returns. The Weinstein Co.&#8217;s actions could have extensive repercussions throughout the film industry. If the PG-13 re-release of the film is at all successful, it may give studios incentives to lobotomize the content of future films in order to gain more audience-friendly ratings. What&#8217;s more, this issue seems to be stirring a debate regarding the preservation of the film&#8217;s original content. The filmmakers of &#8220;The King&#8217;s Speech&#8221; intended for the film to be seen in its original R rating, and some have spoken out against changing the film&#8217;s content, such as the film&#8217;s star Geoffrey Rush. Our group believes this change in the film&#8217;s rating to be some  &#8220;bull&#8230;&#8221; Censorship should not stand, and filmmakers should be able to have their content embraced by audiences in the way dictated by the creators themselves, not the studios.</p>

<p>As busy college students, many of us find it difficult to sit down to watch our favorite shows when they originally air. That’s what makes a website like <a href="http://www.hulu.com/">Hulu</a> so convenient—this online television option makes it easy to catch up on <em>Glee</em> or <em>The Office</em> in between classes (or parties).  Also attractive to college students is the fact that Hulu is free, as the site earns its money from advertisers rather than from users.  While Hulu is fantastic for busy TV fans, it is not necessarily ideal for television networks—while the networks are given a share of Hulu’s advertising revenue, some have deemed this percentage inadequate (check out this <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/03/business/media/03hulu.html?scp=1&amp;sq=hulu%20and%20comedy%20central&amp;st=Search"><em>New York Times</em> article</a>, which describes Comedy Central’s grievances with and temporary departure from Hulu).   Adding to the industry’s woes is the difficulty of measuring ratings from Hulu, which is also tied to profits, as networks use ratings as a resource to lure advertisers.  This dilemma was the topic of this &#8220;State of the TV Industry&#8221; panel at the February 15th TV Summit, an event hosted by the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences Foundation and <em>Variety</em>.</p>
<p><span id="more-892"></span></p>
<p>Television distribution has become extremely fragmented, providing audiences with a choice of where and how to watch TV shows.  Much like Tivo, a site like Hulu acts as a distributor that, in many ways, empowers audiences:  viewers aren’t bound to network-determined schedules and can watch their favorite shows when they want, free of charge.  The television industry’s effort to monetize this online content, a goal expressed by several members of the “State of the TV Industry” panel, creates a bit of a power struggle between audience and producer, with the distributor, Hulu, in the position of middleman with the ability to direct the flow of power.   However, the networks have some muscle when dealing with Hulu as they control a resource that is absolutely crucial to Hulu’s operation: content.  If a network is not satisfied with Hulu’s method of compensation, the network can simply withdraw its content from the site, which could cost Hulu viewers, and, as a result, money from advertisers.  Taking this power structure into consideration, we anticipate that Hulu will eventually shift into a completely subscription-based system (the site did recently add a premium option, <a href="http://www.hulu.com/plus">Hulu Plus</a>, which cost users $7.99 a month) in order to boost the percentage of its profits that it directs to the participating networks, which will ensure that these networks continue to provide Hulu with the content the site needs to hold onto audiences.</p>
<p>While much of the TV Summit discussion centered on the necessity of making a profit from online content, some panelists were more concerned with the quality of the content itself, with some industry insiders emphasizing the importance of inspired writers and emotionally-gripping story lines.  But when it comes to the issue of monetizing online television, it will be producers and investors, rather than TV writers or creators, who will exercise the most influence over this technological and financial issue.  However, if the networks’ monetization dreams do come true, audiences will, hopefully, demand top-notch quality if we’re asked to pay top-dollar to watch TV online.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jack, M., &amp; Hudson, J. (2011, Jan. 31). LX New York is Alive at Five. <em>Broadcasting &amp; Cable, (141,5).</em> Retrieved from <a href="http://0-web.ebscohost.com.library.muhlenberg.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?hid=8&amp;sid=f5b72ee7-0ab7-4b24-879e-1f00d0d749ae%40sessionmgr11&amp;vid=4" target="_blank">http://0-web.ebscohost.com.library.muhlenberg.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?hid=8&amp;sid=f5b72ee7-0ab7-4b24-879e-1f00d0d749ae%40sessionmgr11&amp;vid=4</a></p>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://assets.nydailynews.com/img/2010/04/06/alg_lx_new_york2.jpg" alt="" width="257" height="176" /></p>
<p>Hoping to interest a new target audience, WMBC New York executives created the 60-minute news program <em>LX New York</em>, which airs daily at 5:00 pm. At first, ratings were less than impressive. As a result, the creators decided to implement some key changes to the show&#8217;s format. These changes were linked to another decision: WMBC executives decided to specifically target suburban women.  To increase show ratings and appeal to these viewers, <em>LX New York</em> started utilizing the city more.  For example, the show began airing cooking segments filmed on the city streets and in local restaurants instead of in the studio. The new and improved <em>LX New York</em> also features celebrity interviews, cooking segments,news snippets, and a topic of the day.</p>
<p><span id="more-823"></span>Additionally, executives brought on a new host, former news anchor Jane Hanson.  By serving as a familiar face, Hanson comes with her own fans, thus, brings more viewers to<em> LX New York</em>.  Producers also created a social media campaign, which included an online, live viewer chat about the show. Specifically, the online resources and viewer chats act as a linking pin for <em>LX New York</em>, an example of a symbiotic relationship between television and internet. Most importantly,the live chats provide a sense of community for fans, forming personal ties and relationship to the show while also providing feedback to producers.  That way, both audiences and producers benefit and gain a sense of power.<br />
<!--more--><br />
However, WMCS and viewers are not the only parties benefitting from the revamped <em>LX New York</em>.  A unique way the show presents its advertisers is through integration into segments, which would not be done in a newscast. For instance, the grocery store chain, Fairway, has sponsored cooking bits. This unique kind of advertising is enticing for advertisers since the product is actually integrated into the program, as opposed to using commercials, which can be bypassed.  This is especially relevant in the age of changing television exhibition, with technologies such as Tivo allowing viewers to simply fast-forward through commercials.</p>
<p>Competitors are thrilled with WMBC’s New York’s change because the new program does not target a news audience anymore, even though it is running during a timeslot traditionally reserved for news programs.  Of course, if the show does too well, it could spawn imitators, which could lead to the replacement of serious news with soft entertainment—a potentially dangerous transition for a democratic society that relies on an informed citizenry.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lafayette, J.  (2011, February 1). MTV’s ‘Skins’ Continues Ratings Slide Except with Teens.  <em>Broadcasting &amp; Cable</em>. Retrieved from <a href="http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/463300-MTV_s_Skins_Continues_Ratings_Slide_Except_with_Teens.php">http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/463300-MTV_s_Skins_Continues_Ratings_Slide_Except_with_Teens.php</a>.</p>
<p>The new MTV show <em><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=skins+us+trailer&amp;aq=f">Skins</a>,</em> a program that depicts (quite explicitly) “the sex and drug habits of teens,” is already facing pressure from audiences and advertisers, even though the show has only aired three episodes.  Although MTV aims its programming towards the 12-34 year old demographic, <em>Skins</em> has been wildly popular with 12-17 year olds (omg!), which is troubling for many parents.  One major media advocacy organization, The Parents Television Council, labeled <em>Skins</em> the “’&#8217;most dangerous show&#8217; on TV for children.&#8221;  Even Viacom, which owns MTV, has acknowledged these concerns, suggesting the show may, in fact, violate child pornography laws.  This negative attention has also worried advertisers, many of whom have opted to remove their advertisements from MTV during <em>Skins&#8217; </em>time slot.</p>
<p><span id="more-731"></span>The outcry over <em>Skins</em> complicates that old media adage that sex sells.  <em>Skins</em>’ racy content has upset public advocacy groups, which have significant power to shape television programming.  While we often think of government regulation as the key way to address questionable media content, this example suggests that public advocacy organizations can also be effective by encouraging media producers to self-regulate.  As a public advocacy group, the PTC has the ability to draw negative attention to <em>Skins</em>, increasing the likelihood that other parents will think twice before allowing their own kids to watch the program.  Plus, networks know that if they fail to listen to advocacy groups&#8217; concerns, these groups can turn to the government to secure mandated content regulation.   These two resources, publicity and the threat of government-regulation, give advocacy groups like the PTC an edge when dealing with media producers like MTV, and could very well persuade MTV to dial back on <em>Skins</em>&#8216; adult content.</p>
<p>In addition to the PTC, many advertisers have also objected to<em> Skins</em>.  Not wanting to be associated with an increasingly stigmatized show, General Motors, Taco Bell, Schick, Subway, Wrigley, and H&amp;R Block have all removed their ads during <em>Skins</em>’ time slot.  Other sponsors who had secured product placement deals with MTV, including Clearasil, are also considering withdrawing their involvement with <em>Skins. </em>So, advertisers, which fill the power role of client, can also use their resources to motivate television networks to self-regulate their content.   When a client like Subway withdraws its ads from MTV during <em>Skins</em>&#8216; time slot, this is an example of a client exercising its power, or strategically withholding its resources.  As television networks rely on money from advertisers, MTV, again, has an interest in self-regulating its controversial material in order to hold onto advertisers and the money that they control.</p>
<p>Whether you think the uproar over <em>Skins</em> represents a move towards a sensible solution or senseless censorship, one thing’s for sure: the <strong>ombudspeople</strong> at MTV must be very busy.</p>
