					<description><![CDATA[There&#039;s definitely a trend to your posts, Group 2!  Satellite radio is an interesting case for the radio industry, since it utilizes a totally different method of distribution for the audio signal (that is, satellite signals rather than radio waves over the air).  As you write these posts, I would definitely like to see you grapple with the power roles structure here.  In essence, since the buyout of XM by Sirius, there is only one monopoly supplier of satellite radio subscription in the U.S.  How does this affect the market?  Additionally, think about a subscription vs. an advertiser-supported model for radio - what are the pros and cons of each for consumers or the concentration of power in the industry?  These are some things you might want to think about a you prepare for your group presentation as well as for your individual papers.]]></description>
