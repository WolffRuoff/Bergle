Kan, M. April 27, 2011. China&#8217;s Baidu Revenue, Profits Up on Strong Traffic Growth.<em> Network World</em>. Retried from <a href="http://www.networkworld.com/news/2011/042811-chinas-baidu-revenue-profits-up.html">http://www.networkworld.com/news/2011/042811-chinas-baidu-revenue-profits-up.html</a></p>
<p>Google dominants search in nearly every corner of the world, except in one: China. Google’s forays into the lucrative Chinese internet search marketplace, which is estimated at 457 million users, have captured less than 20% of the market. Baidu, an eleven year old competitor, offers many similar services to those provided by Google, yet has gained a significant market share by leveraging linking pin power roles. For instance, Baidu is the “default search engine in 80 percent of Andriod phones in China&#8230;because the mobile operating system is open-source software, device manufactures can make changes to it.” Baidu is pre-installed on devices through revenue sharing agreements with manufacturers.</p>
<p><span id="more-1182"></span></p>
<p>Baidu’s power as a exhibitor in the Chinese search market exceeds that of Google in the Unted States (approx. 65%), and rivals Google’s dominance in Europe (closer to 80%). This runs in paradox to the belief that American media power tends to be more concentrated than the European media system. The internet industry differs in this regard from traditional media. One reason may be the entrepreneurial spirit in the United States encourages more imitators and competitors; backed by venture capital firms (an important investor power role in the internet industry) that provide billions of dollars annually to internet start ups.</p>

(2011, 3 April). Company bets we&#8217;ll listen to a &#8216;celestial jukebox&#8217;. <em>IndyStar Business and Technology</em> Retrieved From <a href="http://www.indystar.com/article/20110403/BUSINESS06/304030004/1281/BUSINESS06">http://www.indystar.com/article/20110403/BUSINESS06/304030004/1281/BUSINESS06<br />
</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are we beginning to count on the Internet for everything?  Not only are we beginning to rely on our music playlists created on online streaming cloud-based sites, but the founders of Skype are betting on our usual creation of playlists created in iTunes, are moving to &#8216;<a href="http://www.indystar.com/article/20110403/BUSINESS06/304030004/1281/BUSINESS06">celestial jukeboxes</a>&#8216; listened to through the Internet.  These internet radio stations, and cloud-based playlist options, are becoming new distributors for artists&#8217; music.  We aren&#8217;t completely forgetting about terrestrial radio in cars, and on systems in the house, but when people are choosing to listen to these internet streams they immediately think, well&#8230; can I play this in my car? Around the house?  In the bathroom?  And with the emergence of new technologies that support the access of these internet &#8220;user-created&#8221; stations and playlists, industries of many different types want to get their feet in the door.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span id="more-1043"></span></p>
<p>Linking with the music industry, radio is now becoming an on-demand service.  Listeners are able to pick their music, and if they have the technologies acquired for listening to their music, they will be more than willing to do so.  The automobile industry, smartphone industry, and the television industry are all becoming exhibitors and distributors for this idea of the &#8221; &#8216;celestial jukebox&#8217; of the Internet, allowing listeners to play virtually any song, any time, anywhere, through a variety of Internet-linked devices.&#8221;  Not only do we see the Internet becoming a huge producer and distributor for the internet radio, its facilitation is allowing for extreme variety when it comes to listening to music.</p>
<p>This is extremely threatening to FM/AM radio.  Those who will have access to these streaming sites will begin to acknowledge the fact that they are willing to pay a subscription fee/month to be able to listen to any music of their choice.  Instead of turning on the radio, hearing the same 20 songs played by the hour, and listening to boring, ever-lasting advertisements, they can subscribe to the internet radio sites, create their own playlists, and enjoy the music that they want to hear.  Some of these cloud-based sites aren&#8217;t subscription based yet, so they still need the support of the advertising power role, but in time they will build up to being subscription based.</p>
<p>&#8220;<a href="http://mog.com/">Mog</a> and <a href="http://www.rdio.com/">Rdio</a> offer subscribers unlimited access for a set monthly fee &#8212; $9.99 for both companies. For that amount, subscribers can select any song from a catalog of 8 million to 10 million tunes and listen through any device connected to the Internet.&#8221;  These are other Internet radio sites like Pandora and Slacker radio, and are giving people the chance of unlimited access for a small fee.  These sites can be accessed in the car, on a smartphone, and even on the television. &#8221; For times they lack an Internet connection, subscribers can store songs to a phone or laptop, music they can use as long as they subscribe.&#8221;  This is an extremely important feature because I&#8217;m sure the client-based roles were concerned with this aspect.  Not only could this bump out iTunes as a music distributor and exhibitor, but it can also knock out mp3&#8217;s and CD&#8217;s.  All in all, the internet is beginning to control not only social life, but how we now listen to music, and understand radio.  We don&#8217;t envision radio as talkshows, or advertisements anymore, because we have the ability to create the music played for us on &#8220;our&#8221; own, creator made radio stations.</p>

Retrieved from <a href="http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/industry/digital-and-mobile/amazon-beats-apple-and-google-to-the-cloud-1005098372.story">http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/industry/digital-and-mobile/amazon-beats-apple-and-google-to-the-cloud-1005098372.story</a></p>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://cdn.pocket-lint.com/images/zYQm/amazon-cloud-drive-streams-in-1.jpg?20110329-123718" alt="" width="221" height="137" />The last decade has witnessed fierce competition between media companies whose products were initially quite different. <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a>, that little search engine that could in the nineties, today locks horns with <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> in the Internet TV and music exhibition market. Now <a href="http://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a>, that erstwhile book distributor, has announced that it, too, is joining the digital music fray. In a move that will <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/apr/03/john-naughton-amazon-cloud-drive-google-sony">light a fire under product developers</a> at Apple and Google, Amazon announced the debut of its new digital music service <a href="https://www.amazon.com/clouddrive/learnmore/ref=sa_menu_acd_lrn2">Cloud Drive</a>, which allows users to share their own music across computers through the Internet (the “cloud”). And, true to form, the recording companies are already finding reasons to go berserk about it.</p>
<p><span id="more-1024"></span></p>
<p>Amazon, of course, has been both exhibiting and distributing music for years. The new service will make Amazon a facilitator, as well. Users will be able to create an Amazon account, upload existing music files or buy MP3s right from Amazon, and access that music on any Internet-capable computer. By facilitating users’ storage of existing MP3s, Amazon obviously hopes to draw more users into its own MP3 store in an imitation of Apple’s<a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/"> iTunes</a> success. The company even offers discounts on storage space based on the number of MP3s the user buys directly from Amazon. And why shouldn’t they buy? One digital copy of a song is about the same as any other, and Amazon’s MP3s can live on the Internet instead of just one computer. All the people who lost their entire iTunes library when attempting to transfer it from one computer to another should take note.</p>
<p>It looks like Amazon may actually make some money off of this. And wherever you find an outside company profiting from a music service, you find the <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-31001_3-20048499-261.html">major record labels preparing to sue them</a>. The exact details of the labels’ problem with the service are a bit sketchy, but the main concern is a new form of P2P file sharing. Cloud Drive technically only allows users to share music with themselves on different digital platforms, but if one user uploads thousands of songs and then starts selling their Cloud Drive password for $50 a pop, a nightmare could ensue for the recording industry.</p>
<p>The record labels, possibly weary of dragging all of the world’s 7 billion people through the U.S. legal system, have indicated that they’re willing to drop the issue if Amazon re-buys the licenses for the songs they distribute through Cloud Drive, thereby reducing the financial impact of possible mass file sharing. So far, Amazon has adamantly refused. They claim that they are simply providing users with an online external hard drive. The recording companies have pointed out that it’s much easier to share music online than through a physical hard drive, but Amazon argues that the two are legally the same.</p>
<p>In addition to the labels’ lust for making users pay every time two notes of a song hit their ears, Amazon must also find ways to compete with Google and Apple, who are already calling Cloud Drive an inferior product. Google’s upcoming digital music service has hit legal challenges from the labels before it even debuted, but Google claims it’s working through the challenges while developing features for users that will easily out-compete Cloud Drive, including easy ways to store video and photos as well as music. Amazon, for its part, is basking in the glow of both upstaging the record labels and being the first in the new market.</p>
<p>Only time will tell whether all digital content—music, video, etc.—will migrate to the cloud during the next few years, but with almost all the major technology companies developing cloud-driven products, it certainly seems likely. The recording companies may need to be dragged, kicking and screaming, into this future. Now that other companies are finding ways to let users expand their digital music options, the labels will have to continue finding ways to continue profiting from their products. That is the industry’s current challenge.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bruno, A. (16 March 2011). MTV launches Hive website, latest effort to refocus on music. <em>Billboard</em>. Retrieved from <a href="http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/industry/digital-and-mobile/mtv-launches-hive-website-latest-effort-1005075732.story#">http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/industry/digital-and-mobile/mtv-launches-hive-website-latest-effort-1005075732.story#</a></p>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/photos/stylus/1037809-MTV-Hive.png" alt="" width="200" height="140" />The empty acronym formerly known as Music Television (MTV) debuted a new website this week that focuses on…music. The new site, called “<a href="http://www.mtvhive.com/">Hive</a>,” will feature music videos, interviews, book reviews by artists, polls, music popularity tracking meters, and editorials by the company’s top executives. It appears to represent an effort by MTV to reinvent its image after recent Reality- show scandals, including a child pornography investigation surrounding its shock-schlock show <em>Skins</em>.</p>
<p><span id="more-955"></span></p>
<p>MTV wasn’t always a Reality TV depot. At its peak, MTV was one of the most important exhibitors in the music industry. Eighties and nineties kids often heard new music for the first time on the network’s popular request shows, and MTV’s decision to promote or marginalize a new artist could make or break a recording company’s profits for an entire year. The network also transformed the music video into a form of mass media, forcing the labels to dump millions of dollars a year into producing high-quality and catchy videos for audiences.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, over a decade after jumping onto the Reality TV bandwagon, MTV apparently wants to recapture some of its former image (and power). The network will exhibit music on the site, with a section for users to access new and vintage music videos and buy MP3s. Alongside the actual music will be polls that track users’ opinions of new artists, videos that feature <a href="http://www.mtvhive.com/playlists/76BA27020227BA7600010227BA76/mgid:playlist:video:mtvmusic.com:71585">sometimes bizarre</a> consumer reviews of music videos, and a feature called <a href="http://www.mtvmusicmeter.com/">Music Meter</a>, which claims to track an artists’ popularity on social media and downloading sites. MTV’s many Top Ten countdowns and on-air VJ reviews made it a facilitator for the music industry since its inception, and network executives are clearly hoping to carry that role online. To help with the transition, the network is bringing in veteran music industry linking pin Jessica Robertson, who helped <em><a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/">Rolling Stone</a> </em>and <em><a href="http://www.spinner.com/">Spinner</a></em> digitize and re-format their content for the Internet age.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In some ways, it’s surprising that MTV waited so long to overhaul its website. This is the network that has exploited almost every synergistic media connection possible, from television series to a movie division. Now that MTV is finally ready to “flex some music muscles,” as network president Van Toffler says, it may already be too late. MTV’s core demographic, the teen to twenties group, has been getting MP3s and music news online from sources that look suspiciously like MTV’s new website, including <a href="http://www.billboard.com/#/">Billboard</a>, for over a decade. Hive will have to include some outstanding features to draw users away from their established online music outlets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One notable feature of the site is the complete lack of traditional “advertising.” Of course, that’s largely because the site is one big advertisement for all artists whose labels have made deals with MTV to sell merchandise, concert tickets, and MP3s on the site, along with other promotion deals. In fact, the same criticisms that the network faced at its peak are likely to carry over to the new website. For years, critics argued that MTV was the prime homogenization force in the music industry, squeezing out smaller artists whose indie labels couldn’t pay to make high-profile deals with the network. It’s not hard to imagine that any concert tickets or merchandise sold on Hive won’t be for your local neighborhood ska band’s next gig. It’s not really that MTV doesn’t like indie artists. MTV has a bottom line to worry about, and music and promotion deals with Sony and EMI are more likely to increase it than smaller labels.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, it’s not really MTV doing all these things at all. MTV is actually owned by <a href="http://www.viacom.com/Pages/default.aspx">Viacom</a>, a massive media conglomerate that owns a number of television channels (including Nickelodeon) and a diversified portfolio of other media holdings. Viacom is interested in promoting the same content across multiple channels and making deals with reliable companies who they know will follow through on their commitments. Large national corporations don’t necessarily have time to deal with the eccentric smaller indie labels. MTV probably initially jumped into bed with Viacom because it couldn’t afford to do that, either. Like most things, it all comes down to money.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MTV apparently hopes to offer more local music listings and services in the future, but there’s no trace of those features on Hive. As the Internet becomes the primary exhibition and distribution outlet for music, corporations like MTV that specialize in music may eventually have to “own the local” in much the same way newspapers and radio stations had to with the advent of television. It’s too early to tell whether Hive will allow MTV to re-enter some of its former power roles in the music industry. Given Viacom’s financial backing, however, the network certainly has a fighting chance.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Powers, Lindsay. (2011, February 17). Redbox taking on netflix with new digital streaming movie service. <em>The Hollywood Reporter</em>.   Retrieved from <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/redbox-taking-netflix-new-digital-100543" target="_blank">http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/redbox-taking-netflix-new-digital-100543</a>.<a href="http://mediaindustries11.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/02/gamefly-redbox.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-843" src="http://mediaindustries11.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/02/gamefly-redbox-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a></p>
<p>In an era when media industries must constantly adapt to developing technologies and consumer desires, DVD rental company Redbox will soon be making technology-based improvements in an effort to compete with its rival Netflix. Redbox, known for its compact, bright red kiosks stationed by grocery store and gas station exits, works by vending DVDs to customers at a rate of $1 per day via credit card. According to Redbox president Mitch Lowe, the company will begin offering a subscription-based streaming Internet service by the end of this year. For a monthly fee, Redbox will soon offer on-demand movie access online in addition to continuing their kiosk services. Netflix, widely perceived as Redbox&#8217;s main competitor, currently draws in 20 million subscribers per year with its convenient online and mail delivery services. As media companies are often devising strategies to remain financially successful and keep up with their competitors, Redbox is hoping to expand its consumer base and cater to individuals who want an expedient service with the least amount of human communication possible.<span id="more-839"></span></p>
<p>With the recent successes of the Nook and the Kindle in the book industry, exhibitors in the motion picture/DVD industry have taken notice and are seeking a broader audience for their products. A relatively new company founded in 2003, Redbox currently does not have any registered customers in the way a company like Netflix does because of its lack of a subscription service. With the changes the company is making, however, Redbox will soon have customers who pay a monthly fee and are known to the company. As American consumers have become increasingly tech-savvy, the simple option of procuring a DVD from a kiosk may not suffice for either the company or the customers in the near future. <!--more--></p>
<p>As a trade-off for making its services more accessible to customers, it is likely that Redbox&#8217;s fees will increase for customers. This challenge represents a potential financial difficulty for the company. However, increasing surcharges at the expense of customer convenience is a common trend that can be found in an industry like the motion picture/DVD world. Redbox is gambling on the hope that customers will accept elevated costs for more convenience, especially as they are making the effort to compete with Netflix. By implementing changes that allow for online streaming and require customers to subscribe to its services, Redbox&#8217;s aim is no doubt to establish themselves as a dominant force in the industry.</p>
