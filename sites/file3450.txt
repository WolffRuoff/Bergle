					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Ok, I admit it, I laughed out loud when I first read your blog post a couple of weeks ago.  The title was what got me.....!  And who is the dude with the sign???  Anyway, great example here of the power of reviewers (again, facilitator power role) to either help or to hurt the box office revenue for a film.  Even with a small but dedicated audience, films like this are going to be kryptonite for studios because the motion picture industry does not have the kind of target marketing market model of, say, the magazine, or cable television industry.  In short, without a big box office draw, the success of projects like this will be quite limited.  Nice job with your really compelling and eclectic selection of articles during the second half of the semester, Group 3!&lt;/p&gt;
