<p>With the Mules trailing 5-0 six minutes into the second quarter and desperately needing a spark, Geyer provided it, racing 82 yards from the Muhlenberg 10 to the Susquehanna 8 to set up the game&#8217;s first touchdown two plays later. The Mules closed out the half on a 17-0 run and went on to win, 38-18.</p>
<p>Geyer set a school record in the game by averaging 35.0 yards on four punt returns, and he was named Centennial Conference special teams player of the week.</p>
<p>For a video of Geyer&#8217;s punt return, and other highlights of the football game from Service Electric TV2&#8217;s live broadcast, click here: <a href="http://youtu.be/YwIPRRnNKjo">http://youtu.be/YwIPRRnNKjo</a></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s another &#8220;MuhlBox exclusive&#8221; view of the punt return from TV2&#8217;s broadcast:</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/10/FBgeyerPOW.wmv">Cody Geyer punt return</a></p>
<p>The football win was one of several successful results for the Mules over the weekend. Field hockey, volleyball and men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s soccer all defeated Washington College and men&#8217;s cross country won a 42-team race, making for a near-perfect weekend, even if the weather was less than ideal for this time of year.</p>

			<p><em>There were many great performances in a strong week for Mule teams. Top honors go to &#8230;</em></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/10/josephsonhs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1950" alt="Joanne Josephson" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/10/josephsonhs.jpg" width="100" height="150" /></a>Female Athlete of the Week &#8211; Joanne Josephson, Volleyball</strong></p>
<p>Josephson made the most of her hits in a 3-0 week for the Mules, hitting .406 with only three errors in 32 attempts. In the two Centennial Conference matches against Bryn Mawr and Washington, she hit .524, recording six kills in only nine attempts in the former. Josephson also had 8 blocks and 4 service aces in the three matches.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/10/thomashs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1951" alt="Jeremey Thomas" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/10/thomashs.jpg" width="100" height="150" /></a>Male Athlete of the Week &#8211; Jeremey Thomas, Football</strong></p>
<p>Thomas filled up the stat sheet in the Mules&#8217; 38-18 home win against Susquehanna on Saturday. He had five tackles for loss among his seven stops for a Muhlenberg defensive unit that allowed only 144 yards, nine first downs and three points. One of his tackles for loss was a sack that forced a fumble on a third-down play, and he also intercepted a pass.</p>

<p><strong>Field Hockey vs. Washington College (Friday, 7:00)</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg&#8217;s Homecoming was two weeks ago, but this is the field hockey team&#8217;s homecoming. The Mules (3-6, 2-2) haven&#8217;t been at home in three weeks, playing five consecutive road games.</p>
<p>Their return to Scotty Wood Stadium is for a key game. Washington (3-5, 2-1) has been to the Centennial Conference playoffs each of the last three years. The Shorewomen have won the last three games against Muhlenberg to take a 12-9 series lead.</p>

<p><strong>Volleyball vs. Washington College (Saturday, 4:00); vs. Hood (Saturday, 4:00)</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/10/vb_dig4acure.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1943" alt="Dig for a Cure" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/10/vb_dig4acure.jpg" width="600" height="214" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/10/vb_dig4acure.jpg 600w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/10/vb_dig4acure-300x107.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/10/vb_dig4acure-500x178.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a>Muhlenberg will be hosting a tri-match while Digging for a Cure: All of the Centennial Conference volleyball teams are joining forces again this year to raise money for Tanner&#8217;s Touch, a non-profit organization that raises money for pediatric cancer research. Teams are collecting pledges for each dig recorded in a preselected match.</p>
<p>The Mules&#8217; designated match is against Washington, and it&#8217;s an important one between two teams looking to reach the upper echelon of the CC. The upstart Shorewomen (12-5, 2-1) have already swept two 2012 CC playoff teams (Gettysburg and Swarthmore). With a win, Muhlenberg (9-5, 3-1) will improve to 4-1 at the midpoint of the CC season for the first time since 2001.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg leads the all-time series against Washington, 18-2. Hood, the Mules&#8217; second opponent, brings a record of 4-10.</p>

<p><strong>Football vs. Susquehanna (Saturday, 1:00)</strong></p>
<p>Last year, Muhlenberg lost at Susquehanna, 17-0, for its first shutout loss in a Centennial Conference game since 1996. The Mules hope to avoid a repeat and head into the bye week on a winning note.</p>
<p>Even though the Crusaders are winless, they were leading in the fourth quarter of one of their losses and tied in another. They have already used three starting quarterbacks this season and rolled up 544 yards of total offense at Gettysburg last week.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg (2-2, 1-2), which has scored at least 58 points in each of its two home games, will try to take advantage of a Susquehanna defense that is allowing more than 480 yards per game. The Mules lead the all-time series, 11-10.</p>

<p><strong>Women&#8217;s Soccer vs. Washington College (Saturday, 1:00)</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg is playing at home for only the third time this season, and the first in two weeks. The Mules (4-5-1, 2-1) have never lost to the Shorewomen (3-4-2, 0-2), outscoring them by a 50-3 margin in 15 meetings.</p>
<p>Live stats: <a href="http://www.muhlenberg.edu/sports/wsoclive/xlive.htm">http://www.muhlenberg.edu/sports/wsoclive/xlive.htm</a></p>
<p><strong>Men&#8217;s Soccer vs. Washington College (Saturday, 4:00)</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a very balanced season in the Centennial Conference; only a third of the way through, no team has an unblemished record and every team has at least one point. Of the 15 league games to date, only one was decided by more than one goal.</p>
<p>So even though the Mules (5-5, 1-2), coming off back-to-back games against teams ranked in the top 20 in Division III, have a 23-1-2 series lead against Washington (5-4-1, 0-2-1), expect a close game. The Shorewomen lost only 1-0 to nationally ranked Franklin &amp; Marshall and tied regionally ranked McDaniel.</p>

<p><strong>Cross Country at Paul Short Run (Saturday)</strong></p>
<p>One of the largest cross country meets in the country, the 40th Paul Short Run will include more than 6,000 runners from over 450 teams in 14 races. It will be largest field the Mules have run in this year, and it will be on the same course as their other big meet, next month&#8217;s NCAA Mideast Regional.</p>
<p><strong>Men&#8217;s Tennis at Oneonta State (Saturday, 12:00); Men&#8217;s Golf at Mason-Dixon Classic (Saturday-Sunday)</strong></p>
<p>Men&#8217;s tennis wraps up its fall season with a trip to New York, while men&#8217;s golf heads south for a two-day tournament hosted by McDaniel.</p>

			<p><em><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/10/farmerhs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1936" alt="Nick Farmer" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/10/farmerhs.jpg" width="100" height="150" /></a>A good number of Muhlenberg men&#8217;s lacrosse players have studied abroad in recent years, but while most of them have gone to Maastricht in the Netherlands, junior Nick Farmer is spending the fall semester in St. Petersburg, Russia. He checked in to give a taste of his experience:</em></p>
<p>The farthest I’d been from home: the far-off land of Disney World. After a lackluster lunch, enduring my first piecemeal conversation/game of charades with a true Russian &#8220;security man&#8221; from Brooklyn, and chasing the sun nearly halfway around the world I finally felt the screech of the wheels on the tarmac of Pulkovo a decade later.</p>
<div id="attachment_1935" style="width: 250px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/10/farmer_winterpalace.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1935" class="size-full wp-image-1935" alt="Farmer in front of the former czarist Winter Palace (now part of the Hermitage Museum). " src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/10/farmer_winterpalace.jpg" width="240" height="501" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/10/farmer_winterpalace.jpg 240w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/10/farmer_winterpalace-143x300.jpg 143w" sizes="(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-1935" class="wp-caption-text">Farmer in front of the former czarist Winter Palace (now part of the Hermitage Museum).</p></div>
<p>As our tin can of a plane trudged to the gate, I sedately looked out the window only to see a white, wolf-like stray casually pacing down the runway. As if I needed assurance, between the dog and Cyrillic print on the Soviet-era hangars, I knew I had landed in St. Petersburg.</p>
<p>As soon as the first passenger stood up, everyone rushed out of their seats; the attendants didn’t even try to stop them (a type of behavior I have now grown accustomed to). The &#8220;security man&#8221; yanked me out of my seat and thickly gestured me to follow him. Half expecting to be mugged, abducted or worse, in a zombielike state I followed him to the passport line. Here we managed to cut half of the 300+ people patiently standing in line. Ten minutes later I watched him get his passport stamped only to disappear into the crowd of luggage haphazardly tossed around a large room, never to be seen again.</p>
<p>After spending two days in a hotel for &#8220;orientation,&#8221; I finally met my host mom, Nailya (which I couldn’t pronounce at all). Upon learning that I had only taken six hour-long courses of Russian over the summer, Nailya looked at me in a seemingly disheartened glare. The 15-minute wait for our late taxi was the most awkward experience of my life.</p>
<p>On the way up Московский проспeкт (Moskovsky Prospekt or Avenue) to my home for the next semester, Nailya pointed out a number of statues, administrative buildings, important streets and some of the various canals that are spread across the &#8220;Venice of the North.&#8221; Way too much information for me to take in, never mind try to understand across our mutual language barrier.</p>
<div id="attachment_1934" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/10/farmer_school.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1934" class="size-full wp-image-1934" alt="Farmer's school." src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/10/farmer_school.jpg" width="300" height="424" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/10/farmer_school.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/10/farmer_school-212x300.jpg 212w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-1934" class="wp-caption-text">Farmer&#8217;s school.</p></div>
<p>After nearly three weeks in St. Petersburg, I can walk down the street without smiling (* see note below), successfully figure out how to get home and even order a cup of coffee in the morning. Living in Russia, even in the most welcoming city in the country, is a daily challenge. If I hadn’t known that every day would be a linguistic mess, I would be having a miserable time. Instead, having locals laugh at me while attempting the most menial of tasks is entertaining and easily used as fuel to continue learning.</p>
<p>Exercising in public seems to be taboo, so I find myself running and working out in an overpriced gym on the bank of the Neva River, which runs through the center of town. Being away from Fall Ball at Muhlenberg, I’ve looked for a lacrosse club in the area to keep my game up. I managed to find one of only two clubs in the entire country and should be practicing with them this upcoming weekend. I can’t see practices going that long, it’s already starting to feel like winter here!</p>
<p><em>* We asked Nick to explain this &#8220;not smiling&#8221; business, and here is what he wrote back: &#8220;In Russia, there are a few different ways to tell a local from a foreigner (specifically an American) &#8211; 1. We speak English. 2. We travel in large groups and loudly speak English. 3. We show emotion in public. Number 3 has been the hardest for me because I sometimes smile at strangers when making eye contact with them on the street in America &#8230; or say please and thank you when ordering food etc.  &#8230; no one does that here hahaha.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>Global education is an important part of the Muhlenberg experience in a world that is becoming increasingly interdependent. Currently there are between 250 and 300 students studying abroad each year, and 52.4% of Muhlenberg graduates from the Class of 2013 studied abroad.<strong> </strong></em></p>

			<p>This week&#8217;s honoree as Play of the Week is Susan Galgano&#8217;s game-winning goal for the women&#8217;s soccer team at Dickinson on Saturday. The important Centennial Conference game was scoreless and appeared to be headed for overtime when Galgano took a back-pass from Nicole Karsch and fired a long shot that was perfectly placed, settling in under the crossbar and inside the post with just 15 seconds left.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, video of the dramatic goal is unavailable. So instead, here is video of a similar goal. On Tuesday at Scranton, fellow senior CJ Graetzer scored on a long shot to give the Mules an early 1-0 lead in a game they would lose in overtime.</p>
<p><a href=" http://youtu.be/3vxIg5MubQM" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1928" alt="video of goal at Scranton" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/10/scrantongoalvideo.jpg" width="500" height="279" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/10/scrantongoalvideo.jpg 500w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/10/scrantongoalvideo-300x167.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>Imagine that the field is grass, the markings on the other team&#8217;s uniforms are red instead of purple, the wall that says &#8220;The University of Scranton&#8221; is replaced by a chainlink fence, the game is played in daylight and the shooter is a few inches shorter and has shorter hair &#8211; and you basically have Galgano&#8217;s goal.</p>
<p>The goal was historic for reasons other than it being the first of Galgano&#8217;s career. It is believed to be latest go-ahead goal in program history (records are unavailable for 1991 to 1993, the first three years of women&#8217;s soccer at Muhlenberg).</p>
<p>To find the previous record-holder, you&#8217;d have to go back 12 years and all the way to Texas. In the second game of the 2001 season, Kim Klicka scored with 29 seconds left to give the Mules a 1-0 win at Schreiner and a split in their opening trip to the Lone Star State.</p>
<p>Including the last-minute scores by Galgano and Klicka, Muhlenberg has nine go-ahead goals in the last 10 minutes of regulation on record:</p>
<ul>
<li>89:45, Susan Galgano vs. Dickinson, 2013</li>
<li>89:31, Kim Klicka vs. Schreiner, 2001</li>
<li>89:00, Rebecca Armstrong vs. Centenary, 2003</li>
<li>88:20, Amy Phelps vs. Moravian, 1994</li>
<li>87:33, Nicolette Miller vs. Kean, 2008</li>
<li>83:24, Mallory DiMaio vs. Gwynedd-Mercy, 2006</li>
<li>83:21, Monica Jones vs. Haverford, 2000</li>
<li>81:00, Alyssa Meola vs. Dickinson, 2012</li>
<li>80:29, Mallory DiMaio vs.Moravian, 2006</li>
</ul>

			<p><em>Center backs take center stage this week following a pair of big soccer wins.</em></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/09/galganohs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1919" alt="Susan Galgano" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/09/galganohs.jpg" width="100" height="150" /></a>Female Athlete of the Week &#8211; Susan Galgano, Soccer</strong></p>
<p>Galgano waited until her 46th collegiate game to score her first goal, and nearly had to wait until at least her 47th. Galgano&#8217;s long kick found the back of the net with just 15 seconds left in regulation to give the Mules a 1-0 Centennial Conference road win against Dickinson. She was also part of the defensive effort that kept the Red Devils scoreless &#8211; Muhlenberg&#8217;s ninth shutout in its last 13 CC games.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/09/schauerhs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1918" alt="Jonathan Schauer" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/09/schauerhs.jpg" width="100" height="150" /></a>Male Athlete of the Week &#8211; Jonathan Schauer, Soccer</strong></p>
<p>Schauer led the Muhlenberg defense in a 1-0 defeat of nationally ranked Franklin &amp; Marshall. Playing with little margin for error against a Diplomat squad that had not given up a goal all season, the Mules allowed only three shots on goal, with Schauer winning many balls in the air and stopping several F&amp;M runs with tackles.</p>
<p>Schauer also was named defensive player of the week by the Centennial Conference.</p>

<p><strong>Men&#8217;s Soccer vs. Franklin &amp; Marshall (Saturday, 7:00)</strong></p>
<p>This is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> what the doctor ordered for the Mules (4-4, 0-1), who have lost three in a row and scored only one goal in their last 280 minutes. Franklin &amp; Marshall (7-0-1, 1-0) is ranked in the top 15 in both Division III polls and is one of only two teams in NCAA men&#8217;s soccer that is unscored upon this season. (The other is Division II Lander.)</p>
<p>The Diplomats lead the all-time series, 30-27-5, but the Mules have the upper hand since the start of Centennial Conference play, 13-7-2, including two postseason wins. F&amp;M&#8217;s last win in Allentown came in 2005.</p>

<p><strong>Field Hockey at Dickinson (Saturday, 11:00)</strong></p>
<p>The Mules (2-5, 1-1) are playing the fourth of five consecutive road games and will try to reverse the outcome of the first three, all of which they lost 2-1. Dickinson (5-2, 2-0) has already matched its Centennial Conference win total from a year ago, including a 1-0 defeat of 2012 CC finalist Haverford. Muhlenberg won last year&#8217;s game, 4-0, to extend its series lead to 18-12-1.</p>
<p><strong>Football at Johns Hopkins (Saturday, 2:00)</strong></p>
<p>These two teams have dominated the Centennial Conference since 2000, with Johns Hopkins going 70-24 (.745) and winning or sharing eight titles and Muhlenberg compiling a record of 66-28 (.702) with seven titles. No other CC team has a higher winning percentage than .553 during that span.</p>
<p>Hopkins (3-0, 2-0), ranked 13th by the AFCA and 16th by D3football.com, has won 23 of its last 24 CC games and is averaging 537.7 yards per game while allowing just 236.3. The only negative stat for the Blue Jays is their minus-4 turnover margin. The Mules are a CC-best plus-7.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg leads the all-time series, 23-21-1, but Johns Hopkins has won the last two meetings.</p>

<p><strong>Volleyball at Dickinson (Saturday, 2:00)</strong></p>
<p>The Mules (7-5, 1-1), coming off Wednesday&#8217;s sweep of Scranton, will try to avenge a disappointing five-set loss to the Red Devils last year. Muhlenberg leads the all-time series, 18-14, but has not won in Carlisle since 2001. Dickinson (5-8, 0-2) was swept by Haverford and Swarthmore in its first two Centennial Conference matches of the season.</p>
<p><strong>Women&#8217;s Soccer at Dickinson (Saturday, 2:00)</strong></p>
<p>One of Muhlenberg&#8217;s biggest victories last year en route to the playoffs was a 1-0 win in Carlisle. Dickinson had defeated the Mules five straight times, once in the 2009 CC semifinals. This year, Muhlenberg (3-4-1, 1-1) will try to snap a two-game losing skid against a Red Devil (4-3-2, 0-0-2) squad that has been shut out in its last three games.</p>
<p><strong>Men&#8217;s Tennis at ITA Southeast Regional (Saturday-Sunday)</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg travels to Mary Washington for a weekend tournament.</p>

			<div id="attachment_1902" style="width: 110px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/09/cellaryhs.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1902" class="size-full wp-image-1902" alt="Kevin Cellary" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/09/cellaryhs.jpg" width="100" height="150" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-1902" class="wp-caption-text">Kevin Cellary</p></div>
<p>The late author Michael Crichton was a master of suspenseful, thrilling novels. There wasn’t much suspense in the Muhlenberg football team’s 58-0 Homecoming win against McDaniel on Saturday, but senior co-captain Kory Crichton (no relation) was involved in a thrilling, one-of-a-kind play.</p>
<p>The combined 72-yard return by Crichton and Michael Long of Kevin Cellary’s blocked field goal was an easy choice for the Play of the Week.</p>
<p>And it was all planned. Sort of.</p>
<div id="attachment_1901" style="width: 110px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/09/crichtonhs.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1901" class="size-full wp-image-1901" alt="Kory Crichton" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/09/crichtonhs.jpg" width="100" height="150" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-1901" class="wp-caption-text">Kory Crichton</p></div>
<p>The Mules led, 14-0, late in the first quarter when the Green Terror lined up to attempt a 27-yard field goal. Crichton’s job on the field goal block unit was to wrap around the end to guard against a fake.</p>
<p>“I really wasn’t expecting it to be blocked,” said Crichton. “On the film you can see I looked back to see if the kick was good.”</p>
<p>But Cellary did block the kick, and when Crichton looked forward again he saw the ball bouncing in front of him. So did junior defensive end Greg DeLade, who had come around on the other side of the line.</p>
<div id="attachment_1899" style="width: 110px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/09/longhs.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1899" class="size-full wp-image-1899" alt="Michael Long" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/09/longhs.jpg" width="100" height="150" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-1899" class="wp-caption-text">Michael Long</p></div>
<p>“I looked at him, and he looked at me, and I was like, I’ll take it,” said Crichton. “I think he was acknowledging that I was faster than him.”</p>
<p>In high school, Crichton was an offensive lineman and did score a touchdown as the fullback in a goal-line situation, but he hadn’t played running back since his Pop Warner days. His only previous time carrying the ball as a Mule was out of the end zone on an interception return of a Hail Mary pass as time expired against McDaniel in 2011.</p>
<p>The 225-pound inside linebacker picked up the ball cleanly at the 28 with plenty of open field ahead of him and took off.</p>
<p>“Once I got to midfield, I knew some wide receiver was going to track me down,” he said. “So I started looking around.”</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/09/long_mcd.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1900" alt="Michael Long" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/09/long_mcd.jpg" width="275" height="561" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/09/long_mcd.jpg 275w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/09/long_mcd-147x300.jpg 147w" sizes="(max-width: 275px) 100vw, 275px" /></a>Every Friday in practice, Muhlenberg does a “witcha, witcha” drill, in which a defensive player runs the ball and players behind him say “witcha” – “I’m with you” – so the returner knows where to lateral the ball.</p>
<p>Long was with Crichton, behind him on the right, but that’s not who Crichton targeted. It was sophomore running back Kamal Kendrick, who was just off his left shoulder.</p>
<p>“I figured we practice it, so we might as well use it,” said Crichton. “As I was throwing the ball, [the McDaniel tackler] got my left arm.”</p>
<p>Instead of going to Kendrick, the ball bounced to the turf – right into the arms of Long, who ran it in the remaining 40 yards.</p>
<p>The play gave the Mules a 21-0 lead and was as deflating for McDaniel as it was uplifting for Muhlenberg.</p>
<p>“It would’ve been cool to score myself,” admitted Crichton. “I’m glad we scored because it was an unselfish play. I think that was kind of the dagger, and it gave our special teams some momentum that hopefully we can carry forward.</p>
<p>“It was a very awesome play.”</p>

			<p><em>The Muhlenberg cross country teams swept the team and individual titles at the Cedar Crest/Muhlenberg Invitational on Saturday, and now they sweep the weekly awards.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/croninhs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-207" alt="Nicki Cronin" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/croninhs.jpg" width="100" height="150" /></a><strong>Female Athlete of the Week &#8211; Nicki Cronin, Cross Country</strong></p>
<p>Cronin won Saturday&#8217;s race by more than 46 seconds, which is believed to be the greatest margin of victory for the seven Mule women who finished first in the 21-year history of the event. (The ohers &#8211; Samantha Mayden, 2012; Karen Mount, 2005; Katie Garrett, 2001; Laura Roth, 1998; Katie McGinn, 1995; and Amanda Wachter, 1993). It was Cronin&#8217;s second straight top-5 finish to begin the season and her first collegiate title. Her previous best was second place in the short race at the 2012 Dickinson Long/Short Invitational.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/09/munyanhs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1890" alt="Luke Munyan" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/09/munyanhs.jpg" width="100" height="150" /></a>Male Athlete of the Week &#8211; Luke Munyan, Cross Country</strong></p>
<p>Munyan also captured his first race since high school, defeating teammate Jaryd Flank by nine seconds. His time of 19:45.23 was 23 seconds faster than he ran on the same course last year, when he finished third. Munyan put himself in good company with his first-place finish: The only other Mules to win the race, Will Elson in 2000 and Rob Uniszkiewicz in 2003, were NCAA qualifiers in cross country.</p>
<p><em>Update: Cronin and Munyan also were named Centennial Conference runners of the week!</em></p>

			<p><em>Some tidbits from the football team&#8217;s 58-0 Homecoming win against McDaniel yesterday:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>The win was the Mules&#8217; second by more than 50 points this season &#8211; they knocked off The Apprentice School, 59-6, two weeks ago in their opener. The last time Muhlenberg won two games by 50+ points in a season was 2002, when it opened with a 54-3 victory against Kings Point and made its NCAA Tournament debut with a 56-6 defeat of Mass.-Dartmouth. The last time the Mules had three 50-point wins in a season? 1947.</li>

<li>Another reference to the 1947 team: The Mules have scored 138 points in their first three games &#8211; the most since that 1947 squad put up 158 points in its opening three games.</li>

<p>Freshman Nick Palladino quarterbacked Muhlenberg to the big win in his first career start, accounting for 334 yards of total offense on 264 passing and 70 rushing. Although he fell a little short of the school record for passing yards by a freshman in a game (290), he&#8217;ll get other chances this year. Something he won&#8217;t get another shot at: Palladino was the first Mule freshman to win his first start since Doug Donovan in 1990.</li>
<li>The defense kept McDaniel off the board for the second straight year and the third time in the last four years, marking the fifth straight season that the Mules have recorded at least one shutout. That&#8217;s the longest streak since Muhlenberg had at least one shutout for six straight years from 1999 to 2004. The Mules can match that next season, but to get to the school record they&#8217;ll have to keep going for a long, long, LONG time. Muhlenberg recorded a shutout every year from 1905 to 1943 in an era when (presumably) the offenses were less sophisticated.</li>
<li>Unquestionably, the play of the game was a 72-yard combined blocked field goal return for a touchdown in the first quarter. McDaniel was trying to cut its deficit to 11 points but instead found itself in a three-touchdown hole.</li>
</ul>

Crichton returned the ball (3) into McDaniel territory and, as he was being wrapped up, tossed it back to junior Michael Long (4), who ran it the final 40 yards for the first of his two touchdowns (5).</p>
<p>The touchdown was the Mules&#8217; 25th on special teams since 1999, and they have come in all different manners:</p>
<ul>
<li>kickoff return &#8211; 11</li>
<li>blocked punt recovery/return &#8211; 7</li>
<li>punt return &#8211; 2</li>
<li>fake punt &#8211; 2</li>
<li>fake field goal &#8211; 1</li>
<li>recovery of fumbled kickoff return &#8211; 1</li>
<li>blocked field goal return &#8211; 1</li>
