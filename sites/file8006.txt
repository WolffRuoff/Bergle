					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;This was very interesting Mel. I thought it was interesting because  I choose to talk about cyber bullying for my essay. I completely agree with you that cyber bullying now is definitely more prevalent than offline. With all the new social media sites there are now they are many different platforms for a bully to act which is completely unfair. Also you are 100% right when you said the screen gives people something to hide behind. Which is completely unfair and they should not be allowed to hide but they are.&lt;/p&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;This was a really interesting read, Melissa! I knew that cyber bullying was prevalent among I wonder why it is that cyber bullying is a lot more common among girls rather than boys. I also believe that a lot more of the cyber bullying going on now is a lot more online rather than offline because people feel a lot stronger behind a computer rather than in person. I think that is another issue in general, the fact that people feel a lot more comfortable with themselves on a computer than offline- interacting with people.&lt;/p&gt;
