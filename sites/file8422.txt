								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Internet has arguably become the most powerful thing known to mankind. It is one of the most popular and most widely used things by humans.  It has the ability to connect people worldwide literally making the world a smaller place. Online, you have the choice to be well known or anonymous, funny or serious, even evil or good hearted. The power of the Internet is unlimited and continues to grow every day. One of the scariest aspects of the Internet however is the fact that everybody has the ability to be anonymous. Anonymity is a very complicated thing, especially when it is applied on the Internet. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The video I watched was a TED Talk titled, </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Christopher &#8220;moot&#8221; Poole&#8221;: The case for anonymity online. Christopher Poole is famous for founding the anonymous imageboard website 4chan in which users can post anonymously on any topic they wish. It is famous for many memes including lolcats and rickroll. It is also notoriously known for many of the bad things the Internet has to offer. Interestingly enough, Poole did not really talk about the bad things that 4chan causes like the threats and the degradation of certain people. The closest thing he comes to talking about the bad side of 4chan are the rules, Poole says</span><span style="font-weight: 400">, “So does a site like this have rules? We do; they&#8217;re the codified rules that I&#8217;ve come up with, which are more-or-less ignored by the community.” This seems like an excuse that Poole is making. He is trying to explain that the fact that 4chan has a very negative connotation attached to it is not his fault. He even says, “The content is not dinner table conversation in the least.” This just shows how most of the content of 4chan is not of quality. I believe this is due to the fact that it is an anonymous site. I bet if 4chan required a username or picture that would eliminate the anonymity aspect of 4chan, the site would be very different from what it is like now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anonymity is also a very dangerous thing on the Internet because many people think that since they are anonymous they can do whatever they want. This is not the case, Poole says, </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And last, I&#8217;m going to show you the example, the story of Dusty the cat. Dusty is the name that we&#8217;ve given to this cat. This young man posted a video of him abusing his cat on YouTube. And, you know, this didn&#8217;t sit well with people, and so there was this outpouring of support for people to do something about this. So what they did is they &#8212; I mean, they put CSI to shame here &#8212; the Internet detectives came out.They matched, they found his MySpace. They took the YouTube video and they mashed everything in the video. Within 24 hours, they had his name, and within 48 hours, he was arrested.”</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This just shows how no matter what you do online and no matter how anonymous it is you might end up getting caught for something bad that you did. You always have to be aware of the consequences of every action, even online.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Overall, the Internet is anonymous whether we like it or not. I believe that you can have a great time on the Internet as long as you are safe. Since the Internet is anonymous you can have no idea who is who online therefore it is important to act just the way you would in real life. Sites like 4chan encourage bad behavior because of the anonymity aspect if it. One of the most important aspects of the internet that more people should follow is to be more aware of how they are behaving online.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Cyber Bullying and Facebook</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Social media has taken up a huge part of our daily lives. Without it we feel lost, unconnected with society, and left out. We have almost become completely dependent on it. I couldn&#8217;t imagine a day going without facebook, and many other people couldn&#8217;t either. We spend so much time online and meet so many new people through social networking it’s hard to tell who’s who online.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The article I read, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Cyberbullying on Facebook, How to Teach Teens About it?</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> Explains how the majority of our younger generation spends their time interacting online, especially on social media. The author explains the dangers of social media and the stigma associated with it. With all this time interacting online comes the danger of cyber bullying. People do not realize how prevalent and easy it is for someone to be bullied online. Bullies look to the internet and social media because it is easier to hurt someone online when there is an added anonymity factor. Bullies feel like it’s okay to bully other people online because they think it won’t hurt the other person. The author writes, “Cyber bullying takes behaviour born in the schoolyard and adds two elements: ubiquity and anonymity.” This is a very scary concept because what the author is saying is that a bully can be anywhere and anyone when you’re online. You never really know who is who online and you can never be sure that who you meet online is actually that person in real life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One main theme that comes up throughout the article is how people choose to behave online. The author writes, “Words that appeared frequently included “rude,” “mean,” “fake,” “crude,” “over-dramatic,” and “disrespectful.”’ I believe the sole reason that people are unkind online is anonymity. People feel as if there is a shield blocking them from the outside world. That is not true. Everything you say online stays there. Even when you think something is deleted, chances are it’s still there. Something you say online can hurt someone just as much if not more than if you said it to them in person. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A lot of people choose to act differently online because they feel like they can be someone else and change who they are. The author writes, “Often teens felt bolder, ruder, or more empowered </span><a href="http://nobullying.com/cyber-safety-facebook-and-real-life-the-struggle/"><span style="font-weight: 400">because they did not fear physical violence in the online space</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">.” The author also writes, “More often than not, teens believe that they find friends and romantic interests much easier to talk to and way more open in a Facebook chat conversation than in a playground or classroom context.” Both these quotes are related by anonymity. The fact that you can talk to someone (and possibly harm them as well) without being face to face with them. Some people may feel more comfortable talking online then in person.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Cyber bullying is connected with facebook in many ways, one of them being its popularity. So many people have access to facebook and it’s so easy to find people that it might be a cyber bully’s first place to look. The author says, “It can lead to the end of friendships, problems with parents, or wanting to avoid school. According to pewinternet.org, 88% of social media-using teens have seen someone be mean or cruel on Facebook.” 88% is a huge number of people who witness cyberbullying. Think of how large that number would be if private messaging didn’t exist and everything was public. That is just one of the reasons cyberbullying on Facebook is so prevalent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But cyber bullying isn&#8217;t just exclusive to facebook or any other type of social media. The author writes, “There has been considerable concern among parents, teachers, policy makers, and advocates about the nature and intensity of online social encounters among teens. The majority of teens have positive online experiences, but some are caught in an online feedback loop of meanness and negative experiences.” Cyber bullying can happen anywhere, to anyone, and at anytime. The dangers of social media will always be present as long as people continue to use it. Overall, I agree with everything the author says. Cyber bullying is a problem. I don’t think there is a way to stop it. I believe the only way to limit it, is to educate children about cyberbullying and the dangers of social media when used improperly.</span></p>
