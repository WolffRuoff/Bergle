					<description><![CDATA[I like the idea of the Ark Music Factory here, Group 1.  It definitely seems to be something of a challenge to the existing &quot;plantation style&quot; management that artists complain about with the traditional record labels.  The key aspect to me of this great example is the most major shift that makes something like Ark possible: &lt;b&gt;that the Internet acts as the distributor for the song.&lt;/b&gt; Without that critical piece, along with magnet sites like iTunes and YouTube, Rebecca Black&#039;s song could never have achieved the notoriety it has thus far.  This makes a great example for the paper!  Nice job here.]]></description>
