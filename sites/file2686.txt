								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Powers, Lindsay. (2011, February 17). Redbox taking on netflix with new digital streaming movie service. <em>The Hollywood Reporter</em>.   Retrieved from <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/redbox-taking-netflix-new-digital-100543" target="_blank">http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/redbox-taking-netflix-new-digital-100543</a>.<a href="http://mediaindustries11.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/02/gamefly-redbox.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-843" src="http://mediaindustries11.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/02/gamefly-redbox-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a></p>
<p>In an era when media industries must constantly adapt to developing technologies and consumer desires, DVD rental company Redbox will soon be making technology-based improvements in an effort to compete with its rival Netflix. Redbox, known for its compact, bright red kiosks stationed by grocery store and gas station exits, works by vending DVDs to customers at a rate of $1 per day via credit card. According to Redbox president Mitch Lowe, the company will begin offering a subscription-based streaming Internet service by the end of this year. For a monthly fee, Redbox will soon offer on-demand movie access online in addition to continuing their kiosk services. Netflix, widely perceived as Redbox&#8217;s main competitor, currently draws in 20 million subscribers per year with its convenient online and mail delivery services. As media companies are often devising strategies to remain financially successful and keep up with their competitors, Redbox is hoping to expand its consumer base and cater to individuals who want an expedient service with the least amount of human communication possible.<span id="more-839"></span></p>
<p>With the recent successes of the Nook and the Kindle in the book industry, exhibitors in the motion picture/DVD industry have taken notice and are seeking a broader audience for their products. A relatively new company founded in 2003, Redbox currently does not have any registered customers in the way a company like Netflix does because of its lack of a subscription service. With the changes the company is making, however, Redbox will soon have customers who pay a monthly fee and are known to the company. As American consumers have become increasingly tech-savvy, the simple option of procuring a DVD from a kiosk may not suffice for either the company or the customers in the near future. <!--more--></p>
<p>As a trade-off for making its services more accessible to customers, it is likely that Redbox&#8217;s fees will increase for customers. This challenge represents a potential financial difficulty for the company. However, increasing surcharges at the expense of customer convenience is a common trend that can be found in an industry like the motion picture/DVD world. Redbox is gambling on the hope that customers will accept elevated costs for more convenience, especially as they are making the effort to compete with Netflix. By implementing changes that allow for online streaming and require customers to subscribe to its services, Redbox&#8217;s aim is no doubt to establish themselves as a dominant force in the industry.</p>
