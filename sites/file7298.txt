								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nowadays children are spending far too much time and money on computer games. As a result, some people even suggest that video games should be done away with. They are nothing but a great waste of time, money and energy.However, in my humble opinion, it is meaningless to debate whether or not computer game is detrimental,since computer game itself is neither good nor bad; it is totally at our disposal.Being an indispensable side-product of IT industry, computer game has been burning its way into the fabric of social life. Obviously, the appliance of three dimensions and special sound effects has turned the plain gaming process into a visual and audio feast that we have never been to before. In addition, the brand new experience of playing another role in games is so vicarious and gratifying that when playing, people tend to immerse themselves thoroughly into the virtual world. It can definitely be a good entertainment and recreation, as long as it is taken in moderation. Computer-gaming binge is absolutely dangerous, but in that case, it is not the games to blame.<br />
Although many people doubt the advantages of computer games, if used wisely computer games can actually be used in educational purposes, for example typing games to allow students to learn typing English or Chinese. Also another advantage of computer game is that the games may be played together among friends or family members, which may improve the relationship between family members and allow parents to know more about their children on their hobbies and interests.<br />
However computer games if misused can also have very bad effects on human beings. Firstly spending long time in front of the computer screen will bring to various health problems, such as eye sore, back pain and headache. Also if people spend too much time on computer games rather than the work they should do, for example school work for students and projects and presentations for employees, it may have bad effects on their real life and social life status.<br />
It is true for everything that it is beneficial if used wisely, therefore although computer games are widely said to be bad for people, it can still be used as a good tool if used wisely.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, when you turn on the TV to watch the news, or search your smartphone or laptop for the latest news updates, what’s the headline?  Yes, that’s right, a headline instantly pops up notifying us who is ahead in the polls, Trump or Clinton? It is indeed a social media frenzy in an effort to get elected to the highest office in the land. An election, you say, that has been surrounded by nasty campaign ads, tweets, videos, emails, Facebook posts, sound snippets and a variety of other social media platforms that has essentially turned the election into a circus.</p>
<p>The hype surrounding this 2016 election is historic, in my mind. The presidential campaign has been a battle of social media events in an effort to reach millions of people, and no one has taken more advantage of it than the two running for The White House right now. While it is true that President Obama used social media to his advantage in the 2008 and 2012 elections, we must admit, that Trump and Clinton have taken this to a new level. “‘Visual Communication and the 2008 Election of Barack Obama,’ provided personal evidence of the dramatic shift toward social media as an essential strategy/tactic in public diplomacy efforts” (Payne 3). This relates to the election of 2016 as all of our attention has been shifted from what’s going on around us to the national social media where the strategy is to keep us influenced and informed. In the election of  2008 and 2012, they, too, had a similar occurrence where social media and campaign ads played a large role in the election, but certainly nothing like what is going on today.</p>
<p>The election seems to be all everyone talks about and, without a doubt, based more so on social media than anything else. This social media frenzy has stirred up the greatest president elect controversies of all time, so it seems!  So, stay tuned for all the latest in the social media buzz surrounding this historic election because you never know what might change your mind!</p>

				<description><![CDATA[Last Thursday Jim Groom discussed with us the subject of personal information on the web. Just like Google yourself, find your name, your school, or your original video, and this discussion also touches on our privacy concerns. This discussion was &#8230; <a href="http://fys142f16.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/2016/10/20/blog-post-5-jim-groom/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last Thursday Jim Groom discussed with us the subject of personal information on the web. Just like Google yourself, find your name, your school, or your original video, and this discussion also touches on our privacy concerns. This discussion was very detailed and really interesting, but it made me feel the danger. For example, Jim Groom showed us a video titled “Scary Pizza” which is a man who just ordered a pizza, but the delivery staff can find out a lot of his personal information, such as his address, payment methods, and recent shopping information, and that delivery person can record personal information while by phone. That could be a very threatening situation.</p>
<p>Jim Groom said at the time, everyone has a right to their own privacy. Normally, our personal domain can not be invaded, but the truth is that people&#8217;s personal information is taken by many companies during transactions. For instance, my mobile phone number has just been replaced with new one, but within a few days, someone called my phone and  asked me, &#8220;Are you XXX who living in the XXX&#8221; When I was wondering who this may be, the man began to sell insurance to me. In the same network, whenever you sign up an account, your information may be shown to others, the more info you give, the more personal information they receive. They may know you better than you do. That is not a good thing, you&#8217;re like a naked person staring at others, it makes one feel uncomfortable. Therefore, in order to protect personal privacy, do not to sign up some meaningless account or use illegal websites, which can make you become more and more vulnerable. Controlling one&#8217;s own personal information on sites is the first defense in protecting your privacy.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Is anything ever actually free? When I search the app store for the newest apps or any app at all, I seem to see the word FREE pretty often. So, that must mean the app is free right? Actually, no, not at all. Social media, in any form, is most definitely NOT free. According to the app store it may be free of cost, but according to the social media sites, they are getting a lot from the users in various hidden ways. Social media sites are not only getting publicity from the users, but also valuable and personal information from you as well in a roundabout way.  The information they collect is from all the “likes” they get and information that is taken in from people on these sites in relation to their social profile. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The information these sites request does not seem too serious of a thing to reveal, at the time, until you actually think about it and put it in perspective. What most people do not realize is that from just a single instagram post or pin from a user, a person can actually be found in their exact location. SO exact and precise that even the room, that person is in may be located. It is crazy but, it does not stop there! Sites like gmail or other email type sites seem to obtain ALL types of personal information from emails or searching the internet. Has anyone noticed that right after you buy something online, your email will have an ad that pops up for that particular brand or item you just bought or searched? Well, that happens because the email site reads bits and pieces of everyone&#8217;s email or internet searches! These sites pay particular attention to the likes and interests, you are searching and, in turn, offer other/additional items they think you might be interested in based on your history of shopping.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s amazing how this concept of “free” actually has a huge hidden cost and secret agenda to capture personal information. So again, is anything actually free? And do we actually own, privately, what we think we do with regards to our Social Media? The answer is simply NO. We do not even own our own pictures! Impossible, you may think, but a simple screenshot of a picture from an Instagram or any social site, can be taken and essentially can be owned by many. So, next time, before you post, search or blog, keep in mind who could be watching! </span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jim Groom is someone who is extremely educated on many things, and may or may not be one of the one people to help us answer this: Who controls your digital world?&#8221; According to Jim Groom, there isn&#8217;t really an answer to this question, that we know of. Specifically, Jim Groom talked about Domain Of Ones Own, or DOOM. This refers to your own personal Internet persona/who you are on the Internet, and how you use it. Everyone who has ever accessed the Internet has a domain of their own, and everyones domain is very different. When we start thinking about who owns our own domain, thats when it becomes complicated. Does the government own our domain? Do we own our own domain? Do companies like Google own our domain? Well, according to Jim Groom, they all do.</p>
<p>For example, in our class discussion, we watched the &#8220;Scary Pizza&#8221; video, making fun of what the world will turn into we keep giving the Internet our information. Watching this video, and seeing the woman on the phone interrogate the man who was ordering pizza was proof that companies are part of who owns our domain. Of course, we also have a say in who owns our own personal domain as we chose what we put out there, search, and like. This brought us into a discussion of who has all of our information. Does the government? Talking about books like 1984 and A Brave New World can give us insight to what the government may be capable of. This is a scary thought, and Jim made sure to remind us to always think about what we post, because in reality we don&#8217;t know who exactly receives this information and where it goes.</p>
<p>The idea of DOOM is definitely a scary thought, but listening to Jim Grooms discussions helped be get a better understanding of how to use the Internet safely.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After reading and analyzing &#8220;A Domain of One&#8217;s Own in a Post-Ownership Society&#8221; by Audrey Watters, it is still unclear as to exactly who owns our digital world.  However, it is now clear that it is not you.  You do not own your digital world.  Before taking this FYS class, I never thought about who owns my digital world.  Social media is a big part of my life and has impacted me tremendously.  I have spent a lot of time on multiple social media accounts ever since my parents bought me an IPhone in 8th grade.  I never once thought about who really owns these social media accounts because I always thought that I possessed them.  The account has my name and my information on my profile; so therefore, the account has to be mine, right?  Wrong.</p>
<p>In this article, Audrey Watters discusses how social media companies profit off of us (Watters 2016).  Although social media sites like Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, etc are free to buy, the companies make money off of us by owning our social media accounts.    They trick users in a way by thinking that just because there is no cost in purchasing social media accounts like Twitter and Facebook, it does not necessarily mean that there are not any costs in other ways.  Although you can make your social media account private from other users, it does not mean that you can make your social media private from the social media companies, because these companies own your account.  They can see tweets that you tweet, photos that you post, and the information that you post on your profile.  Although these accounts are free to purchase, you are exploiting who you are to someone or something that you do not know anything about, and thinking about it now, that can be costly.  Social media can cost you in other ways besides money.  Although social media is not dangerous, and although a random person from a social media company will most likely not hunt you down by seeing your personal profile, it is extremely important to watch what you put on social media, because you do not own your account.  Audrey Watters said, &#8220;When it comes to all our digital data, the answer to the question “what do you own” is probably “not much.” You do not own your Amazon Kindle books; you’ve purchased a license to access the content. Your heirs will not inherit your digital reading library. You do not own the music you stream; you’ve paid for a subscription. Your heirs will not inherit your digital music library&#8221; (Watters 2016).  This quote makes it clear that you do not own a lot in your digital world.  Most teenagers do not even own the IPhone they use to access these social media accounts that they also do not own.  After reading this article, and after spending almost 2 months in this FYS class, the question &#8220;Who owns your digital world&#8221; is a very prominent question, and although I do not know the exact answer to this question, I do know that it is not me.</p>
