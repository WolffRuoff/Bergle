					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;So proud of the tribute and sharing by student-athlete Austin Akner about all those represented here by Mr. Siller who offered their lives in every attempt to save others.

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I thought this young man wrote an extremely insightful, emotional, and &quot;honoring&quot; tribute to a very dedicated man---and to all those that risked and dedicated their lives to the saving of others.  I hope he and others can run again next year!  God Bless........&lt;/p&gt;
