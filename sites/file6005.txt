</em></p>
<p><strong>Volleyball at Washington College (Saturday, 12:30); vs. Lancaster Bible (Saturday, 2:30)<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Both teams came out of the gates in history-making fashion this year. Washington (14-5, 0-3) won nine of its first 10 matches for the first time in 36 years but has stumbled in Centennial Conference play, getting swept by Johns Hopkins, Gettysburg and Swarthmore in its first three league matches.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg, on the other hand, has remained hot and enters the tri-match having won 11 in a row to tie a school record. The Mules (18-2, 5-0) are off to their best CC start ever and are tied for first place with Swarthmore (which hosts McDaniel in a huge match on Saturday) and Haverford (idle Saturday).</p>
<p>A sweep of Washington and Lancaster Bible (13-8) would tie this year&#8217;s volleyball squad for the second-fastest to 20 wins in a season in Muhlenberg athletic history.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg has a 19-2 series lead against Washington, its lone losses coming in 1994 and 2010.</p>

<p><strong>Field Hockey at Washington College (Saturday, 1:00)<br />
</strong></p>
<p>The marquee matchup of the Mules&#8217; four on the shore is this game between two of the early leaders in the CC.</p>
<p>Washington (10-1, 3-1) has its best record after 11 games ever, losing only in double overtime to Johns Hopkins. Since then, the Shorewomen have won five in a row, outscoring their last three CC opponents by an 18-2 margin.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg (8-2, 4-1) comes in with a four-game winning streak that includes two victories against 2013 CC semifinalists Haverford and 20th-ranked Dickinson. The Mules are 8-2 after 10 games for the first time since 2003.</p>
<p>Both Muhlenberg and Washington have received votes in the Division III poll this season.</p>
<p>Washington leads the all-time series, 12-10, and had taken three meetings in a row before the Mules&#8217; 4-0 win last year. Muhlenberg has won three of the last four meetings in Chestertown.</p>

<p>Muhlenberg, ranked 20th by D3soccer.com, has experienced a little bit of everything in its four scheduled road games to date: a tie, a loss in double overtime, a game postponed due to weather and a game postponed due to field conditions. The Mules (7-1-2, 2-1-1) will look to add a win to that list.</p>
<p>Washington (4-6-1, 0-3-1) is winless in its last six games and has allowed a CC-high 19 goals this season. The Shoremen have long been a tough opponent no matter their record and this year is no exception; they lost by one goal to nationally ranked Salisbury and Dickinson.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg leads the all-time series, 24-1-2, with Washington&#8217;s lone win coming in Allentown in 2008. Of the 10 meetings in Chestertown since the start of CC play in 1993, six were decided by one goal and one ended in a tie.</p>

<p>Muhlenberg (6-3-2, 2-2) opened the season with a school-record seven-game unbeaten streak but is winless in its last four. A win would put the Mules in the thick of the playoff race and back on track heading into Tuesday&#8217;s home game against 2013 CC runner-up Haverford.</p>
<p>Washington (3-6-1, 0-3) is still looking for its first goal in CC play this year and has won only once in 16 CC games dating back to the 2012 season.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg has won all 16 all-time meetings with Washington by a combined score of 51-3. The Shorewomen&#8217;s last goal against the Mules came in 2003.</p>

Plus, a soccer showdown between ranked teams.<br />
</em></p>
<p><strong>Men&#8217;s Soccer at Franklin &amp; Marshall (Friday, 4:00)</strong></p>
<p>Two of the remaining 14 undefeated teams in Division III meet in a matchup that could shape the race for the top seed in the Centennial Conference playoffs. Franklin &amp; Marshall (9-0-1, 3-0), which reached the NCAA quarterfinals last year, is ranked third by D3soccer.com and eighth by the NSCAA. Muhlenberg (7-0-2, 2-0-1) is 21st in both polls.</p>
<p>In the CC standings, F&amp;M is tied with Dickinson for first place, with Muhlenberg two points back.</p>
<p>The two teams are tied for the fewest goals allowed in the CC. The Diplomats have outscored their opponents 23-5, the Mules 22-5.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg&#8217;s last game against a top-10 team was a 2-1 loss to No. 9 Swarthmore in the 2010 CC championship game. Its last win against a top-10 team was a 1-0 defeat of No. 10 Dickinson in 2009. The Mules haven&#8217;t played a team ranked in the top five since 2001 and haven&#8217;t beaten one since 1999 (3-2 vs. third-ranked Johns Hopkins).</p>
<p>Franklin &amp; Marshall leads the all-time series, 30-28-5, but the Mules lead in CC play, 12-7-2. Last year, Muhlenberg won 1-0 in a game the Diplomats came into ranked 14th in Division III, undefeated and unscored-upon.</p>

<p><strong>Field Hockey vs. Dickinson (Saturday, 11:30)</strong></p>
<p>So far, Muhlenberg (6-2, 2-1) has played three CC games this season, and the result of all three was the opposite of what it was last year. The Mules hope that trend continues against Dickinson, a team they lost to in 2013.</p>
<p>The Red Devils (9-1, 3-0) are ranked 20th in Division III and have won nine in a row since a season-opening loss to Juniata. They have allowed a CC-low seven goals in their 10 games.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg holds an 18-13-1 series lead and has won two of the last three meetings. The Mules have taken six of the last seven meetings in Allentown, including a 4-3 thriller in 2011.</p>

<p><strong>Volleyball vs. Dickinson (Saturday, 2:00)</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg (16-2, 3-0) will be playing for its 10th straight win, its first 4-0 CC start since 1993 (the first year of the league) &#8230; and a little bit more. This is the annual &#8220;Dig for a Cure&#8221; <a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/10/tannerstouch2013.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2431" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/10/tannerstouch2013-300x134.jpg" alt="Tanner's Touch" width="300" height="134" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/10/tannerstouch2013-300x134.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/10/tannerstouch2013-500x223.jpg 500w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/10/tannerstouch2013.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>match, and the Mules and Red Devils will be raising money for Tanner&#8217;s Touch, a foundation that raises money for pediatric cancer research at Johns Hopkins Hospital and also for families of children with cancer to offset the cost of medical treatment.</p>
<p>Both teams will collect donations and pledges from friends, families and team supporters for each dig they record in the match. To contribute, please contact Alexa Keckler at akeckler@muhlenberg.edu.</p>
<p>Dickinson comes in at 4-8 overall, 0-2 in the CC. Muhlenberg holds a 19-14 lead in a series in which five of the last 11 meetings, inlcuding the last two, have gone to five sets. Last year in Carlisle, the Mules pulled out a 15-12 win in the fifth set.</p>

<p><strong>Women&#8217;s Soccer vs. Dickinson (Saturday, 2:00)</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg (6-2-2, 2-1) will look to snap its three-game winless streak against a Dickinson squad that is ranked 22nd in Division III by D3soccer.com. The lone loss for the Red Devils (8-1, 2-0) came to top-ranked Messiah.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg holds a 15-7-2 lead in a series that has seen the last four games end with a score of 1-0. The Mules won the last two, both in Carlisle and both on late goals: Two years ago, the lone score came with nine minutes left, and last year with just 15 seconds remaining. The result proved to be the difference in Muhlenberg making the playoffs as the fifth seed and Dickinson staying home.</p>

<p><strong>Football at Susquehanna (Saturday, 1:00)</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg (3-1, 2-1) looks to bounce back from its first loss of the season against a Susquehanna (0-4, 0-3) squad hungry for its first win. The Crusaders&#8217; last three losses were by a total of 18 points.</p>
<p>The Mules will try to avoid a repeat of 2012, when they were shut out at Susquehanna a week after losing at home to Johns Hopkins. They will try to take advantage of a Crusader defense that is allowing 267.0 rushing yards per game &#8211; 233rd out of 242 Division III teams. Susquehanna does rank among the Division III leaders in fumbles recovered, however.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg leads the all-time series, 12-10. Last year, the Mules allowed 144 total yards and no offensive touchdowns in a 38-18 win.</p>

Plus, a big football game that could determine a trip to the NCAA playoffs.<br />
</em></p>
<p><strong>Field Hockey vs. Johns Hopkins (Friday, 7:00)</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg (4-2) was on a roll before dropping its Centennial Conference opener at McDaniel last Friday and has had a week to prepare for this game. Johns Hopkins (4-4) won its first CC game in double-overtime against Washington last Saturday.</p>
<p>Both teams have prepared for the season with strong schedules. The Mules&#8217; five non-CC opponents are a combined 21-13 (which includes an 0-6 by Drew) against other teams, and Muhlenberg is responsible for the only loss by ninth-ranked Montclair State. The Blue Jays&#8217; last two losses were to the teams ranked second (Salisbury) and third (TCNJ) in the most recent Division III poll.</p>
<p>Johns Hopkins has won the last four meetings to extend its series lead to 18-5. Last year, Muhlenberg could not hold an early 1-0 lead and lost, 2-1.</p>

<p><strong>Football vs. Johns Hopkins (Saturday, 2:00)</strong></p>
<p>The lone home event on Saturday is a powerhouse matchup of the two pre-eminent programs in the Centennial Conference this century.</p>
<p>Since the start of the 2000 season, Johns Hopkins is 81-24 (.771) in CC play and has won or shared nine championships. Muhlenberg is right behind at .714 and seven titles. No other team is close.</p>
<p>Johns Hopkins, the five-time defending champion, has won 32 of its last 33 CC games and is ranked 12th in the AFCA poll. Muhlenberg, which has finished second three straight years, is ranked 23rd. It is believed to be the first CC game ever between two top-25 teams.</p>
<p>And while it&#8217;s still early in the season, the winner of this game has gone on to represent the CC in the NCAA Tournament every year but one since 2002.</p>
<p>Both teams are 3-0, with only one close game (the Blue Jays&#8217; 27-20 win at Susquehanna). Muhlenberg, which has won nine straight regular-season home games since a 2012 loss to Johns Hopkins, has outscored its first three opponents by a combined 118 points.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg leads the all-time series, 23-22-1, but Johns Hopkins has won four of the last five meetings. The last three years, the Mules led 10-7 in the third quarter, trailed 13-7 at halftime and trailed 14-13 late in the second quarter but wound up losing all three games by double-digit margins.</p>

<p><strong>Volleyball at Johns Hopkins (Saturday, 1:00)</strong></p>
<p>A rematch of the 2013 Centennial Conference championship match pairs up the two hottest teams in the CC. Muhlenberg (14-2, 2-0) has won seven in a row, while Johns Hopkins (9-8, 1-0), which faced many nationally ranked opponents in the early part of its schedule, has captured its last six.</p>
<p>The CC has been characterized by tightly contested matches this season, with four of the seven matches &#8211; including both played the Mules &#8211; going a full five sets. Hopkins won its opening CC match in three sets against Washington.</p>
<p>The three-time defending CC champion Blue Jays lead the all-time series, 18-5, and have won the last five meetings, including a 3-0 sweep in the regular season and a 3-1 win in the CC final last year. Muhlenberg&#8217;s last series win came in Baltimore in 2009.</p>

<p><strong>Women&#8217;s Soccer at Johns Hopkins (Saturday, 1:00)</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg (6-1-1, 2-0) is looking to rebound from its first loss of the season, a last-minute heartbreaker against Scranton on Tuesday. A win would put the Mules at 3-0 in the Centennial Conference for the first time since 2001.</p>
<p>Johns Hopkins isn&#8217;t the ideal opponent for a team trying to return to the win column: The Blue Jays (7-2, 1-0) are ranked eighth by D3soccer.com and are 32-1-1 in their last 34 CC regular-season games.</p>
<p>Hopkins leads the all-time series, 16-9-1, and won both meetings last year, 5-0 in the regular season, when it was ranked No. 1 in the country, and 8-0 in the CC semifinals. Since 2009, the Mules have posted three upsets of Blue Jay teams ranked in the top 10, including a 2-0 win in 2012.</p>

<p><strong>Men&#8217;s Soccer at Gettysburg (Saturday, 4:00)</strong></p>
<p>Undefeated Muhlenberg (6-0-1, 1-0) hits the road for the first time this season for the first of three games in seven days against regionally ranked Centennial Conference opponents. The Mules are ranked third in the region themselves and appear in the top 25 in both Division III polls.</p>
<p>Gettysburg (7-1, 1-0), which has not made the CC playoffs since 2010, is off to a 7-1 start, its best in eight years. The Bullets are ranked seventh in the Mid-Atlantic Region, their lone loss coming to top-ranked Messiah.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg has allowed a CC-low three goals all season, while Gettysburg is coming off back-to-back four-goal games against Ursinus and Marymount.</p>
<p>The Mules lead the all-time series, 35-19-6, but had their eight-game series winning streak snapped with a 2-1 overtime loss last year.</p>

</em></p>
<p><strong>Field Hockey at McDaniel (Friday, 7:00)</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg (4-1) begins its quest for a second consecutive playoff berth with a trip to Maryland. The Mules come in with a four-game winning streak and have allowed only three goals &#8211; tied for the fewest in the CC &#8211; in five games.</p>
<p>McDaniel (4-2) brings a three-game winning streak into its CC opener. The Green Terror has not made the playoffs since 2006 and had a 3-7 CC record &#8211; its worst since 1999 &#8211; last year.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg leads the all-time series, 12-9, and has won the last two meetings. The last game played in Westminster was a wild back-and-forth affair in which the Mules came from behind twice before winning, 4-3 in overtime.</p>

<p><strong>Volleyball vs. McDaniel (Saturday, 12:00); vs. Cedar Crest (Saturday, 4:00)</strong></p>
<p>Fresh off its win against defending CC regular-season champion Franklin &amp; Marshall on Wednesday, Muhlenberg hops right back into the fire against a McDaniel team that it faced &#8211; and beat &#8211; in the CC semifinals last year.</p>
<p>The Mules (11-2) have won four in a row and lead the CC in kills per set (11.89), hitting percentage (.254), assists per set (11.09) and points per set (16.2). McDaniel (9-2), coming off a five-set loss to 13-1 Catholic, is the top blocking team in the CC, averaging 2.11 blocks per set.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg leads the all-time series, 15-8, and has won the last four meetings, including both last year.</p>
<p>The final match of the day pits Muhlenberg against 1-6 Cedar Crest. A win against McDaniel would put the Mules at 2-0 in the CC for the first time since 2002. A sweep would give them their best record (13-2) through 15 matches since 1993.</p>

<p><strong>Men&#8217;s Soccer vs. McDaniel (Saturday, 4:00)</strong></p>
<p>This is one of five games that open the 2014 CC men’s soccer season, and the early non-league results point to a highly competitive campaign ahead. CC teams have combined for an outstanding 42-12-4 (.759) record so far and occupy seven of the 10 spots in the NSCAA regional rankings released earlier this week.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg is looking to return to the playoffs after two years away, while McDaniel is seeking its first CC playoff berth since 2005.</p>
<p>The Mules (4-0-1) bring an unscored-upon streak of 428 minutes into the game; through Wednesday’s games, they were one of only nine teams in Division III to have played at least five games and allowed fewer than two goals. McDaniel (5-1) counters with the CC leader in goals and points.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg has won the last nine meetings to extend its series lead to 33-7-1, but seven of those nine games were decided by a single goal, including a 1-0 match last year in which the goal was not scored until the 72nd minute. The Green Terror’s last series win came in 2001 in the semifinals of the CC playoffs.</p>

<p><strong>Women&#8217;s Soccer vs. McDaniel (Saturday, 7:00)</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg and Bryn Mawr got the jump on the 2014 CC season last Thursday, but for the other nine teams in the league, Saturday is Opening Day. Of the five games scheduled, this is the only one featuring two teams that made the playoffs last year.</p>
<p>CC teams have done very well in non-league games, combining for a 38-19-4 (.656) record and placing five teams &#8211; including these two &#8211; in the regional top 10.</p>
<p>The first goal could win the game, as both of these teams have been very stingy. McDaniel has given up just one goal all season and Muhlenberg only two.</p>
<p>The Green Terror (5-0-1 and ranked ninth in the region) brings in a scoreless streak of 473 minutes. The Mules (5-0-1 and ranked 10th in the region) have set a school record for longest unbeaten streak to start a season and are coming off a very strong performance in a 1-1 tie against Lebanon Valley (ranked eighth in the region).</p>
<p>Muhlenberg holds a 14-6-2 series lead and has suffered only two losses to McDaniel since 1997. The teams met twice last year, with the Mules winning the regular-season meeting, 1-0. In the first round of the CC playoffs, the teams played to a scoreless draw, and Muhlenberg won the shootout to advance to the semifinals.</p>

<p><strong>Football at McDaniel (Saturday, 2:00)</strong></p>
<p>There was a time when the trip to Westminster was a dreaded one for the Mules: From 1990 to 2006, they lost nine straight games there. But the last three trips have been much more fruitful: three Muhlenberg wins by a combined score of 111-6.</p>
<p>The Mules (2-0) have won eight consecutive regular-season games and came within three minutes of opening a season with back-to-back shutouts for only the second time in 66 years last week.</p>
<p>McDaniel (1-1) is a building program that improved from 0-10 in 2012 to 2-8 last year. The Green Terror opened the 2014 season with a stirring comeback win at Catholic, scoring 20 points in the final 6:35 to pull out a 34-31 win. Last week, McDaniel dropped its CC opener to Moravian, 28-7.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg has displayed the ability to produce big plays both on the ground and through the air and will try to take advantage of a McDaniel defense that allowed an average of more than 450 yards in its first two games. The Mule defense will be tested by a Green Terror passing attack that has thrown the ball 90 times for 511 yards in the first two weeks.</p>
<p>McDaniel leads the all-time series, 22-19-3.</p>

<p><strong>Cross Country at Dickinson Long/Short Invitational</strong></p>
<p>Dickinson is hosting its annual two-for-one meet, which features a 4K race for both men and women in addition to the standard distances. The meet will give the Mule teams a chance to run on the course that will be used for the NCAA Mideast Regional come November.</p>
<p><strong>Women&#8217;s Tennis at ITA Southeast Regional (Mary Washington); Women&#8217;s Golf at McDaniel Fall Invitational (Saturday)</strong></p>
<p>Both teams are traveling south, tennis to compete in the regional championships and golf to open its season.</p>

Plus, volleyball competes in a tournament for the third straight weekend and men&#8217;s tennis opens its year with a home tournament.</em></p>
<p><strong>Field Hockey vs. Drew (Friday, 7:00)</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg (2-1) plays its fourth straight home game to start the season against a Drew team that was 16-4 last year but is winless in four games so far this fall.</p>
<p>Defense has been the key for both teams: The Mules have allowed only two goals, the only one in the last 204 minutes coming on a penalty stroke. The Rangers, on the other hand, have allowed 18 goals in four games, the most coming in a 7-1 loss to Montclair State, which was undoubtedly eager to take out its anger on someone after losing to Muhlenberg.</p>
<p>Drew holds a 15-13-1 series lead, including a 6-1 win last year, but the home team has won the last five meetings.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.muhlenberg.edu/sports/fhlive/xlive.htm">Live stats</a> | <a href="http://portal.stretchinternet.com/muhlenberg/">Live video</a></p>
<p><strong style="color: #373737;">Volleyball at Knights Invitational: vs. Eastern (Friday, 6:00); vs. Neumann (Friday, 8:00); vs. Moravian (Saturday, 1:00); vs. Widener (Saturday, 3:00)</strong></p>
<p>After going 7-1 at Gettysburg and in its own tournament the last two weekends, Muhlenberg travels to Neumann for another tournament. The Mules&#8217; first opponent, Eastern, reached the NCAA semifinals in 2011 and the quarterfinals last year and is currently ranked 12th in Division III.</p>
<p>Host Neumann is 4-0, Moravian is 5-5, and Widener is 1-6.</p>
<p><strong>Cross Country Co-Hosts Cedar Crest/Muhlenberg Invitational (Saturday, 10:00)</strong></p>
<p>The Mules, running a short distance from campus, will aim for a repeat of last year, when they swept both the team and individual titles. Senior Luke Munyan is the defending men&#8217;s champion.</p>
<p><strong>Football vs. Franklin &amp; Marshall (Saturday, 1:00)</strong></p>
<p>The Centennial Conference opener for both teams could turn out to be one of the key games of the year. Muhlenberg and F&amp;M, both of which opened the season with wins last week, have received ECAC bowl bids each of the last two years and have their sights set on unseating five-time defending champion Johns Hopkins.</p>
<p>In the CC preseason poll, Muhlenberg was picked second (with six first-place votes) and Franklin &amp; Marshall was tabbed fourth.</p>
<p>Franklin &amp; Marshall leads the all-time series, 53-43-1. Since 2005, the teams have traded two-game series winning streaks, with Muhlenberg winning in 2007-08 and 2011-12 and the Diplomats prevailing in 2005-06 and 2009-10. F&amp;M won last year, 28-21.</p>
<p>The Mules come into the game with an all-time record of 496-497-41. With a win, they will climb to .500 for the first time since 1931.</p>

<p>The live video will feature highlights from the Mules&#8217; win vs. Wilkes at halftime.</p>
<p><strong>Men&#8217;s Soccer vs. Stevens (Saturday, 7:00)</strong></p>
<p>The biggest win for the Muhlenberg men’s soccer team in recent years came at the expense of Stevens. In the second round of the 2010 NCAA Tournament, the Mules won 2-1 in double-overtime, handing the Ducks their first NCAA loss (other than by shootout) since 2005 and snapping their 34-game home unbeaten streak.</p>
<p>None of the players from that game and only one of the head coaches will take part in this year&#8217;s Homecoming rematch (only the second regular-season meeting between the two teams since 1973), but the memory will linger on in both programs for years to come.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg is 3-0 for the first time since 2011 and receiving votes in the national Division III poll. Stevens, which has won at least 15 games for the last 12 years, is off to an uncharacteristic 2-2 start after losing only one regular-season game all of last season.</p>

<p><strong>Field Hockey at Gettysburg (Friday, 3:30)</strong></p>
<p>The Mules have it all in front of them as they seek to earn a postseason berth. Muhlenberg (5-7, 4-3) and Gettysburg (8-4, 3-3) are tied in the loss column (along with 3-3 Haverford) for fourth place in the Centennial Conference, two games behind third-place Ursinus. The last three CC opponents for the Mules? Gettysburg, Haverford and Ursinus.</p>
<p>Gettysburg is second in the CC in scoring, averaging 3.8 goals per game, and has scored at least four in every game of its current five-game winning streak. Muhlenberg has allowed only 12 goals in its last 10 games, with three shutouts in the last four.</p>
<p>Gettysburg leads the all-time series, 17-6, and has won the last five meetings since Muhlenberg&#8217;s 2-1 overtime victory in the last game of the 2007 regular season. Three of those five games were decided by one goal.</p>

<p><strong>Volleyball vs. Gettysburg (Saturday, 12:00); vs. St. Lawrence (Saturday, 4:00)</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg (15-7, 5-1) and Gettysburg (12-10, 5-1) are tied for second place in the CC. If Johns Hopkins beats Haverford Friday night, that will become a three-way tie. The Mules have won nine of their last 11 matches, while the Bullets bring in a three-match winning streak.</p>
<p>Gettysburg holds a 26-2 series lead. The Mules’ lone wins came in their two playoff seasons. In 2001, they defeated the Bullets in the regular season but lost to them in the CC championship match, and in 2009, they pulled out a five-set win in the regular-season finale.</p>
<p>The second match has less riding on it but is interesting for the fact that Muhlenberg will take on St. Lawrence (located in Canton, N.Y., near the Candadian border) exactly one week after facing Millsaps (located in Jackson, Miss.). To drive from one school to the other would take about 22 hours.</p>

<p><strong>Women&#8217;s Soccer vs. Gettysburg (Saturday, 1:00)</strong></p>
<p>Even though the Mules (6-7-1, 4-3) lost to Swarthmore on Wednesday night, they should be in good position for a playoff berth if they can win two of their last three games. The first one won&#8217;t be easy: Gettysburg (10-1-3, 5-1-1) has outscored its opponents by a 31-5 margin this year and received two votes in this week&#8217;s D3soccer.com poll.</p>
<p>Gettysburg holds a 15-7-2 series lead and has won the last three meetings, all by shutout. Muhlenberg’s last series win was a 2-1 home victory in 2009.</p>

<p><strong>Men&#8217;s Soccer vs. Johns Hopkins (Saturday, 7:00)</strong></p>
<p>Far and away the top two programs in the 21-year history of the CC, Muhlenberg (7-5-1, 2-2-1) and Johns Hopkins (5-6-2, 2-2-1) are two of the five teams in a logjam in the middle of the CC standings. The Mules, playing their final home game of the season, are coming off a stretch in which they went 3-1-1 while playing four teams that were regionally ranked at the time of the game.</p>
<p>These two teams are no strangers to each other. The Blue Jays lead 15-10-4 in a series that includes eight postseason meetings. All but one of the Mules’ 10 wins have come in Allentown, including a 2-0 shutout last year.</p>

<p><strong></strong><strong>Football at Gettysburg (Saturday, 1:00)</strong></p>
<p>All 10 CC teams return to action after the league-wide bye, and Muhlenberg will try to repeat its second-half effort of last year, when it averaged 40.0 points a game in winning its last five regular-season contests.</p>
<p>On the surface, it looks like the Mules (3-2, 2-2) have a good chance to put up a lot of points against a Gettysburg (3-2, 2-2) defense that is allowing 35.0 points and 504.2 yards per game. But Muhlenberg, which is averaging 37.8 points per game, has had notorious trouble offensively at the Battlefield, scoring only 30 points in its last four visits.</p>
<p>Gettysburg leads the all-time series, 43-33-1, but Muhlenberg has won 10 of the last 13 meetings.</p>

<p><strong>Cross Country at Gettysburg Invitational (Saturday, 11:00)</strong></p>
<p>This will be the first race in two weeks for the men&#8217;s team and the first in nearly a month for the women. For both teams, it will be the final tuneup for the November 2 CC Championship meet.</p>

<p><strong>Field Hockey vs. Washington College (Friday, 7:00)</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg&#8217;s Homecoming was two weeks ago, but this is the field hockey team&#8217;s homecoming. The Mules (3-6, 2-2) haven&#8217;t been at home in three weeks, playing five consecutive road games.</p>
<p>Their return to Scotty Wood Stadium is for a key game. Washington (3-5, 2-1) has been to the Centennial Conference playoffs each of the last three years. The Shorewomen have won the last three games against Muhlenberg to take a 12-9 series lead.</p>

Teams are collecting pledges for each dig recorded in a preselected match.</p>
<p>The Mules&#8217; designated match is against Washington, and it&#8217;s an important one between two teams looking to reach the upper echelon of the CC. The upstart Shorewomen (12-5, 2-1) have already swept two 2012 CC playoff teams (Gettysburg and Swarthmore). With a win, Muhlenberg (9-5, 3-1) will improve to 4-1 at the midpoint of the CC season for the first time since 2001.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg leads the all-time series against Washington, 18-2. Hood, the Mules&#8217; second opponent, brings a record of 4-10.</p>

<p><strong>Football vs. Susquehanna (Saturday, 1:00)</strong></p>
<p>Last year, Muhlenberg lost at Susquehanna, 17-0, for its first shutout loss in a Centennial Conference game since 1996. The Mules hope to avoid a repeat and head into the bye week on a winning note.</p>
<p>Even though the Crusaders are winless, they were leading in the fourth quarter of one of their losses and tied in another. They have already used three starting quarterbacks this season and rolled up 544 yards of total offense at Gettysburg last week.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg (2-2, 1-2), which has scored at least 58 points in each of its two home games, will try to take advantage of a Susquehanna defense that is allowing more than 480 yards per game. The Mules lead the all-time series, 11-10.</p>

<p><strong>Women&#8217;s Soccer vs. Washington College (Saturday, 1:00)</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg is playing at home for only the third time this season, and the first in two weeks. The Mules (4-5-1, 2-1) have never lost to the Shorewomen (3-4-2, 0-2), outscoring them by a 50-3 margin in 15 meetings.</p>

<p><strong>Men&#8217;s Soccer vs. Washington College (Saturday, 4:00)</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a very balanced season in the Centennial Conference; only a third of the way through, no team has an unblemished record and every team has at least one point. Of the 15 league games to date, only one was decided by more than one goal.</p>
<p>So even though the Mules (5-5, 1-2), coming off back-to-back games against teams ranked in the top 20 in Division III, have a 23-1-2 series lead against Washington (5-4-1, 0-2-1), expect a close game. The Shorewomen lost only 1-0 to nationally ranked Franklin &amp; Marshall and tied regionally ranked McDaniel.</p>

<p><strong>Cross Country at Cedar Crest/Muhlenberg Invitational (Saturday, 10:00)<br />
</strong></p>
<p>The Mules compete in the closest thing they have to a home meet, crossing Ott Street to race for the first time in three weeks. Last year, the Muhlenberg teams swept this meet for the first time since 2008. Both Mule squads are ranked in the top 10 in the Mideast Region.</p>
<p><strong>Volleyball vs. Johns Hopkins (Saturday, 1:00)</strong></p>
<p>The two-time defending Centennial Conference champion Blue Jays kick off (or is it serve off?) the on-campus Homecoming activities. Hopkins comes in 5-4, with all of its losses coming to nationally ranked teams, while Muhlenberg is 6-4. Johns Hopkins holds a 16-5 series lead and has won 10 of the last 11 meetings.</p>
<p>Live stats: <a href="http://www.muhlenberg.edu/sports/vblive/topview.htm">http://www.muhlenberg.edu/sports/vblive/topview.htm</a></p>
<p><strong>Football vs. McDaniel (Saturday, 2:00)</strong></p>
<p>McDaniel nearly spoiled Homecoming two years ago, opening up a 26-7 lead before the Mules rallied with 27 fourth-quarter points. The Green Terror beat Moravian last weekend to snap a 13-game losing streak, while Muhlenberg is coming off a 28-21 loss at Franklin &amp; Marshall. McDaniel leads the all-time series, 22-18-3, but the Mules have won the last three meetings, rolling up a 413-168 margin in total yards in last year&#8217;s 33-0 shutout.</p>
<p>Green Terror senior running back Joe Rollins will be a player to watch, and one to tackle for the Muhlenberg defense. He rushed for 219 yards last week and is the ninth all-time leading rusher in Centennial Conference history.</p>

<p><strong>Women&#8217;s Soccer vs. Johns Hopkins (Saturday, 3:00)</strong></p>
<p>Johns Hopkins (8-0) soared to the top spot of the D3soccer.com Division III rankings after scoring road wins against then-No. 1 Messiah and then-No. 5 Carnegie Mellon. The Blue Jays are 37-4 in the Centennial Conference regular season over the last four-plus years, but three of those losses were to Muhlenberg, each time with Hopkins ranked in the top 10. The Mules (3-2-1) will look to make history repeat &#8211; again. They come in with a four-match unbeaten streak and an unscored-upon streak of 380 minutes.</p>

<p><strong>Men&#8217;s Soccer vs. Gettysburg (Saturday, 7:00)</strong></p>
<p>The last home event of Homecoming matches two teams that dominated the early days of the Centennial Conference, combining to win five of the first seven titles, but both failed to make the playoffs last year. Muhlenberg (4-2) is ranked eighth in the Mid-Atlantic Region, while Gettysburg (0-5) has lost eight straight dating back to last season. Included in the Bullets&#8217; setbacks is a 3-1 loss to Neumann, who the Mules beat. Muhlenberg holds a 35-18-6 series lead and is 8-0-1 against Gettysburg since the 2005 regular season.</p>

<p>The Mules (2-3) travel to Baltimore seeking to improve to 2-0 in the Centennial Conference for the first time in four years. Hopkins is 3-2 and opened CC play with a 4-2 win at Washington. The Blue Jays lead the series, 17-5, and have won the last three meetings.</p>

<p><strong>Field Hockey vs. McDaniel (Friday, 7:00)</strong></p>
<p>After winning their home opener in decisive fashion (5-1 vs. King&#8217;s) on Wednesday, the Mules stay at home to take on McDaniel in the first Centennial Conference game of the year. The Green Terror (2-2) won its first two games in overtime but has been shut out in its last two outings. Both teams finished 4-6 in the CC last year, and they played an appropriately evenly matched game, with Muhlenberg coming back twice to win 4-3 in overtime. The Mules lead, 11-9, in a series in which the road team has won the last four games.</p>

<p><strong>Football at Franklin &amp; Marshall (Saturday, 1:00)</strong></p>
<p>The defending Centennial Conference runner-up travels to Lancaster to face the team picked to finish second in the 2013 preseason poll. The teams&#8217; openers could not have been much different, with Muhlenberg rolling past The Apprentice School, 59-6, and the Diplomats losing to Washington and Lee, 14-13, on a failed two-point conversion in the final 30 seconds.</p>
<p>Franklin &amp; Marshall leads the all-time series, 52-43-1, but the Mules won the last two meetings by three touchdowns, including last season&#8217;s 21-0 shutout. Muhlenberg starting QB Joe Carlucci is the older brother of F&amp;M backup Anthony Carlucci, who played the second half of last year&#8217;s game.</p>

<p><strong>Volleyball at McDaniel (Saturday, 12:00); vs. Goucher (Saturday, 2:00)</strong></p>
<p>The Mules (4-4), who split on their first two weekends of play in 2013, will try to sweep this tri-match, just like they did last year, when they beat McDaniel in four sets and Goucher in three. The Green Terror (3-2), two years removed from a winless season, is improving but carries a 22-match CC losing streak into this contest. McDaniel leads the all-time series, 15-6, although Muhlenberg has won three of the last five. Goucher is 6-3.</p>

<p><strong>Women&#8217;s Soccer at McDaniel (Saturday, 4:00)</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg (2-2) takes its two-game winning streak into its CC opener against McDaniel, which outscored its first three opponents by a 16-0 margin before suffering a 4-2 loss to York on Wednesday. The Mules allowed only three goals in CC games last year, but one of them was to McDaniel in a 1-0 loss to open the league season. Muhlenberg went on to finish 6-3-1 and earn a playoff berth, while McDaniel ended at 2-7-1. The Mules lead the series, 13-6-1, and had not lost to the Green Terror since 2003 before last year.</p>

			<p><em>Football is off this weekend, and so is cross country, but all the rest of the fall teams are home for a big weekend of Centennial Conference competition.</em></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-104" title="Mule Marquee Matchup" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1-300x203.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="203" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1-300x203.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Field Hockey vs. Washington College (Saturday, 1:00)</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg (7-3, 3-2), which has matched its combined win total from the last two years, has five CC games remaining &#8211; all but one against teams that qualified for the CC playoffs in 2010 and/or 2011. Washington (5-5, 2-2), the first of those opponents, made the playoffs both years.</p>
<p>Last year, the Shorewomen handed the Mules one of their worst losses, scoring four first-half goals en route to a 5-1 win. Washington leads the all-time series, 11-9.</p>

<p><strong>Volleyball vs. Washington College (Saturday, 12:00); vs. Cedar Crest (Saturday, 4:00)</strong></p>
<p>After falling to 1-3 in the CC with a loss at Dickinson last weekend, Muhlenberg (10-6) rebounded to sweep Bryn Mawr on Wednesday. This is a critical match for the Mules if they are to make a run at the CC playoffs, as their next three league matches are against 2011 playoff qualifiers. Washington (7-10, 2-2) owns a win against one of them, Gettysburg.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg has won 17 of 19 all-time meetings with the Shorewomen, losing only in 1994 and 2010. The Mules are 20-4 all-time against Cedar Crest (8-9), although the two Allentown schools haven&#8217;t faced each other since 2001.</p>

<p><strong>Women&#8217;s Soccer vs. Washington College (Saturday, 4:00)</strong></p>
<p>Just two weeks ago, Muhlenberg was on the verge of being virtually out of the playoff picture, with an 0-2 CC record and games against nationally ranked Johns Hopkins and regionally ranked Dickinson looimng. But the Mules (5-6-1, 3-2) won both of those games and are right in the thick of things &#8211; and their next two games are against teams below them in the standings, including Washington (4-5, 1-3).</p>
<p>Muhlenberg is a perfect 14-0 against the Shorewomen and has outscored them 46-3. Washington&#8217;s last goal against the Mules came in 2003.</p>

<p>In a span of 44 hours last week, Muhlenberg went from sole possession of first place in the CC to the middle of the pack. Coming off Wednesday&#8217;s non-conference win at TCNJ, the Mules (6-3, 2-2) will try to re-establish themselves as one of the teams to beat in the CC. Washington is 3-5 overall, 2-2 in the CC.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg holds a commanding 22-1-2 series lead, with Washington&#8217;s lone win coming in 2008. Since then, the Mules have posted three straight shutout wins against the Shoremen.</p>
