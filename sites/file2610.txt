					<description><![CDATA[Once again, Group 4, I think you could have done a bit better with the article selection - There&#039;s not much here to work with in terms of length and substance in the article you selected, so I imagine it was a bit more difficult to write this particular blog post.  Clearly, media companies are interested in hiring talent and executives with a track record in the industry - this is part of the strategy for limiting risk for future decisions.  That said, I found myself more interested in some of shows you mentioned and how they might have compared to MTV&#039;s &lt;i&gt;Skins&lt;/i&gt; in terms of market success, style, etc, than I was with the hiring of specific individuals to work for MTV.  So, I think you are definitely on the right path as far as analysis is concerned, but I urge you to look at some of the databases that Jen Jarson showed us in class as a tool to help you find more relevant and substantive articles for the blog.  Just let me know if you need any help with this.]]></description>
