<p>Muhlenberg (8-2) hosts the ECAC South Atlantic Bowl for the second straight year, welcoming a Salisbury (6-4) squad that was nationally ranked for most of the season.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.muhlenberg.edu/main/athletics/fall13/1122.html">preview</a> | <a href="http://www.muhlenberg.edu/sports/livestats/xlive.htm">live stats</a> | <a href="http://www.livestream.com/muhlenberg">live video</a></p>
<p><strong>Basketball at Washington College (Saturday, women at 2:00; men at 4:00)</strong></p>
<p>Both Muhlenberg teams are off to a hot start, with three wins and a Scotty Wood Tournament title under their belts. Although this is the third time in the last four years that both Mule squads started 3-0, it&#8217;s never happened that both started 4-0.</p>
<p>It also had never happened that both teams won a one-point game this early in the season, but the men edged Gwynedd Mercy, 81-80, in the Scotty Wood final, and the women outlasted Swarthmore, 75-74, in their overtime Centennial Conference opener.</p>
<p>This is the 21st time in the last 21 years that the Muhlenberg teams aren&#8217;t quite sure what to expect from their trip to Chestertown. Traditionally one of the hardest places in the CC for the Mules to play, the men won there last year but are only 5-16 at Washington since the start of CC play. The women have fared better, going 16-4, but it hasn&#8217;t been easy; two years ago, they <a href="http://www.muhlenberg.edu/main/athletics/winter12/0121.html">overcame a 17-point deficit</a> to win by three.</p>
<p>Both Washington teams are 0-2.</p>

			<p><em>Basketball shots &#8211; five from long range and one from very close range &#8211; from the Scotty Wood Tournament take this week&#8217;s honors.</em></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/stenger_three.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2110" alt="Abby Stenger" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/stenger_three.jpg" width="230" height="519" /></a>Female Play of the Week &#8211; Abby Stenger&#8217;s run of threes</strong></p>
<p>The Mule women&#8217;s basketball team had a 12-point lead cut to three earlier in the half, so when it went up 51-41 with 11 minutes left in the Scotty Wood championship game, there was still a chance that Misericordia would come back again. Stenger made sure that didn&#8217;t happen, drilling five straight three-pointers in a five-minute span. By the time her run was done, the Mules led by 23 (70-47) and were well on their way to the championship.</p>
<p>To say that the spurt came out of nowhere would be an understatement: Stenger missed her first seven shots from three-point range in the tournament, and the Mules and Cougars were a combined 0-for-9 from behind the arc before Stenger went off.</p>

<p><strong>Male Play of the Week &#8211; Malique Killing pass for Kevin Hargrove dunk</strong></p>
<p>Killing distinguished himself with his scoring during the Scotty Wood Tournament, netting 28 points &#8211; including the 1,000th of his career &#8211; in the championship game to earn MVP honors. But in the first-round game against Bryn Athyn, it was a pass he made that brought the loudest cheers.</p>
<p>With the Mules already leading 69-44, Killing rebounded a missed Lion three-pointer, dribbled the length of the court, spun in the lane and fed an open Hargrove for a dunk.</p>

			<p><em>Not much going on in Muhlenberg athletics this weekend &#8211; except for an eight-team basketball tournament, a rivalry football game, an NCAA cross country meet, a postseason soccer tournament and four wrestling matches. It&#8217;s one of the biggest weekends of the year!</em></p>
<p><strong>Basketball hosts Scotty Wood Tournament (Friday and Saturday, 1, 3, 6, and 8)</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/swtlogo_new.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2090" alt="Scotty Wood Tournament" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/swtlogo_new-300x230.jpg" width="300" height="230" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/swtlogo_new-300x230.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/swtlogo_new-390x300.jpg 390w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/swtlogo_new.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>The Scotty Wood Tournament tips off the Muhlenberg basketball season for the 32nd year. The Mule women open up against Rowan on Friday at 6:00, followed by the men against Bryn Athyn. Both Muhlenberg teams are trying to recapture the titles they won in 2011 after falling in the championship games last year.</p>

<p><strong>Cross Country hosts NCAA Mideast Regional (Saturday, women at 11:00, men at 12:30)</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/ncaaxcsquare.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2092" alt="NCAA cross country" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/ncaaxcsquare.jpg" width="203" height="211" /></a>Nearly 1,000 runners from 60 schools are scheduled to line up on Lehigh&#8217;s Goodman Campus in one of eight qualifier meets for the NCAA Championships (slated for next Saturday at Hanover, Ind.). Haverford has won the men&#8217;s meet the last three years, while Johns Hopkins brings in a streak of five straight regional championships.</p>
<p>The top two teams in each race automatically qualify for the NCAA Championships, and there are also 16 at-large berths available to fill out the 32-team national field. After the team bids have been determined, the top seven individuals in each region not on a qualifying team are selected to run in the national meet.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg, which is hosting the regional meet for the fourth time since 2001, has sent at least one runner to the NCAA Championships for the last eight seasons. Senior Nicki Cronin, who earned all-region honors by placing in the top 35 in both 2011 and 2012 and narrowly missed an NCAA berth last year, is the top candidate to continue that streak.</p>

<p><strong>Football vs. Moravian (Saturday, 1:00)</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/moraviantrophy.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2089" alt="football trophy" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/moraviantrophy.jpg" width="250" height="539" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/moraviantrophy.jpg 250w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/moraviantrophy-139x300.jpg 139w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px" /></a>In addition to all the reasons Moravian and Muhlenberg football players have anticipated this rivalry game for more than 50 years &#8211; local bragging rights, one last win for the seniors, etc. &#8211; there is now something else: A gleaming new trophy, donated by Sodexo, will go to the winner.</p>
<p>The Mules (7-2, 6-2) come in on a historic roll, having beaten five straight opponents by at least 20 points for the first time in program history. The Greyhounds (2-7, 2-6) are on a surge of their own, with two wins in their last three games following on 0-6 start.</p>
<p>Moravian has topped the 40-point mark three times in its last five games and boasts the top freshman runner and top rushing quarterback in the Centennial Conference. Muhlenberg has allowed only one offensive touchdown at home this season and ranks in the top 30 in Division III in scoring defense (20th), pass efficiency defense (24th), total defense (26th) and rushing defense (28th). The Mules have given up only three offensive touchdowns in their five-game winning streak.</p>
<p>Two Mule milestones are possible: Nick Palladino needs 141 yards to break the CC mark for passing yards by a freshman, and Cody Geyer needs 88 receiving yards to record the fourth 1,000-yard season in program history.</p>
<p>Moravian leads the all-time series, 33-26-2, but Muhlenberg has won eight of the last 11 meetings. The Mules have not allowed an offensive touchdown in taking the last two meetings.</p>

<p><strong>Men&#8217;s Soccer at Swarthmore (Saturday, 7:00)</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/ecacclr.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2091" alt="ECAC logo" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/ecacclr-300x93.jpg" width="300" height="93" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/ecacclr-300x93.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/ecacclr.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>The Mules (10-7-1) look to extend their season with an ECAC South semifinal game against CC rival Swarthmore (10-5-4). The winner faces the winners of the other semi between Frostburg State and Lebanon Valley in Sunday&#8217;s championship match.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg hasn&#8217;t beaten Swarthmore since 2007, but all the meetings since have been close: a scoreless tie, two 1-0 games and four 2-1 games. The last time the teams faced each other in the postseason was the 2010 CC championship game, a thriller that the Garnet won in double overtime.</p>
<p>The Mules went on to advance to the NCAA &#8220;Sweet 16&#8221; that year, which was the last time they won two postseason games in a season. Muhlenberg reached the ECAC championship game in both 1999 and 2000; its last ECAC title came in 1988.</p>

<p><strong>Wrestling at Penn Tech with Lafayette (Saturday, 12:00); at Scranton with Yeshiva (Sunday, 11:00)</strong></p>
<p>After winning a dual meet at Mount St. Vincent last weekend, the Mules will try to pick up some more wins. Muhlenberg outscored Scranton in contested bouts, 25-3, the last two years, but lost the matches due to forfeits. The Mules defeated Yeshiva, 24-15, when the teams last met in 2011.</p>

			<p><em>It&#8217;s Wong and Long for our plays of the week.</em></p>
<p><strong>Female Play of the Week &#8211; Amanda Wong, Soccer</strong></p>
<p>This was an easy pick &#8211; Muhlenberg led McDaniel, 4-3, in a shootout in the first round of the Centennial Conference playoffs when Wong lined up to face a penalty kick from Kristin Hart. Wong dove to her right as the ball was struck and saved the shot, giving the Mules the win and sending them to the CC semifinals.</p>
<p>It was the first time in Muhlenberg soccer history that a postseason shootout ended with a Mule goalie saving a PK. Wong was phenomenal throughout the game, tying a career high with 12 saves in the scoreless tie.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Male Play of the Week &#8211; Michael Long, Football</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg has been at its exciting and explosive best during its current five-game winning streak with long passes to receivers (well, one receiver in particular) streaking down the field.</p>
<p>Its longest play came on a pass that traveled about 4 yards beyond the line of scrimmage.</p>
<p>The Mules led Ursinus, 20-3, at the start of the fourth quarter, but after a sluggish third quarter in which they&#8217;d gained a grand total of 3 yards on their last 10 plays, they needed a big play to shake things up and turn the field around.</p>
<p>Facing 2nd and 11 from its own 17 on the first play of the final period, Muhlenberg got the big play from Long. It didn&#8217;t look like much when Nick Palladino threw a quick pass to Long at the 21, but the big tight end broke a tackle, got some good downfield blocking from Chris Litzenberger and knocked down two would-be tacklers with stiff arms before finally getting dragged down at the Ursinus 17.</p>
<p>The 66-yard play was the Mules&#8217; longest from scrimmage this season.</p>
<p>Video: <a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/Long-66yd-pass.wmv">Michael Long 66yd pass</a></p>
<p>Three plays later, Muhlenberg was in the end zone to make it 27-3, and less than three minutes, an interception and a long touchdown pass after that, it was 34-3.</p>
<p>Although Long gets the top honor for the second time this season, it really wouldn&#8217;t be the play of the week without some Cody Geyer footage. Below is video of his three touchdown receptions in the 41-10 win.</p>

<p><strong>Women&#8217;s Soccer at Johns Hopkins (Friday, 5:00)</strong></p>
<p>Coming off their thrilling shootout win against McDaniel in the first round of the Centennial Conference playoffs, the Mules (7-10-2) will need another tremendous team effort against Johns Hopkins in the semifinals. The Blue Jays (16-1-1) are ranked fifth in Division III, have won seven of the last eight CC championships and are 8-0 at home this season. They won the regular-season meeting against Muhlenberg, 5-0.</p>
<p>This will be the fifth postseason meeting between the two teams, with Johns Hopkins holding a 2-1-1 advantage. The Mules beat Blue Jay teams ranked in the top 10 in three of the last five years.</p>

<p><strong>Volleyball vs. McDaniel at Franklin &amp; Marshall (Saturday, 3:30)</strong></p>
<p>Two teams that tied for last place in the CC three years ago meet in a semifinal match, with the winner headed to Sunday&#8217;s championship match. It&#8217;s the second postseason meeting between the two schools; the first came in the 1992 MAC playoffs.</p>

<p><strong>Football at Ursinus (Saturday, 1:00)</strong></p>
<p>These two teams are tied for second place in the Centennial Conference and have identical records of 6-2 overall and 5-2 in the league. Muhlenberg comes in on a roll, having won its last four games, all by at least 20 points. Ursinus was 5-0 before the bye week and has been hard to figure out since returning: The Bears lost 28-7 at home to Juniata and nearly won at Johns Hopkins.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg has won 12 of the last 13 meetings to extend its series lead to 45-24-7. The last two meetings came down to the last play, with the Mules blocking a field goal at the final horn for a 24-21 win two years ago and batting away a pass in overtime last season to preserve a 24-17 victory.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Wow, did that really happen?&#8221; quipped senior CJ Graetzer as the elated Muhlenberg women&#8217;s soccer team filed onto the bus following its shootout win against McDaniel in the first round of the Centennial Conference playoffs on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Yes, it did happen. And it, or something like it, has happened before &#8211; about 17 times in the last 27 years.</p>
<p>Following is a list of Muhlenberg &#8220;Playoff Walkoffs&#8221; &#8211; postseason contests that were decided on the last play and enabled a Mule team to advance or win a championship. (We stretched the definition of &#8220;last play&#8221; slightly for the two basketball games.)</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/wsocbig_110513.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2065" alt="women's soccer 2013" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/wsocbig_110513.jpg" width="400" height="228" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/wsocbig_110513.jpg 400w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/wsocbig_110513-300x171.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></a>Women&#8217;s Soccer vs. McDaniel, 2013</strong></p>
<p>After a scoreless tie, the Mules won the penalty kick shootout, 4-3, to advance to the Centennial Conference semifinals. Amanda Wong stopped a Green Terror PK on the final play of the game.</p>

<p><strong>Men&#8217;s Basketball vs. Gettysburg, 2013</strong></p>
<p>Malique Killing hit a jumper from the top of the key with seven-tenths of a second remaining for a 45-43 win in a CC first-round game.</p>

<p>Alexandra Chili&#8217;s step-back three from the corner with one second left lifted the Mules to a 64-63 win in the first round of the NCAA Tournament. Muhlenberg went on to defeat Rochester the next day to advance to the &#8220;Sweet 16.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Men&#8217;s Soccer vs. Stevens, 2010</strong></p>
<p>Stevens was ranked 13th in Division III, owned a 34-match home unbeaten streak and had not lost in the NCAA Tournament (except on penalty kicks) since 2005 &#8211; until Josh Luginbuhl scored a &#8220;Golden Goal&#8221; with 3:21 left in double overtime to send Muhlenberg to the &#8220;Sweet 16&#8221; with a 2-1 win.</p>

<p><strong>Softball vs. Gettysburg, 2009</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg trailed 5-3 heading into the bottom of the seventh of this CC first-round playoff game. Four singles cut the deficit to one run, and then Samantha Crist hit a walkoff grand slam for an 8-5 win. It wound up winning the championship for the Mules, who were awarded the title as the highest remaining seed when the tournament was rained out the next day.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/kliewer.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2068" alt="Jonathan Kliewer" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/kliewer.jpg" width="216" height="238" /></a>Men&#8217;s Soccer vs. Franklin &amp; Marshall, 2004</strong></p>
<p>The Mules were 0-3 in overtime games for the season before Jonathan Kliewer, playing near his hometown of Ephrata, Pa., scored a &#8220;Golden Goal&#8221; 1:21 into extra time for a 1-0 win in the first round of the CC playoffs.</p>
<p><strong>Men&#8217;s Soccer vs. Gordon, 2003</strong></p>
<p>In the first round of the NCAA Tournament, Evan Smallwood converted a PK with five minutes left in regulation to tie the game at 2-2. After two scoreless overtime periods, Smallwood ended the shootout with another successful penalty.</p>
<p><strong>Softball vs. Merchant Marine, 2003</strong></p>
<p>Tied 5-5 after four innings, the Mules and Mariners battled through seven scoreless innings in this NCAA Tournament elimination game. Kristen Best finally ended the marathon game with a walkoff single in the bottom of the 12th.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/wsocecac1999.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2069" alt="women's soccer 1999" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/wsocecac1999.jpg" width="400" height="242" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/wsocecac1999.jpg 400w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/wsocecac1999-300x181.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></a>Women&#8217;s Soccer vs. Johns Hopkins, 1999</strong></p>
<p>Maybe the best career postseason walkoff in Muhlenberg history: Hilary Moses (No. 4 in the picture), a senior whose playing time had been limited by injuries, made the winning penalty kick in the ECAC championship game on the final play of her Mule career.</p>
<p><strong>Men&#8217;s Soccer vs. Messiah, 1995</strong></p>
<p>The latest into the postseason for a Muhlenberg walkoff; Todd Ervin&#8217;s &#8220;Golden Goal&#8221; in the 126th minute (overtimes were 15 minutes then, and teams played as many as four before going into PKs) on a frigid night gave the 10th-ranked Mules a 1-0 win against the third-ranked Falcons in an NCAA regional final. Muhlenberg defeated Ithaca the following weekend to advance to the &#8220;Final Four.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Men&#8217;s Soccer vs. Carnegie Mellon, 1994</strong></p>
<p>In an NCAA Tournament first-round game hosted by Muhlenberg, regulation play and overtime went on without a goal. Thomas Auchenbach made the 10th and final penalty kick to give the Mules a 3-2 win in the shootout and send them to the second round for the first time in program history.</p>

<p><em>(This game also serves as proof that 20-year-old VHS tapes still work.)</em></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/soft1991.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2070" alt="softball 1991" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/soft1991.jpg" width="300" height="341" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/soft1991.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/soft1991-263x300.jpg 263w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Softball, 1989-92</strong></p>
<p>The softball team made a habit of going to the postseason in the late &#8217;80s and early &#8217;90s, and they also made a habit of winning games in dramatic fashion. The Mules posted walkoff wins against Wilkes in the 1989 NCAA Tournament (on an RBI single by Laura Williams), Mount Union twice in the 1990 NCAA Tournament (RBI single by Val Verenna and three-run triple/error by Kim Lapple) and Franklin &amp; Marshall in the 1991 MAC playoffs (RBI grounder by Karen Brown). The pick of the group, however, was a walkoff single by freshman Tara Molloy in the bottom of the eighth for a 4-3 win against Elizabethtown in the 1992 MAC championship game.</p>
<p><strong>Men&#8217;s Soccer vs. Johns Hopkins, 1987</strong></p>
<p>Six years away from becoming fierce Centennial Conference rivals, Muhlenberg and Hopkins played a wild MAC South championship game. The Mules took leads of 2-1 and 3-2 in the first two overtime periods (which were not sudden death at the time), only to have the Blue Jays tie the score both times. Off to a shootout the match went. With the entire Muhlenberg football team (which was practicing on the adjacent field) looking on, Bert Mukkulainen completed a perfect Mule run through the round of five PKs by converting the winning shot after the fourth Hopkins shooter missed high.</p>

			<p>It would have been great to give this week&#8217;s award to someone other than Cody Geyer. The junior speedster on the Muhlenberg football team has already won twice.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/defense_dickinson.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2056" alt="defense" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/defense_dickinson.jpg" width="375" height="329" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/defense_dickinson.jpg 375w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/defense_dickinson-300x263.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/defense_dickinson-341x300.jpg 341w" sizes="(max-width: 375px) 100vw, 375px" /></a>It would have been really cool to give it to someone on the defense, which put on another stellar performance in the Mules&#8217; 42-3 win against Dickinson on Saturday. Playing against the third-leading rushing team in the Centennial Conference, the defense allowed only 80 yards on 45 carries.</p>
<p>In the second half, every Red Devil possession ended in a punt, and one only one of those drives did Muhlenberg allow a first down. Dickinson snapped the ball eight times on first down in the second half and gained a total of 4 yards. In the third quarter, the Red Devils ran 14 plays for 15 yards.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg&#8217;s defense has allowed only two offensive touchdowns during the team&#8217;s current four-game winning streak. In Division III, the Mules rank 22nd in pass efficiency defense, 23rd in total defense and 24th in scoring defense.</p>
<p>Here are some top defensive plays from the Dickinson game:</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/szelongsack.wmv">Stephen Szelong sack</a></p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/feasterINT.wmv">John Feaster interception</a></p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/deladesack.wmv">Greg DeLade sack</a></p>
<p>But the signature play of the game, yet again, belonged to Geyer. With zeroes on the scoreboard after each team had punted on its first two possessions, Nick Palladino lofted a second-down pass down the left sideline, dropping it in perfectly beyond the cornerback and the safety, who was late in getting over. Geyer caught it in stride and raced into the end zone to complete the 62-yard play.</p>
<p>Geyer would add touchdowns on the Mules&#8217; next two possessions, and Muhlenberg rolled to an impressive win.</p>
<p>Here it is, the play of the week: <a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/Geyer62TD.wmv">Cody Geyer 62-yard touchdown</a></p>

<p>Scoring two goals in your last home game on Senior Day is pretty sweet. But it&#8217;s even sweeter when the goals help your team to a win that clinches a playoff berth. Graetzer helped extend her career and her teammates&#8217; season with two goals in a 4-0 shutout of Bryn Mawr. She broke a 0-0 tie just before halftime and scored again with about 16 minutes left for her second career multiple-goal game.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/palladinohs.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2042" alt="Nick Palladino" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/palladinohs.jpg" width="100" height="150" /></a>Male Athlete of the Week &#8211; Nick Palladino, Football</strong></p>
<p>One of several worthy candidates from the Mules&#8217; 42-3 win against Dickinson, Palladino had a quarterback rating of 257.3, completing 15 of 18 passes for 255 yards and three touchdowns while playing only one series into the second half. The first Mule quarterback to throw two 50-yard touchdown passes in a game since 2001, the freshman also ran for a touchdown.</p>

			<p><em>Two Muhlenberg teams will be competing for the Centennial Conference championships, two others have already qualified to do so, and two more will try to play their way in. Plus, football&#8217;s Homecoming and the start of winter sports.</em></p>
<p><strong>Cross Country at McDaniel for Centennial Conference Championships (Saturday, 11:00 and 12:00)</strong></p>
<p>The Mules will face strong competition at the conference meet, including several nationally ranked teams in both the men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s races. Last year, the women finished fourth and the men fifth.</p>
<p>Complete preview: <a href="http://www.muhlenberg.edu/main/athletics/fall13/1031.html">http://www.muhlenberg.edu/main/athletics/fall13/1031.html</a></p>

<p><strong>Volleyball vs. Swarthmore (Saturday, 12:00); vs. Moravian (Saturday, 4:00)</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg (18-10, 7-2) hosts two important matches &#8211; for different reasons &#8211; on the final day of the regular season. The Mules have clinched a CC playoff berth and can land a bye to the semifinals (where they would face McDaniel) if they can beat Swarthmore (15-11, 3-6). A loss could drop Muhlenberg to the 4-5 match, which it would host on Wednesday.</p>
<p>In the second match, the Mules will be playing for school pride (and possibly its first 20-win season since 2001) against a 10-20 Greyhound squad that had lost nine in a row heading into a Friday night match. Moravian took a 3-2 lead in the Matte Award race with a women&#8217;s soccer win on Wednesday, and the volleyball team has a chance to even the standings up.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg trails the all-time series against both Swarthmore (17-16) and Moravian (40-9) and has lost five straight to both.</p>

<p><strong>Football vs. Dickinson (Saturday, 1:00)</strong></p>
<p>Although it&#8217;s Family Weekend at Muhlenberg, it&#8217;s homecoming weekend for the football team, which has not played a home game in almost a month. The Mules (5-2, 4-2) have won each of their last three games by at least 20 points and will look to continue their roll.</p>
<p>Dickinson (3-4, 3-3) has the third-best rushing attack in the CC and attempted only seven passes in last week&#8217;s 38-31 win against McDaniel. But the Devils&#8217; starting quarterback, who ranks second among CC QBs in rushing yards, was injured last week. Muhlenberg is second in the CC against the run, allowing only 114.4 yards per game.</p>
<p>The Mules lead the all-time series, 41-25-2, and have taken 12 of the last 14 meetings, including a 61-21 win last year and a 12-0 shutout in the snow two years ago.</p>

<p><strong>Women&#8217;s Soccer vs. Bryn Mawr (Saturday, 1:00)</strong></p>
<p>Despite losing four in a row, Muhlenberg (6-10-1, 4-5) can clinch a CC playoff berth for the second straight year by defeating Bryn Mawr in its regular-season finale. If the Mules win, they will travel to either McDaniel or Dickinson for a first-round game on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Owls (2-14, 0-9) are winless in their last 17 CC contests and have scored only four goals all season, but they recently snapped a 13-game losing streak with an overtime win against Moravian, a team Muhlenberg just lost to.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg has won 19 straight meetings against Bryn Mawr to take a 20-2 series lead. The Owls have been shut out in their last eight trips to Allentown, dating back to 1996.</p>

<p><strong>Field Hockey vs. Haverford (Saturday, 6:00)</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg (8-8, 6-3) is in the CC playoffs for the first time since 2007 and, unless nationally ranked Ursinus unexpectedly loses to last-place Swarthmore, will face Haverford in a first-round game on Wednesday. The winner of this contest will get to host the rematch.</p>
<p>The Fords (9-7, 5-4) have clinched their fifth straight playoff berth; they reached the CC championship game in 2010 and last year. A Mule defense that is second in the CC in fewest goals allowed in league games (11) faces a Haverford offense has scored 14 goals in its last three games.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg leads the all-time series, 15-11, but Haverford has won four of the last five meetings.</p>

<p><strong>Men&#8217;s Soccer at McDaniel (Saturday, 3:30)</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg (8-7-1, 3-4-1) needs a win and lots of help to make the CC playoffs. But in such a competitive league, almost every game is close and anything is possible.</p>
<p>First and foremost, the Mules must defeat last-place McDaniel (7-6-3, 1-5-2). The Green Terror started off the season with five straight wins, earned a regional ranking and was 6-1-3 a month ago but has lost five of its last six.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg leads the all-time series, 32-7-1, and has never lost to McDaniel: The Mules&#8217; last series loss came in 2001 when the school was still known as Western Maryland. In 11 meetings since, Muhlenberg is 10-0-1 with a 18-1 scoring margin.</p>

<p><strong>Wrestling at Monarch Invitational (Saturday, 9:00)</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg opens its 2013-14 season with its annual trip to King&#8217;s for a 12-team tournament.</p>

			<p><em>Earlier this month, the Muhlenberg women&#8217;s lacrosse team ran in charity 5K race. Senior Veronica Maccia filed the following report:</em></p>
<p>It was a great day for running. The sun was shining and there was a cool breeze to keep us company as we ran to support those not as fortunate as us.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/10/wlaxbig_MB103013.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2029" alt="women's lax 5K" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/10/wlaxbig_MB103013.jpg" width="780" height="444" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/10/wlaxbig_MB103013.jpg 780w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/10/wlaxbig_MB103013-300x170.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/10/wlaxbig_MB103013-500x284.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" /></a></p>
<p>Every year, as a team, we choose a cause to support that we find important. For the past two years, we have been running for the Turning Point of the Lehigh Valley because as a team, we know how crucial it is to have support from those around you, especially in times of need. The Turning Point is a place for victims of abuse to find refuge. Its mission is to eliminate domestic violence, increase awareness and empower victims. This organization helps over 5,000 victims of domestic violence each year.</p>
<p>Even though the cause of the race was enough to make us put forth all of our effort and run as fast as we could, it was also helpful that we were all in great shape since we had been working really hard and pushing ourselves during our fall-ball season. The scenic route was another plus as we ran the 3-mile race. Throughout the run, there were dogs running around, people fishing and spectators cheering us on.</p>

<p>Of course, no day can go on without a hitch and the people who were in the front got a little lost and made a wrong turn. Thankfully, they realized it before it was too late.</p>
<p>As a team, doing things together really brings us closer and helps us create a bond that will help us be successful on the field. We are looking forward to future community services activities that we will be partaking in throughout the school year.</p>
