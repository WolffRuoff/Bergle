The Weinstein Co., the film&#8217;s distributing studio, announced that they will replace all R-rated prints of the film currently in theaters with a brand new PG-13 version. Starting next Friday, this teen-friendly version of the film will play in approximately 1,000 theaters nationwide. This is the first time a film has been released in theaters with a new rating since 1978&#8217;s &#8220;Saturday Night Fever,&#8221; although in the case of that film, the new PG version (downgraded from R) was released in theaters months later. In the case of &#8220;The King&#8217;s Speech,&#8221; which is still playing in wide release, the studio is simply pulling the current R-rated version from theaters and replacing all prints with this new PG-13 version. The Motion Picture Association of America, which is responsible for designating the ratings of films, originally gave &#8220;The King&#8217;s Speech&#8221; an R rating for &#8220;some language.&#8221; The reedited PG-13 version is so rated because of &#8220;language.&#8221; In the PG-13 cut, numerous uses of the &#8220;F-bomb&#8221; have either been muted or replaced with &#8220;s*it.&#8221;<span id="more-970"></span></p>
<p>In late February, MPAA chair Bob Pisnano and NATO (National Association of Theater Owners) president John Fithian co-signed a waiver permitting the Weinstein Co. to release this new version <em>without</em> the standard provision that it be released 90 days after the R-rated version was pulled from theaters. Prior to a few years ago, the possibility of this waiver did not exist, so &#8220;The King&#8217;s Speech&#8221; is the first time the waiver has been employed by a film studio. It seems clear the Weinstein Co. has made the effort to release a PG-13 version of the film in hopes of attracting more widespread revenue. An R rating limits film patrons under the age of 17 to only being sold a ticket when in the presence of a parent or guardian. With a PG-13 rating, however, no age limit exists in terms of ticket sales.</p>
<p>This re-rating seems to indicate the tremendous power role that the studio holds. It seems that, at least in this particular case, the studio is more interested in obtaining as much profit as possible rather than the film&#8217;s art. Not only did &#8220;The King&#8217;s Speech&#8221; receive extensive critical acclaim and win the Best Picture Oscar in its original form, but it also was very successful financially (the film has grossed $132.7 million in the United States already). From a logical standpoint, there seems to be no reason for the existence of the PG-13 version. The subject matter of &#8220;The King&#8217;s Speech&#8221; is inherently adult and, at least on first glance, it doesn&#8217;t seem like allowing teenagers to see the film unaccompanied will really change the film&#8217;s fortunes a considerable amount. The DVD is also scheduled for release on April 19, less than three weeks after the PG-13 re-release, perhaps further muting box office returns. The Weinstein Co.&#8217;s actions could have extensive repercussions throughout the film industry. If the PG-13 re-release of the film is at all successful, it may give studios incentives to lobotomize the content of future films in order to gain more audience-friendly ratings. What&#8217;s more, this issue seems to be stirring a debate regarding the preservation of the film&#8217;s original content. The filmmakers of &#8220;The King&#8217;s Speech&#8221; intended for the film to be seen in its original R rating, and some have spoken out against changing the film&#8217;s content, such as the film&#8217;s star Geoffrey Rush. Our group believes this change in the film&#8217;s rating to be someÂ  &#8220;bull&#8230;&#8221; Censorship should not stand, and filmmakers should be able to have their content embraced by audiences in the way dictated by the creators themselves, not the studios.</p>
