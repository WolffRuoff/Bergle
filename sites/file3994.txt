(2011, February 25). Reporters, publicists play game year-round. <em>Variety</em>. Retrieved from <a href="http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118032485?refcatid=1985">http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118032485?refcatid=1985</a>.</p>
<p>A new development in the relationship between Hollywood publicists and news journalists has heightened to a new level, regardless of the time of year. Publicists and news journalists often have agendas of different sorts; while publicists want to promote positive images of their clients, news journalists are constantly trying to find new stories, no matter what type of light is shed on the subjects of the investigation. In years prior, however, Hollywood publicists and entertainment journalists&#8217; goals would often converge during awards season. In the period of time from October to late February, in which all eyes and ears are focused on the &#8220;awards-season beast,&#8221; publicists and reporters often came to an unspoken agreement featuring &#8220;exclusives and firsts taking a backseat to smarter analysis and better access.&#8221; According to several of Hollywood&#8217;s leading publicity honchos, however, this temporary standstill in the conflicting interests of the two groups no longer exists. Reporting on important film news related to the awards race during the actual season is now commonplace. An example of this occurred last year, when news stories regarding <em>The Hurt Locker</em> producer Nicolas Chartier being banned from attending the awards as a result of an email blasting <em>Avatar</em> quickly circulated throughout the industry in the runup to the Oscars.<span id="more-916"></span></p>
<p>The advent of online technology and the role it has played in journalism has played an enormous role in the development of this year-long news cycle. According to Steve Elzer, senior VP of media relations at Sony Pictures Entertainment, &#8220;there is no question that the proliferation of blogs and online journalism has put enormous new pressure on publicists and journals alike.&#8221; Bloggers and online journalists&#8217; sole goal is often to report on the events of the industry,Â and the advent of social networking websites like Twitter makes it quite easy to keep up with current events of the entertainment world on a minute-by-minute basis. Because of the constant access to the industry&#8217;s developments, publicists and journalists must now both be on guard and vigilant in their pursuits throughout the calendar year, no longer having a break during the so-called &#8220;awards season.&#8221; This change in the publicity &#8220;game&#8221; within the film industry is reflective of the demands of mainstream society as a whole. As more and more technologies come to the forefront, the demand for the newest information at any time and in multiple capacities has increased exponentially.</p>
<p>In terms of power roles, journalists and publicists both fit into the &#8220;facilitator&#8221; role. Publicists are facilitators of the promotion of their clients&#8217; images both to the public and the industry itself. Journalists can be considered facilitators, as well, because they must relay information about newsworthy material to the public. There is often a substantial divide between the goals of publicists and journalists, especially in the film industry, as both groups are facilitators but attempting to facilitate entirely different types of information. According to Stan Rosenfield, a personal publicist who has handled Oscar campaigns for clients such as George Clooney and Helen Mirren, &#8220;journalists want certain stories from us, and when they don&#8217;t get (them), they are not happy with us. But if you want to be good at what you do, you need to have a meaningful relationship with the press.&#8221; When two separate entities like publicists and journalists, who play the same power role have conflicting interests but often have to work together, a &#8220;co-dependency&#8221; often emerges in the film industry. As the Oscar season continues, this relationship is often necessary in order to establish the facilitation efforts of both parties.</p>
