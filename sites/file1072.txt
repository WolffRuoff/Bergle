<p>In 2010 Trexler Library’s staff was given a challenge. &nbsp;Make the library  a place for  more than study time and books. &nbsp;Let’s make use of the  space.  Let’s put some fun in the library. &nbsp;Make it a destination.  The  staff from all departments of the library took up the challenge and  worked together on the first event –  Novemberfest 2010. &nbsp;We turned   Level A of the library into an arcade.   Multiple video games were set up  around the floor as well as carnival  and board games, and a fortune  telling station. WMUH was on hand with  music for the event. &nbsp;At the end  of the evening, fun had been had but  the event needed almost as many  people to work the games as played  them.  We could do better!  </p>

<p>Tim Clark, who was the Systems Librarian at the time, recommended hosting a trivia event. &nbsp;He organized his team and the planning began. &nbsp;Ninety minutes of trivia, snacks, and a grand prize basket for the highest scoring team. &nbsp;The library staff approached local businesses for prizes, and began marketing the event. Tim’s confidence waned a bit as the evening approached, and he offered to eat his left shoe if we made our goal of 10 teams. &nbsp;On February 16, 2011, Trexler Library held its first Trivia Night. &nbsp;Twelve teams were in attendance…we’re still waiting for Tim to eat that shoe!  </p>

<p style="text-align:left">Now held twice per year, the staff at Trexler Library continually work to improve Trivia Night.  New rounds are developed for each event, themes have been incorporated, decorations have escalated, and guest M.C.’s are garnered from various academic and business departments across campus, each adding their personalities and fun side to the evening.  Some past themes have inspired students to come in costume such as Halloween, Monster Mash, and Red Carpet Trivia. Other memorable evenings have included Inauguration Trivia, which was held during President Williams Inaugural weekend, and Jurassic Trivia which we promoted with a short video (<em><a href="https://www.facebook.com/muhlenbergtrexlerlibrary/videos/10158120838565621/">check it out on our Facebook page</a></em>).  </p>



<p>Trivia Night attracts between 80 and 130 participants with the Spring semester being the more popular. Teams of 3-6 members work together to achieve the highest score. &nbsp;Each member of the three highest scoring teams win Amazon Gift cards. &nbsp;There are also opportunities for individuals to win prizes during the evening.  Trivia Night is open to the Muhlenberg Community, which includes students, faculty and staff. &nbsp;</p>



<p>We hope to see you at our next Trivia Night on Monday, February 11<sup>th</sup>, when Dr. Erika Iyengar leads us in <em><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/2197873917129976/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Trivia From</a></em><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/2197873917129976/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)"> </a><em><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/2197873917129976/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">The Deep</a></em>. </p>
