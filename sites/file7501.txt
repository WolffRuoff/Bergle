								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I wake up in the morning, I roll over and grab my phone to instantly check my messages, emails, or social media. The internet has become a part of my everyday life, and I normally think of the internet as a positive thing; I can connect with my family and high school friends from a different state. However, many people fail to notice the negative aspect of technology and the impacts it will have on us in the future. Michael Keshen’s infographic highlights statistics about online activity and social media sites in a seemingly positive way, since the graphics are brightly colored and his word choice is appealing to a younger demographic. On YouTube, CGP Grey created a video entitled “Humans Need Not Apply,” discussing the inevitable “bot” (robot) takeover of human jobs (CGP Grey, 2014). There are bots mentioned in the video that have the ability to learn, which is frightening because this means that bots may become more capable than humans. In the future, it will become more cost effective for companies to use bots as opposed to human labor. For example, the online economy is only in its early stages, yet $717,808,219 is spent online everyday and over 100 million apps are downloaded (Keshen, 2014). These numbers are only expected to grow as technology becomes more efficient. However, the rest of our economy will be taken over by bots, leaving much of the population unemployed. What happens once humans start losing their jobs to bots? What will we have left to work towards?</p>
