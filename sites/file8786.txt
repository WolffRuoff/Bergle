								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Way too often does Apple come out with a new “must have” product. The most recent product is the iPhone 6S, but that’s not what I am here to discuss, it is all about the new Apple Watch product. Its price ranges from a reasonable $349 to an outrageous $17,000, “The fancy cases and straps are nice, but it’s the software that I’m sold on” (OCHS, 2015). Does not matter the strap fabric its the content that the watch is able to provide you which makes you forget about your previous desire to have the fanciest watch. With just a few swipes left and right, up and down you basically have your phone smashed into a small square on your wrist. You receive notifications just as you would on your iPhone. Siri, Apple Pay, Phone, Messages, Mail, and Calendar are all accessible through the easy use of your new Apple Watch. Everything works so smoothly and easily you quickly forget and don’t even care about what the mere strap is made out of, it is all about the technology itself. Even with all of these perks of having an Apple Watch there were minor concerns. The battery life like many technological products is something customers worry about. OCHS was one of those worrying customers, “Apple is good about not overestimating battery life and from what I saw in my demo, these figures seem reasonable. The watch is designed to get you the info you want quickly, both in how the information is presented and how easy it is to move between it” (OCHS, 2015). The Apple Watch highlights the quick fast motions and minimal time taking it requires to access any apple, this allows customers to find what they are looking for in record timing only using up little battery life at a time.</p>
<p>As more people begin to purchase Apple Watches the amount of time people spend on their cell phone may actually reduce. Everyday people check their phones constantly whether or not they are waiting for a text, or checking social media, or trying to call someone, people are on their phones way too much and thats that, me included of course. With notifications that are sent to your phone but received on your Apple Watch the constant pulling out the cell phone may not stay such a bad habit.</p>
