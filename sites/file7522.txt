					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Although the Internet has allowed us to be more global, our digital footprint may still be limited by our region. Much of your history developed in China, so using an search engine that is dominant in North America will make it difficult to find information. Looking at Google&#039;s mission: &quot;Google&#039;s mission is to organize the world&#039;s information and make it universally accessible and useful.&quot; That is a lofty goal, but there are a great number of restrictions and obstacles that don&#039;t allow them to organize all the word&#039;s information. Culture and societal norms also differ from country to country, which will also impact what kind of information is available.&lt;/p&gt;
