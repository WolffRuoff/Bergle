								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At one point in most peoples lives, they will be impacted by technology in one way or another. For me, technology has almost always been in my life. For as long as I can remember I have had a form of technology in my possession that  has impacted my life in many different ways.   One of the very first pieces of technology that I remember using was a portable CD player. I can remember as a kid carrying this thing around everywhere I went as my most prized possession, as if it was made of gold or something. I had a carrying pouch with extra slots for different CD&#8217;s I would want to listen to and a place to carry my giant head phones. Now a days kids have iPods, iPads , and any other type of music player available on the market that is less than half the size of my old CD player and needs none of the extra accessories. But that is besides the point, this CD player was more than just a music playing device to me. It was a factor in my childhood that has ended up shaping some of my interests in music today. As a child my cousin used to baby sit my brother and I and he was huge into classic rock. He loved the bands such as the Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, and AC/DC. They  were always playing in his car, at the house, any time he could he was playing classic rock. This is how I fell in love with rock music. I starting asking him for CD&#8217;s that I can burrow and the collection kept growing. Ever since then I have always been in love with classic rock. It is mostly what I listen to today and it helps me in many ways. It helps me relieve stress in overwhelming times. It allows me to shutout what is going on around me and focus on my studies and it even gives me different messages that I can draw from each individual song. This early technology in my life also gives me a gateway to some old memories. I can remember sitting down with my cousin every couple of weeks and going over songs that he would burn on a disk for me. I had to convince him to let some explicit songs go but had to promise not to tell my mother. I also remember times me and my brother would get into fights over who got to use the CD player, I guess not much has changed from that stand point. This CD player has affected me in many positive ways that goes much deeper than just listening to music.  As you can see I have had technology in my life for a long time and this is how technology has had a very positive impact on my life even from some of my earliest years.</p>
