								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Autism Spectrum Disorder is a developmental disability that affects many children as young as two or three years old. Some of the characteristic hallmarks of autism are difficulties with social interactions, language and cognitive delays or difficulties, and restricted, repetitive, and stereotyped behaviors. Every person with autism has a different experience and autism is often described as a wide spectrum. The spectrum is labeled from low functioning to high functioning. People with “low functioning” autism are usually described as having more severe symptoms while people with “high functioning” autism are described as having less severe symptoms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There are many issues with the way we label autism and the way we classify and categorize people with autism. Although the concept of a spectrum is helpful in understanding autism, oftentimes people with autism do not fit neatly onto the spectrum and this may be extremely frustrating for them. There are a multitude of symptoms and differing severity of each symptom that create a different combination for each person who is diagnosed with autism. It is almost as if there is a spectrum for each symptom and each person with autism fits onto each spectrum in their own way. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I believe thinking of autism in this way makes it much easier for people to try and understand what having autism is truly like. Of course, people without the disorder will never fully understand what it is like for people with it. That being said, it is important for the general population to try their best to be informed and accommodating in order to have a fuller understanding of what people with autism experience. </span></p>
