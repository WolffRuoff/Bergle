(22 February 2011). Interscope&#8217;s Jimmy Iovine fighting the 24-bit fight. <em>Billboard</em>. Retrieved from <a href="http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/industry/digital-and-mobile/interscope-s-jimmy-iovine-fighting-the-24-1005044072.story#">http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/industry/digital-and-mobile/interscope-s-jimmy-iovine-fighting-the-24-1005044072.story#</a></p>
<p>Forget CDs! The real format war in the recording industry is between 16-bit and 24-bit audio files, and some industry executives are taking the 24-bit side. Interscope CEO Jimmy Iovine and Columbia Records Co-President Rick Rubin are pressuring other labels to start releasing audio files to iTunes in the higher-quality 24-bit format, ostensibly in an effort to improve the user’s experience. Unfortunately for users, the price of the new format may increase along with the quality.</p>
<p><span id="more-921"></span></p>
<p>But which users will buy these new 24-bit files? In a world where CDs still form the bulk of the industry’s profits, it seems silly for industry executives to promote an upgrade from an iTunes file format that nobody’s complaining about. However, it’s not the first format upgrade the industry’s initiated. In fact, the industry aggressively promoted CDs back in the late eighties and ended up with a years-long boom in profits as everyone switched to the new format. Maybe industry executives are hoping to mirror their success with CDs by promoting another “higher-quality” format for which they can charge more.</p>
<p>The future of this plan, however, hinges on Iovine and Rubin’s success in recruiting other industry executives to their side. As producers, both executives worry about their companies’ future profitability, and history shows that every media company promoting its own personal format isn’t conducive to higher profits for anyone. Both surely remember the <a href="http://www.mediacollege.com/video/format/compare/betamax-vhs.html">disastrous VHS-Beta war of the eighties</a>. The industry’s continued existence may rely on multiple producers banding together under one format.</p>
<p>It’s also possible that, after alienating the bulk of their digital fan base with <a href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2008/09/proving-file-sh/">frivolous file-sharing lawsuits</a>, record industry executives like Iovine and Rubin are eager to prove that they’re still on the users’ side. What better way to do this than to don the public advocate hat and pretend that what’s good for the record industry is what’s good for America? After all, the higher-quality music may enrich users’ overall experience—and would probably sound <em>great</em> under some of Iovine’s <a href="http://www.beatsbydre.com/">“Beats by Dre” line headphones</a>!</p>
<p>The real linchpin in this scheme is, of course, <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/">Apple</a>. Industry executives can release music in any format they want, but Apple’s software and devices need to play them. As music distribution and exhibition responsibilities pass from “one-stops” to iTunes, Apple’s cooperation becomes a crucial component of any business strategy in the music industry. Iovine is working with Apple and says they’ve been “great,” which must be the new euphemism for “greedy.” Everyone who understands Apple knows they won’t agree to reconfigure their software and devices to run a new, higher-priced format without reconfiguring the way they manage profits from sales of that new, higher-priced music. Financial details are sketchy, but with industry executives and Apple executives (is there a difference anymore?) on either end of the bargaining table, the negotiations should be intense.</p>
<p>The real issue, however, revolves around whether music fans care more about quality of music or convenience of access. Another executive at Sony pointed out that users historically care more about convenience. And as every Internet user knows, accessing music online has never been more convenient. If a new 24-bit format became standard right now, it’s likely that the only major change would be more 24-bit files on <a href="http://thepiratebay.org/">Pirate Bay</a>.</p>
<p>Maybe industry executives should focus on getting people to pay for the existing 16-bit format before promoting new digital formats.</p>
