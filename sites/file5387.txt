<p><em><strong>As we move into the next chapter of the Sedehi Diversity Project here are five of the most valuable things I have learned from SDP in my past two+ years interacting with the project.</strong> </em></p>
<p>This project has been the direct cause for so many of the decisions that I made within the past year of my life both personal and educationally. This project pushed me to explore the intersection where Anthropology and Theatre meet and explore how those disciplines, that are often thought to be polar opposites, meet to create something pretty powerful. This project has thought me the value of community engagement as well as the value in engaging in critical conversations about difference, power and privilege. This project has taught me so much already and as we head into this new year, here is a list of the five most valuable things I have learned while engaging with the Sedehi Diversity project in the past two years. Hopefully after I have finished directing the project, I will have even more things to add to this list, but for now I am pretty grateful for these five!</p>
<p><b><i>#1 The project acts as a reflection of who we are as a collective</i></b></p>
<p>The project reflects us as a community, but also acts as a mirror for the individual. It&#8217;s this sort of amazing phenomenon that happens in the project, through seeing yourself as a member of something bigger than yourself it can, and often does, bring you closer to understanding yourself.</p>
<p><b><i>#2</i></b> <b><i>SDP is highly invested in collaboration</i></b></p>
<p>The project highlights the importance of community and that when we link up as wellwishers and accomplices in the work of social equity, we gain power. With the current political climate, I think that this is one of the most important lessons the project can teach. You can never do enough social advocacy work but knowing that we have a network of intelligent, critical thinkers to help fight against the powers of inequity is so important.</p>
<p><b><i>#3</i></b> <b><i>Get into your heart and out of your head. </i></b></p>
<p>Through the work of the project, I think you really begin to understand that there may be a difference between how you are conditioned to think about situations of inequity and the logical way to view these situations. Through beginning to understanding that difference, you can begin to break down your own personal biases, no matter how explicit or implicit those feelings may be. Acknowledging your faults can lead to those thoughts manifesting into helpful, bridge-buidling connections.</p>
<p>SDP ’15 alum, Zoë Briggs, puts it nicely when she says, we are given a script that we are designed to follow and that is the conditioned first thought and the second thought, the thought that is descriped as the questioning thought, that is the thought that actually reflects how we are feeling. The project has certainly helped me develop a more nuanced understanding of bias, racism, and conditioned ways of being in our “worlds”.</p>
<p><b><i>#4 This project is designed to enact change and through hard work and determination those changes CAN be enacted. </i></b></p>
<p>Last year during Orientation weekend we saw President John Williams release a statement announcing that he was rescinding the existing Protest and Demonstration Policy! This was a policy that was put into place by previous President, Randy Helm and was widely disapproved of by many members in the campus community. This was such an exciting moment for the entire college! Being able to see that the voices of people on campus were being heard very clearly was so powerful!</p>
<p><b><i>#5 Humility is the key in seeing humanity. </i></b></p>
<p>This is so closely linked to the idea that through understanding our community we begin to develop a better understanding of ourselves. I think many of us in the ensemble last year had the same mentality: that we are all going to mess up, we are all going to say something racist or classist or ableist etc. and that being able to admit your faults and biases is the only true way to grow. Humility like this is what leads to seeing your <i>own</i> humanity as well as the humanity of <i>others</i>.</p>
<p>I look forward to seeing how my list of nuggets of knowledge that the project has blessed me with adapts and grows in the coming weeks! I look forward to the addition of more people into these important conversations.</p>
