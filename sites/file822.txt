It is the legal exception to copyright that affords certain privileges to the buyer of a book. The buyer may sell, rent, give away, or even destroy a book. That is the privilege of the buyer.<\/p>\n<p>What had been proposed in the recent Supreme Court case was that this doctrine would no longer extend to foreign-published works. The Supreme Court ruled otherwise 6 to 3. For libraries, the ruling means that they can continue to collect foreign titles, knowing that these titles can be checked out by library patrons and interlibrary loaned to borrowers at other institutions. Without the doctrine of first sale, such time-honored practices of checkout and interlibrary loan, for foreign titles at least, would have had to end.
