			<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/09/germaskehs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1832" alt="Christine Germaske" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/09/germaskehs.jpg" width="100" height="150" /></a>Tomorrow night, the Muhlenberg field hockey team will try to get a jump start on the rest of the Centennial Conference when it hosts McDaniel in the first league game of the year (most other CC teams open up conference play on Saturday or later). And if there’s one player on the team who knows plenty about getting an early start, it’s Christine Germaske.</p>
<p>The junior forward spent the summer interning with Scott &amp; Todd in the Morning, the popular radio show hosted by veterans Scott Shannon and Todd Pettengill on WPLJ 95.5 in New York.</p>
<p>“It was fun. I loved it and really loved everyone I worked with,” said Germaske.</p>
<p>The only downside was the hours. Germaske would wake up at 2:50 a.m. at her home in Raritan, N.J., and take a 4:00 train from New Brunswick to Manhattan. She worked from 5:00 to 10:00 and arrived back home at noon to take a nap, her full day of work complete.</p>
<p>Germaske discovered the opportunity on the Internet, interviewed with one of the producers and found out just a few days later that she had gotten the job. She was one of five interns and did not receive any pay or academic credit for her time. To make some money over the summer, she worked at a J. Crew store some night and on weekends.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/09/germaske_degraw.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1833" alt="with Gavin DeGraw" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/09/germaske_degraw.jpg" width="450" height="349" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/09/germaske_degraw.jpg 450w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/09/germaske_degraw-300x232.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/09/germaske_degraw-386x300.jpg 386w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a>So what did her duties entail? When she arrived at 5:00, her first job was to put together a packet of newspaper clippings for Scott and Todd to talk about on the air. During the show, she worked the phones, taking listener comments and occasionally passing them on to the hosts as well as picking up the phone for on-air contests.</p>
<p>Then there were trips to pick up items for the hosts, including Todd’s daily Diet Coke. Germaske also got to meet in-studio guests like musicians Gavin DeGraw <em>(pictured above)</em> and Demi Lovato and television health guru Dr. Oz.</p>
<p>“It was cool to work with celebrities,” Germaske said. “People think they’re selfish and demanding, but they were all really nice. I didn’t expect that.”</p>
<p>Germaske, who scored her second goal of the season in last night’s 5-1 win against King’s, made it on air on several occasions. Once, she was sent to SoHo (her first subway ride) to stand in line for a cronut, the croissant-doughnut hybrid that became all the rage this year. While she was waiting, Scott and Todd called her to ask her about the type of people who were in line.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/09/germaske_kings.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1834" alt="Christine Germaske" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/09/germaske_kings.jpg" width="300" height="575" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/09/germaske_kings.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/09/germaske_kings-156x300.jpg 156w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>When she exited the store, Germaske was interviewed by a television station about her cronut experience, making for a memorable day.</p>
<p>Another time, Germaske sat in with the hosts and producers to provide another voice for a morning discussion on topics such as the hit song “Blurred Lines.”</p>
<p>“I was there to laugh or add input, but I didn’t know how to just jump in!” she said. “I was like, I’m just a 20-year-old girl and you’ve been doing this a long time.”</p>
<p>Germaske admitted a little nervousness at being on the air on a popular show airing in a big city. “I was trying not to think about how many people were listening,” she said. “You just have to think that you’re having a normal conversation with the other people in the room.”</p>
<p>Germaske’s last day at the station was August 2 – right before she left for Europe with her Mule teammates. And although she sees her future in business, not necessarily show business, she did learn many valuable life lessons from her summer internship.</p>
<p>“I learned professionalism – you have to act like a grownup,” she said. “And I learned people skills, and the ability to work with people who are older than you, and being able to put a smile on every morning even though it was 5:00.</p>
<p>“I also learned about the ability to produce work quickly, and to be able to drop what you were doing to get something for someone and then go back to what you were doing.</p>

<p><strong>Men’s Soccer vs. Rutgers-Camden (Friday, 5:00) and vs. Neumann (Saturday, 5:00)</strong></p>
<p>Men’s soccer is the only team at home this weekend, and it will face some tough competition. Rutgers-Camden was 17-2-3 last year, falling to York on penalty kicks in the second round of the NCAA Tournament, and is ranked 14<sup>th</sup> in the NSCAA preseason poll. Neumann is coming off a 12-7-3 season that included a bid to the ECAC South Tournament. The Mules were 11-5 last year.</p>

<p>Muhlenberg will travel down Route 309 for its first matches of the season. Of the Mules’ four opponents, Cabrini had the best record last year, going 20-10 and earning a bid to the ECAC South Tournament. DeSales (13-18) and Ithaca (13-15) both qualified for their conference playoffs, and Albright finished 7-15. The Mules (17-11) played a five-set match against DeSales last year, coming back from a 2-0 deficit to win the fifth set, 15-13.</p>

			<p><em>Profiles of senior Muhlenberg athletes are published in game programs in the sports of field hockey, football, soccer, volleyball, basketball, wrestling, baseball, softball, lacrosse and tennis, usually on that sport&#8217;s Senior Day.</em></p>
<p><em>As part of the Year in Review, here are some of the best responses in the Q&amp;A profiles from the fall athletes. Tomorrow: winter and spring athletes.</em></p>
<p><strong>Chris Galletta, Football</strong></p>
<p><strong>How did you get started playing football and what’s your first memory of playing? </strong>I began playing football when I was in third grade, and my earliest memory was when I got called for a holding penalty during a game and began crying.</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Murphy, Football</strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s it like being teammates with Chris Galletta? </strong>It’s been interesting to say the least. He’s the only person I know who, within five minutes of meeting him, will ask if you want him to help you with your resume. He stands by all of his opinions 100%, and it is impossible to even try to win an argument with him. But in all seriousness, he is very smart and will be very successful after the season. I wish him the very best.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/05/bisbing_yir.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1771" title="Garrett Bisbing" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/05/bisbing_yir.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="386" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/05/bisbing_yir.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/05/bisbing_yir-233x300.jpg 233w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Garrett Bisbing, Football</strong></p>
<p><strong>Your dad played as a lineman for Muhlenberg. Did you always want to follow in his footsteps? </strong>My dad was an all-conference player for the Mules and was a part of a Centennial Conference championship himself. I grew up coming to Muhlenberg on Saturdays for football games. I never really thought about coming here until my senior year. It’s nice to be able to say that we both were a part of championship teams at the same school.</p>
<p><strong>Tim Vogel, Football</strong></p>
<p><strong>Who has had the biggest influence on you throughout your life? </strong>My grandparents have easily been my biggest influence throughout my life. My grandparents came over from Ireland to create a new and better life for their family. This taught me that if you have a dream and work as hard as you can to achieve that dream, anything is possible. </p>
<p><strong>Dan Deighan, Football</strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s one thing on your bucket list? </strong>I want to learn how to play guitar. Ryan Murphy tells me he taught Carlos Santana everything he knows, so I’m looking forward to taking lessons from him.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/05/wilson_yir.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1772" title="Bryan Wilson" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/05/wilson_yir.jpg" alt="" width="261" height="350" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/05/wilson_yir.jpg 261w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/05/wilson_yir-223x300.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 261px) 100vw, 261px" /></a>Bryan Wilson, Football</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do you have anything embarrassing on your iPod? </strong>I have to admit that I mix it up sometimes and have Justin Bieber on my iPod. Many people would consider this embarrassing, but I am a full-fledged Belieber.</p>
<p><strong>Shane O&#8217;Connor, Football</strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s the most memorable game you’ve played in during your Muhlenberg career? </strong>Beating Gettysburg in overtime during my sophomore year as well as clinching the conference championship against Ursinus at home were great games to be a part of. However, I would have to say the Franklin &amp; Marshall game this year for Duke’s 100<sup>th</sup> win was the most memorable. He is an amazing coach and experiencing that with him is something I will remember forever.</p>
<p><strong>John Merklinger, Football</strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s it like being teammates with Shane O’Connor? </strong>“Shane-O” is more than just a teammate to me. He is more like a brother – someone who I can always count on. Shane is one of the most talented ball players I’ve ever played with or seen. He was a quarterback in high school and had never played defense, but his transition to safety really shows how gifted he is. Since making the move to the dark side, he’s become one of the best defensive backs in the Centennial Conference. He also saves lives during the summer down at the Jersey Shore as a lifeguard. He puts David Hasselhoff to shame with his killer good looks and “Dude, I’m such a beach bro,” attitude.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/05/dornenburg_yir.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1769" title="Kristen Dornenburg" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/05/dornenburg_yir.jpg" alt="" width="294" height="385" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/05/dornenburg_yir.jpg 294w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/05/dornenburg_yir-229x300.jpg 229w" sizes="(max-width: 294px) 100vw, 294px" /></a>Kristen Dornenburg, Field Hockey</strong></p>
<p><strong>How did you get started playing field hockey and what’s your first memory of playing? </strong>I started playing in fourth grade because my sister played and obviously I wanted to be just like her. I don’t know if this is my first memory, but one of my earlier ones is losing to one of our elementary school rivals, Chatham Park, and vowing never to play goalie again to my coach and parents. Obviously, I took that vow very seriously.</p>
<p><strong>Nate Squire, Men&#8217;s Soccer</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tell us about your internship with Lehigh Valley Animal Hospital. </strong>Coach Topping got me in touch with Dr. Ervin, the Moravian soccer coach’s wife, and I’ve been shadowing at Lehigh Valley Animal Hospital ever since. It’s been a great experience – I’m not only getting to learn a lot but I’m also enjoying it immensely. As I’m writing this, I’m about to head in to see Topper’s dog get neutered &#8230; a little revenge for those preseason fitness workouts!</p>
<p><strong>Kyle Plifka, Men&#8217;s Soccer</strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s one possession you couldn’t live without? </strong>Jon Majoros.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/05/moretto_yir.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1770" title="Jillian Moretto" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/05/moretto_yir.jpg" alt="" width="297" height="350" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/05/moretto_yir.jpg 297w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/05/moretto_yir-254x300.jpg 254w" sizes="(max-width: 297px) 100vw, 297px" /></a>Jillian Moretto, Women&#8217;s Soccer</strong></p>
<p><strong>How did you get started playing soccer and what’s your first memory of playing? </strong>Kicking balls at my older brother was always a hobby of mine, so when I discovered it was an actual sport, I was all for it. One of my earliest memories of playing is running around aimlessly on the field in a recreational league, where the thrill of scoring a goal and orange slices during halftime were the highlight to every Saturday. </p>
<p><strong>Alyssa Meola, Women&#8217;s Soccer</strong></p>
<p><strong>How do you get pumped up before a game? </strong>I usually listen to music and I like to jump around a lot and sing the lyrics during warmups.  When I’m on the bus listening to my iPod, I always listen to Al Pacino’s speech from “Any Given Sunday” and Kenny Chesney’s song “The Boys of Fall,” which includes inspirational speeches from many different coaches. Both of these speeches remind me that being a college athlete is not only a privilege that I am lucky enough to have, but also that one day I will no longer have the opportunity to play, so I need to take advantage of what I have left.</p>

This year, Dani Beiser, a freshman on the field hockey team from Cupertino, Calif., takes the 49ers side, and Terrence Dandridge, a senior on the football team from Baltimore, represents the Ravens.</p>

<div><strong></strong> </div>
<div><strong>How far do you live from your team’s home stadium?</strong></div>
<div>DB: About a half hour south of Candlestick Park.</div>
<div>TD: 25 minutes.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>How many games have you gone to?</strong></div>
<div>DB: A few every season, tickets are hard to get.</div>
<div>TD: 4.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>On a scale of 1 to 10, how big of a fan are you?</strong></div>
<div>DB: Probably an 8. Love watching and love the team but I know there are many more diehard fans.</div>
<div>TD: 10.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>How do you feel about Colin Kaepernick and Ray Lewis?</strong></div>
<div>DB: Colin Kaepernick is a young new leader for the Niners and brings an element of surprise and great energy to the team. He also is talented at reading the field which makes him really hard to defend.</div>
<div>TD: I would rather have a veteran almost-retired linebacker like Ray Lewis because he has an in-depth analysis of the game and is such a great motivator on the team to help other players perform well at the professional level.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>Are you doing anything special for the game?</strong></div>
<div>DB: Hanging out and watching with friends.</div>
<div>TD: I’m having a Super Bowl party with my friends at school.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>Who wins and what’s the score?</strong></div>
<div>DB: Niners obviously win 28-24!</div>
<div>TD: 24-20 Ravens win.</div>

<p>It’s not that the sophomore spoke up in the pregame meetings &#8211; although the all-conference forward is one of the team’s leaders on the field. The Mules heard their teammate in a recorded version of the national anthem.</p>
<p>Even though she’s never had a voice lesson, Thies is a veteran singer. She has been involved in musical theater and singing with her father’s band Doghouse since she was 5. Thies traveled all over her home state of New Jersey performing with the Paper Mill Playhouse and says she has been in more than 50 musicals, with roles ranging from Elphaba in <em>Wicked</em> to a Bad Girl in <em>Suessical</em> to Jack’s mother in <em>Into the Woods</em>.</p>

<p>“It got a lot of hits in a short period of time, so my Mom said I should record some popular songs,” she said.</p>
<p>Thies’ YouTube channel (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/kthiesx3lax">http://www.youtube.com/user/kthiesx3lax</a>) now features her covers of songs by artists such as Lady Gaga, Adele, Jason Mraz and Christina Perri.</p>
<p>One of the many visitors to the channel was Muhlenberg field hockey coach Megan Eddinger.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/12/thies_fieldhockey.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1494" title="Kayleigh Thies" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/12/thies_fieldhockey.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="523" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/12/thies_fieldhockey.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/12/thies_fieldhockey-172x300.jpg 172w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>“Coach saw my videos, and I’m always singing and being goofy at practice, so she asked me if I wanted to sing the anthem,” said Thies, who sung it at her high school basketball games. Being on the field with her teammates for pregame and lineup introductions was important to Thies, so rather than sing it live each time, she recorded the national anthem in one of the Life Sports Center classrooms.</p>
<p>On the second take, she wrapped up the final version (<a title="Kayleigh Thies national anthem" href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/12/kayleigh-thies-national-anthem.m4a" target="_blank">click here to listen</a>), which made its debut before the Mules’ game against Washington College on October 6 &#8211; her 20<sup>th</sup> birthday.</p>
<p>“It was kind of motivating,” said Thies of hearing her recording before a game for the first time. “I got to show people that I have this talent and I also play sports. Some people who sing, that’s all they do. It was a way for me to show that I have a broad spectrum of things that I do.</p>
<p>“And it also pumped a lot of my teammates up.”</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s next for Thies? A tryout for <em>American Idol</em>, <em>X-Factor</em> or <em>The Voice</em>? Going from Team Mule to Team Cee Lo?</p>
<p>“People always tell me I should try out,” she said. “A lot of the auditions are in August, and that’s when field hockey starts. So maybe after college.”</p>
<p>Or maybe she’ll just keep singing for fun. “I don&#8217;t know if I could do it as a career,” said Thies. “Right now it’s just a stress reliever for me.”</p>

			<p><em>The last weekend of October means falling leaves, Halloween, nasty weather in the forecast &#8211; and the fall sports seasons winding down. Two Muhlenberg teams will end their seasons tomorrow, while two others hope to continue theirs.</em></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-104" title="Mule Marquee Matchup" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="237" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg 350w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1-300x203.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" /></a>Women&#8217;s Soccer at Ursinus (7:30)</strong></p>
<p>This is the only game in which a Muhlenberg team can chart its own playoff course. With a win, the Mules are in &#8211; although, since the only team that can catch them (Dickinson) plays at noon, by the time this game kicks off they might be in already!</p>
<p>Muhlenberg (7-8-2, 5-3-1) is in fifth place in the Centennial Conference. Dickinson (11-5, 5-4) needs a win against Franklin &amp; Marshall and a Mule loss or tie to snatch away the final playoff spot. If the Mules win, they will face the loser of the Haverford-Swarthmore game in the first round (or Swarthmore if that game ends in a tie).</p>
<p>Although Ursinus (3-8-4, 0-5-4) is winless in CC play, it did take Haverford and Dickinson to double overtime.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg leads the all-time series, 13-6, but the Bears have won the last two meetings &#8211; including a 2010 game in Collegeville in which the Mules needed a win to stay alive in the playoff race.</p>

<p><strong>Field Hockey at Ursinus (12:00)</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg (9-6, 4-5) closes out a season of great improvement with a chance to beat eight-time defending champion Ursinus (9-7, 5-4) for the first time ever. The Bears need a win and help to make the playoffs.</p>

<p><strong>Volleyball at Ursinus (12:00)</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s the last match of the season for the Mules (16-11, 3-6), who have a chance to reach 17 wins for the first time since 2008. They won a total of 16 matches the last two years. Ursinus (7-16, 2-7) has lost to Muhlenberg eight straight times.</p>
<p><strong>Football at Dickinson (1:00)</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg (5-2, 4-2) plays a road game for the first time in almost a month against a Red Devil team coming off a comeback overtime win against McDaniel. It&#8217;s been feast or famine for Dickinson (3-4, 3-3): It lost big to to nationally ranked Hobart (31-0) and Johns Hopkins (49-0), but its other five games were all decided by eight points or fewer.</p>
<p>The Mules lead the all-time series, 40-25-2, and have won four of the last five meetings, including last season&#8217;s 12-0 &#8220;Snowtober&#8221; game.</p>

<p><strong>Men&#8217;s Soccer at Ursinus, 5:00</strong></p>
<p>The Mules (10-5, 5-4) enter the final day of the regular season needing a win or tie and a Johns Hopkins loss OR a win and a JHU draw to make the playoff field. The Blue Jays play at Washington at 7:00.</p>
<p>Ursinus (5-11, 1-7) has lost seven straight CC contests since opening with a win against Gettysburg and has allowed a league-worst 24 goals in conference play.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg has an all-time record of 18-0-1 against Ursinus in CC play. The tie, however, came in Collegeville in 2006 when the Mules needed a win to secure a home playoff game.</p>

			<p><em>Offense wins reputation, defense wins championships &#8211; and sometimes defense wins recognition. Check out these spectacular defensive plays by Mule athletes last week.</em></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/10/dornenburghs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1433" title="Kristen Dornenburg" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/10/dornenburghs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Female Play of the Week &#8211; Kristen Dornenburg saves of penalty strokes</strong></p>
<p>Dornenburg, the senior goalie for the Muhlenberg field hockey team, faced four penalty strokes in two games last week and saved three of them &#8211; including two in a 15-second span against Swarthmore. The stops came in the first 10 minutes of the game and prevented the Garnet from taking an early lead, which would prove crucial when the Mules went on to win, 1-0.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/10/dornenburg_saves.wmv">Click here for video of Dornenburg&#8217;s saves</a>.</p>

<p>Johnson, a senior inside linebacker, showed incredible reflexes in the third quarter of Saturday&#8217;s football game against Juniata. The Eagles trailed 28-7 and were driving for a touchdown when they faced a third-and-10 at the Muhlenberg 27. They set up a screen pass to the right, but Johnson, who was getting blocked just a few yards away from the quarterback, leaped and somehow caught the ball for his second interception of the season. Ten plays later, the Mules scored a touchdown, and they went on to win, 35-14.</p>

			<p><em>The last busy fall Saturday of the fall sports season at Muhlenberg is a big one for several teams. Of the five teams at home, four are playing Gettysburg in contests that have playoff implications for the Mules. It&#8217;s hard to single out just one as the Marquee Matchup, but we&#8217;ll try &#8230;</em></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-104" title="Mule Marquee Matchup" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="237" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg 350w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1-300x203.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" /></a>Women&#8217;s Soccer vs. Gettysburg (4:00)</strong></p>
<p>This game pits two teams that are in great position for making the Centennial Conference playoffs. Gettysburg (10-4, 6-1) is tied for first place with Johns Hopkins, and Muhlenberg (7-6-2, 5-2-1) is right behind in third place.</p>
<p>The Bullets clinch a playoff berth with a win or a tie, and the Mules secure a postseason spot with a win.</p>
<p>Gettysburg leads the Conference with 21 goals scored in league matches, while Muhlenberg has allowed only two goals to CC opponents &#8211; none in the last 470 minutes.</p>
<p>The Bullets are ranked fourth in the region by the NSCAA and seventh in the region by the NCAA. When the final horn blows, the Mules will have played seven of the 10 teams in this week’s NSCAA Mid-Atlantic rankings: Messiah (1), Johns Hopkins (3), Gettysburg (4), Swarthmore (5), Haverford (6), Dickinson (8) and Wilkes (10). Muhlenberg is 3-3 against these ranked opponents, with two of the losses coming by one goal.</p>
<p align="left">Gettysburg won at home the last two years to extend its series lead to 14-7-2, although since 2001 Muhlenberg has the upper hand, 7-5-1. The Bullets have not won at Varsity Field since 2005.</p>

<p align="left">Muhlenberg&#8217;s last home appearance of the season features an important match against Gettysburg, which the Mules (15-9, 3-5) must win if they are to have a shot at making the playoffs. The Bullets (14-10, 5-2), who lost to Washington in five sets, still have to play CC co-leaders Franklin &amp; Marshall and Johns Hopkins.</p>
<p align="left">Gettysburg has won 25 of 27 all-time meetings against Muhlenberg. The Mules’ lone wins came in their playoff seasons of 2001 and 2009.</p>
<p align="left">Muhlenberg is 2-6 all-time against York (6-23). The teams last met in 2009.</p>

<p align="left">The Mules (4-2, 3-2) are playing CC home games in back-to-back weeks for the first time ever, and following last week&#8217;s dramatic win against previously undefeated Gettysburg, they will try to avoid a letdown against an improving Juniata (1-5, 0-5) squad.</p>
<p align="left">Muhlenberg is 7-0 all-time against Juniata and has not allowed an offensive touchdown to the Eagles since they joined the CC in 2007.</p>

<p align="left"><strong>Field Hockey vs. Gettysburg (6:00)</strong></p>
<p align="left">Gettysburg and Muhlenberg are two of the eight teams still mathematically alive for the four remaining CC playoff berths. (First-place Franklin &amp; Marshall has clinched.) Gettysburg (10-3, 5-2), Washington and Haverford have two losses apiece, and then there are four teams with four losses, including Muhlenberg (9-5, 4-4).</p>
<p align="left">The Mules have four shutouts in their last seven games, including one Wednesday against Swarthmore (a team to which the Bullets lost), and have allowed more than one goal in a half just twice this season. They are second in the CC in goals-against average (1.27).</p>
<p align="left">Gettysburg has won four straight meetings to extend its series lead to 16-6. Last year, the Mules came back from a 2-0 deficit to tie the game, but the Bullets scored a disputed goal with 6:22 remaining for a 3-2 win.</p>

<p align="left">The final contest of the day features a Muhlenberg team that is in a dogfight for a playoff berth. With three games left to play, the Mules (9-4, 3-3) are currently tied for the fifth and final spot with Franklin &amp; Marshall and Washington.</p>
<p align="left">After beginning its CC season with a loss to Ursinus (the Bears’ lone CC win to date), Gettysburg (6-7-1, 1-4-1) has shown better of late, taking first-place Swarthmore to double overtime two weeks ago and snapping Haverford’s five-game winning streak with a 2-1 victory last Saturday.</p>
<p align="left">Muhlenberg holds a 34-18-6 series lead, including a 13-4-2 mark in CC contests. The Mules are undefeated (7-0-1) in their last eight meetings with the Bullets, a streak that began in the 2005 CC championship game.</p>

			<p><em>With the College on Fall Break, most of the Muhlenberg student body will be scattered around the Mid-Atlantic region and New England this weekend. So will Mule athletes.</em></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-104" title="Mule Marquee Matchup" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1-300x203.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="203" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1-300x203.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Men&#8217;s Soccer at Franklin &amp; Marshall (Saturday, 3:00)</strong></p>
<p>This is a critical matchup for two teams who were ranked 1-2 in the first regional poll of the season but now find themselves fifth and sixth in the Centennial Conference standings. F&amp;M (9-4, 2-3) is still tied for fifth in the regional rankings, while Muhlenberg (8-3, 3-2) is coming off a win against regionally ranked Drew.</p>
<p>Both teams lost 2-1 to Swarthmore and 1-0 to Haverford. The Diplomats also fell to Johns Hopkins, a team the Mules beat.</p>
<p>Expect a close game: Of F&amp;M&#8217;s 13 games, 10 were decided by one goal, and Muhlenberg has played five straight one-goal games, winning the last three.</p>
<p>F&amp;M leads the all-time series, 29-27-5, but the Mules are 4-0-1 in the last five meetings, including a 4-0 win in the 2010 CC semifinals.</p>

<p><strong>Football vs. Gettysburg (Saturday, 1:00)</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg returns from its bye week looking to snap a two-game losing streak. It won&#8217;t be easy against a potent Gettysburg squad that is 5-0 for the first time since 1987 and is outscoring opponents by an average of 35 points per game.</p>
<p>The Bullets are ranked in the top 15 in Division III in five statistical categories. They are third in rushing offense (326.8 ypg), fourth in scoring defense (8.2 ppg), 10th in scoring offense (43.2 ppg), 13th in total offense (489.2 ypg) and 14th in total defense (247.6 ypg). The Mules (3-2) are 11th in scoring defense (11.4 ppg) and net punting (37.1 yards per punt).</p>
<p>Gettysburg leads the all-time series, 43-32-1, but has not won in Allentown since 1996. The last time the teams played at Scotty Wood Stadium, Muhlenberg needed a last-second saving tackle on a fumble return to win in overtime, 33-27. </p>

<p><strong>Field Hockey at Franklin &amp; Marshall (Saturday, 12:00)</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg (8-4, 3-3) is one of eight teams with two or three losses in the congested Centennial Conference standings. All of them are chasing Franklin &amp; Marshall (11-1, 6-0), which is ranked fifth in Division III and has won 11 straight since dropping its opener to Elizabethtown.</p>
<p>The Diplomats come in with a streak of six straight shutouts and have allowed only seven goals all season. The only other CC team to allow fewer than 20 is Muhlenberg (15).</p>
<p>F&amp;M leads the all-time series, 13-6-1, and has won the last three. After 4-0 games in 2009 and 2010, last year&#8217;s meeting was closer, with the Diplomats leading 2-1 at halftime and going on to win 3-1.</p>

<p><strong>Women&#8217;s Soccer at Franklin &amp; Marshall (Saturday, 6:00)</strong></p>
<p>One aspect of this matchup would seem to favor the visiting team: Muhlenberg (6-6-1, 4-2) has shut out its last four CC opponents, while F&amp;M (2-4-4, 1-3-2) is the most offensively challenged team in the CC, with only six goals scored in 10 games.</p>
<p>The Mules enter the weekend in a four-way tie for first in the CC with 12 points, although Johns Hopkins and Gettysburg have played one fewer game. The Diplomats made the CC playoffs last season, and although they have struggled this year, they have not allowed more than two goals in a game, and they beat McDaniel, a team to which Muhlenberg lost.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg leads the all-time series, 16-4-1. F&amp;M won last year&#8217;s meeting, 1-0.</p>

<p><strong>Cross Country at Connecticut College Invitational (Saturday); at Lafayette Invitational (Saturday)</strong></p>
<p>The Mules will split up and run in two different meets. The top runners will head to Connecticut for a rare out-of-region meet. In fact, it&#8217;s the Mules&#8217; first meet not in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York or Maryland since they ran at Connecticut College in 1996. For the third straight week, the Muhlenberg women are ranked seventh in the Mideast Region.</p>
<p><strong>Volleyball at Kean Invitational (Friday-Saturday)</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg (12-7) takes a break from CC action and plays in its third and final tournament of the regular season. The Mules&#8217; opponents are Kean (16-6) and Alvernia (9-11) on Friday and Manhattanville (8-16) and NYU-Poly (6-19) on Saturday.</p>

			<p><em>Football is off this weekend, and so is cross country, but all the rest of the fall teams are home for a big weekend of Centennial Conference competition.</em></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-104" title="Mule Marquee Matchup" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1-300x203.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="203" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1-300x203.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Field Hockey vs. Washington College (Saturday, 1:00)</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg (7-3, 3-2), which has matched its combined win total from the last two years, has five CC games remaining &#8211; all but one against teams that qualified for the CC playoffs in 2010 and/or 2011. Washington (5-5, 2-2), the first of those opponents, made the playoffs both years.</p>
<p>Last year, the Shorewomen handed the Mules one of their worst losses, scoring four first-half goals en route to a 5-1 win. Washington leads the all-time series, 11-9.</p>

<p><strong>Volleyball vs. Washington College (Saturday, 12:00); vs. Cedar Crest (Saturday, 4:00)</strong></p>
<p>After falling to 1-3 in the CC with a loss at Dickinson last weekend, Muhlenberg (10-6) rebounded to sweep Bryn Mawr on Wednesday. This is a critical match for the Mules if they are to make a run at the CC playoffs, as their next three league matches are against 2011 playoff qualifiers. Washington (7-10, 2-2) owns a win against one of them, Gettysburg.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg has won 17 of 19 all-time meetings with the Shorewomen, losing only in 1994 and 2010. The Mules are 20-4 all-time against Cedar Crest (8-9), although the two Allentown schools haven&#8217;t faced each other since 2001.</p>

<p><strong>Women&#8217;s Soccer vs. Washington College (Saturday, 4:00)</strong></p>
<p>Just two weeks ago, Muhlenberg was on the verge of being virtually out of the playoff picture, with an 0-2 CC record and games against nationally ranked Johns Hopkins and regionally ranked Dickinson looimng. But the Mules (5-6-1, 3-2) won both of those games and are right in the thick of things &#8211; and their next two games are against teams below them in the standings, including Washington (4-5, 1-3).</p>
<p>Muhlenberg is a perfect 14-0 against the Shorewomen and has outscored them 46-3. Washington&#8217;s last goal against the Mules came in 2003.</p>

<p><strong>Men&#8217;s Soccer vs. Washington College (Saturday, 7:00)</strong></p>
<p>In a span of 44 hours last week, Muhlenberg went from sole possession of first place in the CC to the middle of the pack. Coming off Wednesday&#8217;s non-conference win at TCNJ, the Mules (6-3, 2-2) will try to re-establish themselves as one of the teams to beat in the CC. Washington is 3-5 overall, 2-2 in the CC.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg holds a commanding 22-1-2 series lead, with Washington&#8217;s lone win coming in 2008. Since then, the Mules have posted three straight shutout wins against the Shoremen.</p>
