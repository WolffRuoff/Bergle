								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">           This infographic discusses the statistics regarding how many people use the internet and how they use it. Most people don&#8217;t want to read an article that just lists a bunch of facts. Therefore by using numbers, percentages and different graphs, the author, Keshan, creates an engaging and colorful presentation of these facts and figures. Despite the overall idea of the article, that the internet is involved in every aspect of our life, there were some statistics that begged to differ. This infographic showed that online shopping only amounts to 5.8% of total shopping. (Keshen, 2014) This statistic shows that the internet cannot account for many things that a shopper needs. I know in my personal life, I am not a fan of online shopping as the items look different in person and you can&#8217;t try items on beforehand. I know I have kept many items I  have bought online because it isn&#8217;t worth the hassle or money to return them. While the internet is great for things like googling a question or watching a youtube video to help you in calculus, I think it has decreased human contact. Instead of meeting up to chat, many people can just text. It is important that we still have things like shopping that creates an experience for us to spend time with other people. But as technology develops, the problems with online shopping will become less and less. Will society get to a point of no human contact? </span><br />
