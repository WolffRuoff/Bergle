								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The amount of people that are gaining access to the internet and smart technology is increasing every day. According to a recent study conducted in seven different European countries (Belgium, Denmark, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Romania and the United Kingdom), many more children aged 9-16 are obtaining these technologies (Mascheroni &amp; Ólafsson, 2016). There has been less attention to this issue than issues such as inequalities in technology (Mascheroni &amp; Ólafsson, 2016).  According to another study “People who have more Internet access points are more likely to possess higher levels of online skill and have more opportunities to explore a wide range of mobile phone features” (Mascheroni &amp; Ólafsson, 2016). The usage patterns suggest that those better connected had a better chance to climb the ladder of opportunities which would make them better candidates for jobs (Mascheroni &amp; Ólafsson, 2016). When the data for each country was compared to the others, the variations were linked to the different levels of adoption and use of smartphones in each country (Mascheroni &amp; Ólafsson, 2016). This was tested to show that the increase in children with smartphones directly impacted the ability to get jobs. They compared gender, age, smartphone ownership and daily use, child’s experience with the internet and parental ownership and use of a mobile device so that all variables were accounted for (Mascheroni &amp; Ólafsson, 2016). The results indicated that kids were more likely to own a cellphone in certain countries and those who do had a higher likelihood of using it for the internet (Mascheroni &amp; Ólafsson, 2016). Another result found was that those of higher socioeconomic status were “69% less likely to use social media” (Mascheroni &amp; Ólafsson, 2016). This is odd because in America, it’s usually the opposite with wealthy people using more social media than those with less wealth.</p>
