The book examines the scholarly study of media audiences from a number of different perspectives: as objects of media influence, as creations of media institutions, as media users, and as fans and digital cultural producers. The book grew out of Dr. Sullivan&#8217;s many years of teaching Audience Analysis (COM 314), and his students in that course used the book for several years in draft form. The book was also beautifully illustrated with charts and figures by Media and Communication alum Stephanie Plumeri (&#8217;12).</p>
