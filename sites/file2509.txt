					<description><![CDATA[Interesting articles here about Pandora and Sirius XM satellite radio, and your overview of them is good.  What&#039;s missing here is some analysis of what these articles mean in the larger scheme of your industry - this is where the notion of power roles can help you to understand revenue models and strategic decisions of companies like Siruis XM and Pandora.  So, in future blog posts, I think you can go a bit shorter on your overview of the article(s) and much longer on the power roles analysis of what these articles reveal about power in your industry.  Please let me know if you have questions!]]></description>
