								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There wasn’t a time in High School that I wasn’t using an IPad or even a computer, I was always attached to some kind of screen I never really was able to get a break. Every homework assignment that I had, had to be done on my IPad and sometimes a computer. I would sit in class looking at a smart board and then writing down the notes on my IPad. By the time I was done with school and my homework I didn’t even want to look at my my phone or TV because I couldn’t stand looking at screens.</p>
<p>When looking at different books on IPads the one that really struck me was “Routledge Research in Early Childhood Education: IPads in the Early Years: Developing Literacy and creativity.” By Dezuanni, Dooley and Gattenhof. The whole concept of the book had to do with children developing with IPads and how they can use them for learning at a young age. Chapter seven focused on Preschools letting parents take home IPads for there children to use for learning. They would have to bring them back but they first teach the parents all about them and how to use them. Then they tell them what their children would be using them for.</p>
<p>This does sound like a nice way to have kids learn in a fun way but children shouldn’t be looking at screens at such a young age. Kids should be learning in a normal class room setting with paper and white boards and we should be teaching kids how to write in cursive not learning how to use a IPad. Even though its something that I only happening at home and not for a long time kids shouldn’t be learning IPads or any kind of small device until there older.</p>
<p>Kids should be playing with toys and going outside not looking at screens they need to build their imagination. They wont fully be able to do that when looking at a device, and playing video games.</p>
<p>The teachers didn’t really see much of a difference from the kids who did use IPads at home verse the kids who didn’t use IPads. The one thing that they did notice is that when the teacher pulled the IPads out for a class activity the kids who used them at home knew how to use and the kids who don’t use it at home had a little bit of a hard time.</p>
<p>My old school is a Pre-K – Twelve school so when we started using IPads in the high school they decided that the middle school and lower school should use them. They haven’t suggested that the little kids use them yet. I would find it absolutely crazy is they made Pre-K and Kindergarten kids use IPads for learning. Kids need to just play with each other and learn to socialize.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have we really reached a world that we might have to start using social Media to enhance our learning? Technology has already changed the way kids are learning so I couldn’t imagine kids using social media to learn. Using social media to learn would be very hard to do because kids most likely do not even focus on the work they would be reading up on their news feeds and talking to friends, but in the same senses I feel that kids would absorb information if it was laid out in social media. If your class was set up as a twitter feed I’m sure many kids would have such an easy time navigating through the work. It would be very interesting to see someone try to set a class up like that, or even if it was set up as Facebook.</p>
<p>But social media can be used in many other different ways for learning. Like in the article “Twitter for teaching: Can social media be used to enhance the process of learning?” Chris Evans does research to see if Twitter helps enhances the process of learning, but he uses students who have never used twitter before. It is interesting to see students who haven’t used twitter before become introduced to it in an educational way.</p>
<p>Evans has the students interact with their tutor over twitter using hashtags so that it is easy for the tutors to be able to go and look at what each student is asking. Evans asks in his research if this replaces kids being able to go to class, which he showed that it doesn’t cause even though the students question or concern might be answered, it can never replace the act of walking in to a class and sitting down for a lecture. Social media can never replace the act of going in to a classroom and having a face to face interaction with a teacher or professor.</p>
<p>Evans studied many different aspects of twitter and educations and he figured out that yes it did help students get more evolved and engage in what they were learning. But you will never be able to replace the classroom, social media will be able to help enhance learning. But I don’t think it will ever replace it.</p>
<p>This is something that as my generation gets older should start paying attention to because there might be a day where our kids don’t even go and sit in a class room. They will be learning everything online. They might not even know what a text book is because they will most likely be caring around a tablet or some technological devices that holds all their information that they need.</p>
<p>Our parents telling us how they remember a day without all this technology, we will be saying to our kids how we remember the days of text books and sitting in classrooms. At some point though I think someone will need to step in and make sure that the idea of sitting in a class room remains that way. Because we don’t want future generations not learning how to socialize in person and not getting those learning experiences that we get.</p>
<p>The movement of technology needs to start slowing down and we need to start looking at how much time we spend already looking at a screen. Its unhealthy and the last thing I would want is to be taking classes all online and using social media to help.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I first googled the IPad, Wiki didn’t even come up as the first website, apple and news articles about the IPad came up. After scrolling down a little and I clicked on the Wiki article I figured that the information about the IPad would be true because who would write false information. But at the same time I was surprised at how much information Wiki has about the IPad.</p>
<p>In high school and even middle school everyone was always told that Wiki was never a reliable source. At first I hated that because Wiki had all this information in one place and back before computers, people use to use Encyclopedias for everything that they needed to look up. It makes you wonder why the online one couldn’t be as reliable, but then who would have wanted to sit down and type up the entire encyclopedia. The information on the IPad though seems pretty much correct. At first when I read the first paragraph about when the IPad first came out, I thought it was wrong. It says April 3, 2010 which doesn’t seem that long ago at all. Even though it was five years ago I feel like I’ve been using tablets my whole life.</p>
<p>My high school required that I have an IPad, everything was on it from our text book, homework, notes, assignments and schedules. It was all done online so for someone who used an IPad all the time it is hard to think that at one point in time that I wasn’t relying on one everyday.</p>
<p>But Steve Jobs had an idea and he stuck with it. According to Wiki, he said in 1983 “strategy is really simple. What we want to do is we want to put an incredibly great computer in a book that you can carry around with you and learn how to use in 20 minutes &#8230; and we really want to do it with a radio link in it so you don’t have to hook up to anything and you’re in communication with all of these larger databases and other computers.” (Steve Jobs, second paragraph) This was before the IPad even came out and became a thing, but one interesting thing that I learned was on the side of Wiki there’s a picture and it says “Apple’s first tablet from 1993” I was too young to remember this coming out but it looks really interesting and cool. It came with a pen and it was more of a smaller tablet that fit in your hand. Apple made other devices like it but decided not to sell it because they didn’t want to hurt message pad sales.</p>
<p>It was really interesting to go on Wiki though and read through an article like this, considering I never use Wiki. It is nice to have a place that all the information about one thing is in one place. But Wiki no longer really comes up as a first website like it use to. The internet has just noticed that I’ve never gone to it or it puts the more popular websites up first. Hopefully one-day Wiki will turn in to a reliable source or there will be another website that will replace Wiki and be so much better.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bullying has always been an issue but with technology and social media being so essential to our lives its become easy for people to bully other people online. With every social media its easy to bully someone. It is not hard to make a fake account or just message a person or even comment on peoples post. It makes it even easier due to the fact that you don’t even see the person’s reaction. But now you are on social media that is specifically for posting pictures, and you might think how could you bully someone over Instagram.</p>
<p>When I first got an Instagram I put my self on private just because I did not want random people following but I would have never thought about someone bullying on Instagram. Way too many people can see what you comment. It is not like Facebook where you might not stop and look at everyone’s post and comment. But for Instagram you purposely go on it to look at the pictures and what their captions are and you usually read the comments.  So why would any one want to even do anything mean on Instagram or any social media, it will always be brought back up. I’ve never seen any one being bullied on Instagram but I have heard of it happening.</p>
<p>When I found Cyberbullying Research Center’s blog post on Instagram and bullying I couldn’t believe all the ways you could bully someone on Instagram. They listed five different ways to bully someone and then told some people’s stories. I don’t understand why anyone would want to bully anyone but since it does happen, the big question is what do we do?</p>
<p>I see so many different adds and campaigns to stop bullying but it still seems to be going on. I truly do believe that more people need to start standing up to bullies, if you see someone getting bullied over social media then say something once one person does it I’m sure more will follow. To the person who gets bullied you might have made it better for them to see someone standing up for them. In the blog post a twelve-year-old girl posted a picture and got mean comments on it for no reason, but then that also starts the conversation of a twelve-year-old girl shouldn’t be on Instagram. At some point there should be an age limit on how old you can be to be on any social media. Someone that young shouldn’t experience hate like that. Even as a thirteen-year-old they shouldn’t have to be dealing with social media like that. Yes, it happens at any age but an 18-year-old might be able to handle a situation a little bit better then a twelve or thirteen-year-old. Cyber Bulling is a major issue in our world today and we all need to take steps to help prevent it because one day our own kids will have to be dealing with this. So trying to make social media a better place will help the future kids.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Reading and writing are essential to everyday living. If you knew that just sitting down and reading a book would help with over coming things like stress or decreasing your chances of having Alzheimer’s disease, would you do it then? According to scientists, reading helps strengthen your brain and increase the blood flow which is beneficial. But if you’re able to sit down and read something that you are interested in then why not just read? If you are stressed out, read. Getting older or contracting Alzheimer’s disease could be helped just by picking up a book or reading the news paper. Its not proven that it will cure those things, but if it helps why no try it. Many people say they don&#8217;t have the time to read or they just don&#8217;t like to read, but why not just try it for twenty minuets; it is a way to escape the world for a little bit and learn new things. Hanski seems to think that reading is what shapes us. He also thinks it helps us with understanding our feelings, figuring out who we are and opening us up to all new things.</p>
<p>School is something that we all do not get excited about, but our teachers give us massive reading assessments that is helping us in the long run; however, the readings they give us are usually the cause of our stress. So maybe taking a step back from that reading assignment and clearing are minds and then getting back to it will help. No matter what, we have to read it but it makes a difference what attitude that you have towards the reading. If it is something you don&#8217;t want to do, then you are not going to be interested and get stressed out but if you look at it in a positive way then it might not be as bad. We go to school so that we can get a good education and get a good job to live a happy life well, to do all that we need to know how to read and write. So when looking at homework or a book that we don&#8217;t want to read, we are helping our brains out and making them stronger so that we can live out the lives that we all think about living.</p>
<p>Hanski wrote about one issue in his article and that was if you can’t read you are not going to fit in to a social environment. Everyone needs to read; You might not be the best reader out there but you still need to be able to read so you can complete everyday tasks. But reading could easily help you be successful in life. Mostly any job you get you will need to be able to read and write. Reading and writing is not only important for a job but also in who you become. “It helps us understand all feelings and events, it makes us better, it teaches us to respect people, it broadens our minds, and it opens out hearts to everything new.” (Mike Hanski, page 3) Hanski’s article makes you realize that reading is truly important and essential to our life. Without reading and writing we all might not be the bright people that we are today.</p>
