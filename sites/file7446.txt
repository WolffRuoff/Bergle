								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While I sat and listened to Jim Groom talk for a total of an hour and 15 minutes, I learned more about the internet and social media sites than I have ever thought I could. So many interesting topics and facts were discussed that it really makes me want to dig deeper on my own to try to understand a little bit better about the web as a whole and how everything works. One very interesting topic we talked about was how the internet and social media sites view us, the user. Most people would answer this as we are humans, easy, but that is not exactly the case. Everything we do on the internet is tracked and stored, the things we posed are used and we are practically working for free. To sites like Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and Twitter, we are merely the product. People use these sites to see what we, as in each other, post, tweet and etc. These sites are using what we do and selling it to people. Come to twitter and see what all your friends are posting, re tweeting and be apart of it all, as you can see, we are what they are selling and we should realize that we are working for free. If you are not happy with being a product, how does being a point of data feel. That is right, many social media sites see us humans as points of data, they collect all the things you do and charting them to see what people are doing, using and what they want. They do not stop and ask you before they do this, they just figure as Jim Broom talked about, the free part of the sites is having no privacy. Once they chart your data they will move to another and keep tallying up their statistics to see what is good for the social media site as a whole. It is said to say, however you are no longer human, you are a product or a point of data.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I found Jim Grooms presentation incredibly eye opening. I had no idea that the government had that much access to our personal information. At first I did not think it was a big deal that they had our information. The reason I thought this was because for safety reasons if I have to give up a certain amount of privacyÂ  it is okay. However when I saw the pizza phone call that is when I completely changed my mind. I found it completely invasive and dangerous that this is the direction we are headed with all of our personal information. Jim Grooms also said how the internet also views you as a series of data points. This means that they do not even care about you as an individual and view you more as a statistic. Following up on this topic advertising companies do the same thing. While you might think you are getting a free social media account they are actually selling all of your information to advertising companies. The assumption is that everything is completely free however you sacrifice your privacy. You are basically exchanging your privacy for free accounts.</p>
<p>Like I mentioned in my previous paragraph I never understood the problem with having people view my information. Now I understand the problem that this could potentially have on us in the future. I would have never have guessed that big social media accounts made their money by selling our information to advertising companies. I find this a complete invasion of privacy. Especially so because some social media accounts give the appearance of your profile being private. For example my status on Instagram is private. I thought this would give me control over who views my information. However, I now know that my information is being sold to advertising companies.</p>
