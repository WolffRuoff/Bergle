								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A selfie,“A self portrait photograph, typically taken with a digital camera or a camera phone held by the hand or supported by a selfie stick” (Selfie, 2015). All people, whether they want to admit it or not, have taken a selfie at one point in their life. It may have been for their followers on Instagram, or maybe to their best friend on Snapchat. Regardless of the recipient or the purpose, the selfie was still taken.</p>
<p>The world may think the selfie was introduced only a few years ago, but in reality the concept is ancient. The first selfie was technically taken in 1839 by famous photographer, Robert Cornelius. He used the first photographic process, known as daguerreotypy. This process however was much different from the selfie today. The photographer figured out that the process was so slow that he could start the camera, enter the frame, and then exit the frame (Selfie, 2015). Essentially, he was able to take a self portrait by himself. As time went on, the selfie continued to evolve. “The debut of the portable Kodak brownie box camera in 1900 led to photographic self portrait  becoming a more widespread technique” (Selfie, 2015). The photographer would position themselves in front of a mirror to capture their self portrait.</p>
<p>The selfie that we have grown to know started off as the typical Myspace picture. &#8220;An amateurish, flash-blinded self-portrait, often taken in front of a bathroom mirror” (Selfie, 2015). However these mirror pictures didn’t last forever. Once Facebook began overshadowing Myspace, the concept had morphed once again. User’s selfies were becoming more classy and well planned out. Digital cameras and camera phones were now obsolete due to the new technologies that housed front facing cameras.</p>
<p>Selfies were taken to a whole new level. They started out as just a profile picture on a social media site and evolved into a daily act for a lot of people. Well planned selfies are taken to get on likes on Instagram, ugly selfies are taken to send to friends on Snapchat, and group selfies are taken to capture memories. In just a few short years, the idea of the selfie we knew exploded. “The popularity of selfies in social media has been astounding. Instagram has over 53 million photos tagged with the hashtag #selfie. The word ‘selfie’ was mentioned in Facebook status updates over 368,000 times during a one-week period in October 2013. During the same period on Twitter, the hashtag #selfie was used in more than 150,000 tweets” (Selfie, 2015).</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The advent of the computer has undoubtedly led to the emergence of three major operating systems. Aforementioned operating systems include Windows, Mac, and Linux. According to StatCounter (Wikipedia, 2015), Windows is the most widely used operating system by families worldwide. Windows is unique in that it contains Microsoft Office, “an office suite of applications, servers and services” (Wikipedia, 2015). Microsoft Office’s applications include the well-known Word, PowerPoint, and Excel programs as well as the Access, Outlook, OneNote, Publisher, and Project programs (Wikipedia, 2015). These programs provide students and professionals with a multitude of features that can be utilized to complete tasks in a timely and efficient matter. But, what are the specific features of these programs that make them so vital to academic and professional success? To answer this question, a further analysis of the three programs that Microsoft included in its original 1988 Office bundle—Word, PowerPoint, and Excel—must be conducted (Wikipedia, 2015).</p>
<p>Since its release in 1983, Microsoft Word has often been “considered the main program in [Microsoft] Office” (Wikipedia, 2015). Word is “a word processor” that was originally developed “for the MS-DOS operating system and had the distinction of introducing the mouse to a broad population” (Wikipedia, 2015). Though a mouse was not required for the program to operate, “Word 1.0 could be purchased with a bundled mouse” by those that desired one (Wikipedia, 2015). Word has played such an integral part in Office due to its sustained popularity. This popularity is due, largely in part, to its ever-expanding role in the lives of students and professionals. Students and professionals make daily use of Word when looking to complete tasks such as essays, letters, and reports.  Word’s user-friendly display offers a plethora of options for individuals to design, format, and review projects that they are working on. With Word, a user has the opportunity to pick from stunning fonts such as Broadway and Georgia, elect the margin size for a paper, and review the paper using the popular feature Word Count. Hence, Word’s seemingly endless possibilities make it a go-to for students and professionals looking to produce exceptional projects.</p>
<p>Another favorite among students and professionals is Office’s PowerPoint program. PowerPoint is a “presentation program” that enables users to “create slideshows, composed of text, graphics, and other objects, which can be displayed on-screen and shown by the presenter or printed out on transparencies or slides” (Wikipedia, 2015).  Visual presentations are crucial. Said presentations allow audiences to fully grasp the concept that the presenter is exhibiting during a presentation. Visual presentations are made simple by PowerPoint which lets users choose from many of the same gorgeous fonts on Word, set the presentation’s background to their choosing, and implement transitions. It is no wonder why so many people turn to PowerPoint. Whether its students giving a class presentation, educators teaching a new topic to their students, or business executives introducing a product to their clients, people rely on PowerPoint as a resource to convey the message(s) they are attempting to get across.</p>
<p>The final member of Microsoft’s “big three” from its original 1988 Office bundle is Microsoft Excel. “Microsoft Excel is a spreadsheet program” that was introduced for Windows on a “run-time environment in November [of] 1987” (Wikipedia, 2015). Like its close friends Word and PowerPoint, Excel is an ideal program for students and professionals. Excel is the perfect tool for projects that involve numbers. Excel provides users with cells, organized by column letter and row number. These cells will take the values a user opts to input into the program and then apply the values to a user-selected formula from Excel’s extensive formula list. Therefore, Excel is the perfect program for individuals looking to run a series of calculations. Students taking advanced business, mathematics, or science courses and people that work in analytics and other related fields praise Excel for its incredible features.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Microsoft Office is the perfect tool for students and professionals. Office’s trifecta of Word, PowerPoint, and Excel in addition to its Access, Outlook, Publisher, OneNote and Project programs provide individuals with an array of features that can be utilized to complete tasks effectively. Since its release in 1988, Microsoft Office has built a reputation for itself as a consistently reliable set of applications. As a result, people turn to Office and will continue to do so as they look to produce high-caliber projects.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I first googled the IPad, Wiki didn’t even come up as the first website, apple and news articles about the IPad came up. After scrolling down a little and I clicked on the Wiki article I figured that the information about the IPad would be true because who would write false information. But at the same time I was surprised at how much information Wiki has about the IPad.</p>
<p>In high school and even middle school everyone was always told that Wiki was never a reliable source. At first I hated that because Wiki had all this information in one place and back before computers, people use to use Encyclopedias for everything that they needed to look up. It makes you wonder why the online one couldn’t be as reliable, but then who would have wanted to sit down and type up the entire encyclopedia. The information on the IPad though seems pretty much correct. At first when I read the first paragraph about when the IPad first came out, I thought it was wrong. It says April 3, 2010 which doesn’t seem that long ago at all. Even though it was five years ago I feel like I’ve been using tablets my whole life.</p>
<p>My high school required that I have an IPad, everything was on it from our text book, homework, notes, assignments and schedules. It was all done online so for someone who used an IPad all the time it is hard to think that at one point in time that I wasn’t relying on one everyday.</p>
<p>But Steve Jobs had an idea and he stuck with it. According to Wiki, he said in 1983 “strategy is really simple. What we want to do is we want to put an incredibly great computer in a book that you can carry around with you and learn how to use in 20 minutes &#8230; and we really want to do it with a radio link in it so you don’t have to hook up to anything and you’re in communication with all of these larger databases and other computers.” (Steve Jobs, second paragraph) This was before the IPad even came out and became a thing, but one interesting thing that I learned was on the side of Wiki there’s a picture and it says “Apple’s first tablet from 1993” I was too young to remember this coming out but it looks really interesting and cool. It came with a pen and it was more of a smaller tablet that fit in your hand. Apple made other devices like it but decided not to sell it because they didn’t want to hurt message pad sales.</p>
<p>It was really interesting to go on Wiki though and read through an article like this, considering I never use Wiki. It is nice to have a place that all the information about one thing is in one place. But Wiki no longer really comes up as a first website like it use to. The internet has just noticed that I’ve never gone to it or it puts the more popular websites up first. Hopefully one-day Wiki will turn in to a reliable source or there will be another website that will replace Wiki and be so much better.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of Apple&#8217;s newest products, the Apple Watch, made its debut in the Spring of 2015. It is an incredible device, and it&#8217;s popularity has exploded because people love the thought of technology right at their fingertips.The watch &#8220;quickly became the best-selling wearable device with the shipment of 4.2 million smartwatches in the second quarter of 2015&#8221; (&#8220;Apple Watch,&#8221; 2015). Apple watch allows you to view text messages and e-mails right on your wrist, while allowing you to keep your iPhone in your pocket (&#8220;Apple Watch,&#8221; 2015). People like this because it comes off as more professional. For example, if an attendee is in the middle of a meeting, it typically isn&#8217;t appropriate for him or her to pull out a phone. However, if the attendee is just looking at their watch, chances are no one can tell the difference. Additionally, users can hold phone conversations and speak right into the watch to reply to messages. This is helpful because people like to be able to manage their time as efficiently as possible. Since the apple watch gives people such easy access to technology, it&#8217;s popularity is going to continue to reflect that.</p>
<p>Through the Fitness app on the watch, people can track their physical activity and send data back to their phone to keep for future records (&#8220;Apple Watch,&#8221; 2015).This feature of the watch is just another of many reasons that people are so drawn to this technology. People no longer have to carry additional equipment with them, aside from their phone and watch, to track their physical activity throughout their day. This is also a huge convenience piece, and people are majorly in favor of it. Interestingly enough even with this convenience factor in mind that draw people to purchase the watch, there have been some negative reviews. &#8220;Many reviewers described the watch as functional and convenient, while also noting failure to offer as much potential functionality as preceding smartphones&#8221; (&#8220;Apple Watch,&#8221; 2015). However, even with mixed reviews, people are still going to be interested in purchasing the watch to explore it for themselves, and still consider it a convenient tool that they can have easy access to.</p>
<p>The Apple Watch comes in different collections, sizes, and colors, providing buyers with lots of choice (&#8220;Apple Watch,&#8221; 2015). Today&#8217;s generation goes crazy at the thought of a thinner, sleeker, piece of technology because of it&#8217;s convenience factor. Apple Watch, along with many other new technologies have proven that people are willing to pay a hefty price just so that they can have the latest and greatest. People want to be able to access technology while putting forth the least amount of effort possible.</p>
<p>In conclusion, Apple Watch is a great example of a new technology that has attracted the attention of millions simply because of its look, its usefulness, and its incredibly small size. Apple watch does it all, and it is going to continue to be a huge success as more versions come out in the future.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Facebook is a social media website used by over 500 million different people. It connects the world and brings people closer together but pushes people further apart at the same time.</p>
<p>Do you ever get jealous of that kid with that really cool house? Or that girl who has it all, nice clothes, shoes and jewelry? Imagine that jealousy and multiply it by thirty. Doesn’t feel too good does it? Kids on Facebook today are envious and some very unhappy due to the exposure of positive, yet misrepresented highlights from their peers. The reason I say multiply your jealousy by thirty is because online the jealousy is everywhere, there’s no getting around it, there’s no way out. Three hundred and forty eight. That is the average number of friends each Facebook user has. That is three hundred and forty eight people who display on Facebook only the positive aspects of their lives while keeping the negative out of reach of the internet and hidden within themselves. The distorted view Facebook users’ get of their friends has them logging off at night doubting themselves and not appreciating everything in their lives. This creates a sort of envy firing up in the stomachs of Facebooks many users. And while this type of envy not only has Facebook users drooling over what others have that they don’t have, it has profound effects on other aspects of life as well. The dangers of Facebook may even come from within the users themselves as the article states, “Facebook can lead to severe depression, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-hatred">self-loathing</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rage_(emotion)">rage</a> and hatred, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resentment">resentment</a>, feelings of inferiority and insecurity, pessimism, suicidal tendencies and desires, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_isolation">social isolation</a>, and other issues that can prove very serious” (Wikipedia, 2015). The problems quoted above are all very real. Depression, personal resentment, insecurities and suicidal tendencies are no joke. For the social networking site that supposedly better connects the world it certainly connects these mental health issues first hand to its users. Facebook needs to take immediate action with regards to fixing its web of endless jealousy. What appears to be a harmless photo of somebody’s vacation to the Bahamas or the new car a friend got for their birthday can turn into much worse. These photos mislead Facebook users into thinking negatively about themselves, harming their physical and mental state of being.  It has been generated from studies over the conflict of Facebook envy that at least 1 and 3 users leave the site feeling less satisfied with their lives (Wikipedia, 2015).  Facebook needs to act and act fast on this issue, because if Facebook wishes to expand even further, that entails bringing Facebook envy to the next level. And I strongly believe young Facebook users have been through enough already.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the ever evolving world today, teens have become so accustomed to the presence and use of technology in their day to day lives. With the existence of technology, comes the ever-growing want and need of two top priorities: to be connected to friends, family, and strangers around the world and to have one’s privacy remain intact while doing so. In July 2011, the wants and needs of the aforementioned teens came true via the release of Snapchat. The app was created by Evan Spiegel, Bobby Murphy, and Reggie Brown as a requirement for a course at Stanford University (“Snapchat,” 2015).  The app’s platform encourages users to send candid pictures of whatever it is that they are doing in that moment. The unsaved photos are then sent to user’s friends and are deleted after a maximum of ten seconds which is set by the sender. Although this form of social media sounds utopic, are teens relying so heavily on the assumption that the pictures are deleted forever that they let their guard down? The answer is yes.</p>
<p>An increased sense of privacy is typically accompanied by an increased sense of indestructibility. Within the four years that Snapchat has been up and running, sexting has become overwhelmingly popular because users believe that once the content disappears after the time limit expires, it is gone forever (“Snapchat,” 2015). Contrary to popular belief, Snapchat’s main privacy page states that “there may be ways to access messages while still in temporary storage on recipients’ devices or, forensically, even after they are deleted (“Privacy Policy,” 2014).” Therefore, users of Snapchat are being deceived by themselves. By not knowing the full parameters of the app, one is acting in ways that they would not if they did not believe the app was private. The fact that this not-really-private-privacy is not hidden but rather in regular sized text on the main webpage of Snapchat, shows that teens are not looking carefully at what they are agreeing to when signing up for an account. Consequently, I believe that teens today allow themselves to get into the trouble that they are getting in because they are too quick to believe what they want to be true.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>SoundCloud has become an underground music source for people around the world. It was established in Sweden by Swedish music artists as a collaborative tool. However, SoundCloud eventually developed into a mechanism of self promotion and distribution catered towards bands and vocalists. One of the main attributes that makes SoundCloud attractive to so many people is that it’s completely free to use the website. Money is a significant problem among music artists. The lack of fiscal stress enables people to explore and pursue their music careers freely and from an international platform. In addition to the cost effective nature of SoundCloud, its initial release in 2011 was simultaneous with the popularity of tablets and mobile browsing. Wikipedia states that in 2012, “the new SoundCloud version was released to the general public…The enhanced platform offered new features such as: redesigned profiles; more sharing options; real-time notifications…” (Wikipedia, 2015), etc. These enhanced visualizations and connectivity between SoundCloud’s users made the website and app initially less appealing to the public, but statistically gained higher ratings than ever before.</p>
<p>One of the most significant contributions to SoundCloud as a global company was the partnership with Twitter in 2013. Many people had doubts about the credibility of SoundCloud when, “talks with major music labels about licensing…did not amount to anything substantial”, for the, “negotiation process was initiated in an attempt to avoid the problems faced by Google” (Wikipedia, 2015) about copyrighted material. However, with Twitter’s newfound stake in the company, SoundCloud started to appear to the social media community as a company to be taken seriously. Through ads, royalty agreements, and participation between various music labels, artists, and specifically Warner Music, SoundCloud has been able to handle the conflict of copyright and has officially dominated the music scene throughout the world.</p>
<p>As a young vocalist, SoundCloud makes pursuing a career in music more easily attainable. It allows artists to have complete control over their work and easily spread it around the world. Its combined use of sharing throughout various social media sites, such as Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr, and Google Plus, makes self promotion and self-acclaimed fame possible and imaginable. It’s the American Dream want to start a business from scratch and make a fortune from it. This social media tool makes it possible for artists to do just that, and to do it themselves about something they’re passionate about.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you have a twitter account or are involved in any type of social media, you have probably seen a “hashtag” before. We know hashtags most popularly as simple ways for people to search for tweets that have a common theme or topic. “Hashtags can be used to collect public opinion on events and ideas at the local, corporate, or world level” (&#8220;Hashtag&#8221;, 2015). For example, if you wanted to see people’s opinions of Donald Trump, you could simply search #DonaldTrump in the twitter search bar and get an entire feed of tweets pertaining to him. Hashtags are used for a variety of reasons and if promoted by enough people, can even “trend” and therefore attract more people to the topic at hand.</p>
<p>While many people may believe the “hashtag” originated on Twitter, it is actually not a Twitter function. Also known as the “number sign,” hashtags were first used in information technology to highlight a specific meaning. For example, “In 1978, Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie used # in the C programming language for special keywords that had to be processed first by the C preprocessor” (&#8220;Hashtag&#8221;, 2015). Later on, IRC networks began to use number signs to label channels or topics. A man named Chris Messina was inspired by the IRC and proposed a similar system to be used on Twitter, tweeting, “how do you feel about using # (pound) for groups. As in #barcamp?” (&#8220;Hashtag&#8221;, 2015) on August 23, 2007. This proposal became extremely popular and continued to grow as Twitter began to hyperlink all hashtags and eventually introduce “Trending Topics” on its front page. Hashtags are now used on a variety of different platforms, including Instagram, YouTube, Google, and even on television.</p>
<p>Businesses and advocacy organizations have especially taken advantage of the “hashtag” by connecting the popularity of social media with the promotion of their products, services, or campaigns. For example, “There is a collaboration between the social networking site Twitter and American Express that makes it possible to buy discounted goods online by tweeting a special hashtag. American Express members can sync their card with Twitter and use the offers by tweeting and look for a response in a tweet with the confirmation from American Express” (&#8220;Hashtag&#8221;, 2015). Not only can hashtags positively affect a business’ market, but they can also be used with a negative connotation, where they are better known as “bashtags.” Nowadays, it is extremely common for people to use social media platforms in order to complain about poor customer service or to criticize a company. Hashtags have the power of drawing attention to important issues and controversial topics.</p>
<p>Overall, people have found a countless amount of ways to use hashtags for their own benefit; whether to spark a conversation, start a trend, gain more followers, or to promote a specific event or campaign. For better or for worse, hashtags have become extremely powerful tools not only in social media, but in our everyday lives.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In 2010, co-founders Travis Kalanick and Garrett Camp released an app that would change transportation forever. With technology growing at a rapid rate as well as apps and social media starting to become increasingly important in everyday life, Uber was created as an easier, quicker, and cheaper way to transport. Starting in only big cities such as New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago, Uber proved to be the mode of transportation that each city was lacking. In New York, the iconic yellow taxi ruled the streets but with such a high demand all the time, finding an unoccupied cab was easier said than done. In a matter of seconds Uber lets each user set their location, destination, gives a fare estimate, and labels what time the cab will arrive at your given destination. Uber gives smartphone users the ability to connect with their driver in the easiest and cheapest way possible. The best part about Uber is not having to directly pay the driver for their services. All payments are linked through a credit or debit card account that charges the passenger once their ride is over. The creation of Uber has changed the way people travel from place to place. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With Uber’s massive success in the United States throughout limited cities, the company decided to expand globally. As of 2015, Uber has launched in 60 cities worldwide including countries all over Asia, Africa, and Europe. Traveling through a foreign country can be extremely difficult in terms of navigation but Uber has given people the ability to not have to be able to communicate in an unfamiliar language in order to get from place to place. With the ability to use your current location and set a destination where you would like to go, Uber has eliminated helplessly looking for historics sites, a restaurant, or any other specific location. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Uber is not just available in big cities but has also branched out to rural and suburb areas. In a small town, rarely does anyone ever see a taxi just driving around looking for a customer and not every small town has a taxi service willing to pick someone up and drive that passenger long distances. Uber has given people in less populated areas the ability to get from place to place at the with just a few taps on their smartphones. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The requirements for becoming an Uber driver include being able to pass a background check as well as having a license and car. Once these tasks are passed, you are free to be an Uber driver. This proves to be one of the reasons along with cheaper prices why Uber is currently taking over cities around the world. In a place like London, it takes up to four years to become a taxi driver. Each candidate must drive around the city on a motorcycle learning all the streets from a book that they are given by the taxi service. In New York, each candidate must attend a training course to become a yellow cab driver. Uber does not require any of these steps which makes people more inclined to become an Uber driver rather than a Taxi company. With Uber’s growing presence in places all over the world, taxi drivers have become more and more irritated by Uber drivers taking their business. Just this summer in Paris, violent protests broke out between Uber drivers and Taxi company drivers. The protests definitely indicate a shift from taxi companies to Uber controlling the roads. With Uber working everyday to improve their services, it&#8217;s only a matter of time before they eliminate taxi companies forever and continue changing the way we travel. </span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="mceItemHidden">Technology and smart devices are coming to new places in a variety of forms. Moving forward, technology is increasingly becoming a part of our daily lives. More than we even know it. But what does this mean for our generation? The goal is simple. To better the lives of many, keep everyone connected and make lives hassle free. But the transformation is easier said than done. Education is among one of the biggest undergoing changes. Current students have more ways than ever to explore new ideas and solve problems. And the growth is not coming to an end any time soon.</span></p>
<p><span class="mceItemHidden">The world is moving at a rapid pace and it’s directly led by recent technological innovations. Some of the most significant improvements are those taking place inside the classroom. Most say Technology’s integration with education enhances a student’s learning experience. However, <span class="hiddenSpellError">unrelatedly</span>, many see it as overwhelming, more time-consuming and difficult to make the change. However, this can’t be agreed to by everyone. New programs are allowing students to complete assignments entirely on their wireless devices without the need to pick up a pencil. Many find this very intriguing. New sharing options let students send off their assignments to teachers with ease. In addition, technology helps students stay in contact over weekends and school breaks.</span></p>
<p><span class="mceItemHidden">Another major strength of technology in the classroom is research, which has become easier than ever. The wide range of sources available right at one’s fingertips <span class="hiddenSuggestion">provide</span> students with speed and accuracy. Many agree, however, there is also a large <span class="hiddenSuggestion">selection</span> of garbage and irrelevant inaccurate information and people need <span class="hiddenGrammarError">to be</span> aware of. Throughout the encyclopedia article, the idea that mobile learning is controversial repeatedly comes up. But why? While technology in the classroom may seem useful to the <span class="hiddenSuggestion">majority</span>, many see it as distracting. Others say it’s even more time-consuming than standard learning and can cause stress due to common system errors making productivity a challenge. Additionally, many see it as unreliable and <span class="hiddenGrammarError">an invasion of</span> privacy. Being a student myself, it’s sometimes hard to disagree. According to (&#8220;Technology integration,&#8221; 2015), another concern <span class="hiddenGrammarError">is cost</span>. With all that one gets with access to a mobile device, it can become costly when having to <span class="hiddenSuggestion">provide</span> devices for a whole class. It’s believed by many that technology for the classroom is a work in progress that’s constantly growing and expanding.</span></p>
<p><span class="mceItemHidden">One key benefit of technology’s integration in the classroom is interactive learning. According to (&#8220;Technology integration,&#8221; 2015), the thought process and conceptual experience makes for an easier learning process. But why? By learning from one’s mistakes, students can make changes, review and perfect assignments and thus learn by doing. So what? This method has been proven <span class="hiddenGrammarError">to be</span> one of the best ways for the brain to absorb information.</span></p>
<p><span class="mceItemHidden">Being able to work on projects simultaneously with one another submit to the teacher for review all though a handheld device is something people in the past have only dreamed about. This relates to the class reading on how technology has evolved over time. According to (&#8220;Technology integration,&#8221; 2015), a project-based activity can enhance one’s ability to work in groups and solve more complex problems that one couldn’t normally complete on their own. In addition, interactive learning can also be fun and enjoyable. So What? This keeps the mind flowing and ultimately keeps students focused for longer periods at a time. This <span class="hiddenGrammarError">can be</span> very noticeable. As a result of recent technological advancements, it’s clear that collaboration plays a major role in the learning process. </span></p>
<p><span class="mceItemHidden">Technology in the classroom has come a long way. With <span class="hiddenGrammarError">the addition of</span> new programs and services, the methods to learning have changed drastically. Despite high costs, privacy issues, distractions, and often less reliability, technology in the classroom is becoming increasingly common throughout school districts around the globe. In relation to class discussions, many agree that technology is always growing and the only thing that stands in the way of adoption is time and effort. <span class="hiddenSpellError">Infographics</span> in recent class assignments have shown us the numbers <span class="hiddenSuggestion">pertaining to</span> the increasing adoption of digital media. Major brands are hard at work attempting to bring the latest and greatest to everyone so that lives <span class="hiddenGrammarError">will</span> be made easier and education <span class="hiddenGrammarError">can be</span> improved for all. </span></p>
