								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most people in today’s society know what cyber bullying and bullying are. Students have probably had assembly after assembly on why not to cyber bully and how it makes the person being bullied feel. However what really drew me to this article was that it was not simply a run down of why not to bully. It told the differences and similarities between the two. I thought that this was fascinating because this was information that had never really been explained to me before. I also believe that in order to try and stop something like bullying or cyberbullying you need to fully understand the two topics.</p>
<p>The biggest reason for bullying is because there is an imbalance of power. In other words bullying to me is making someone else feel small in order to make oneself feel better. This is why bullies select their victims very carefully in both cyber bullying and in normal bullying. “Both tend to target passive victims in which balance of power favors the bully”( Gale, 2016).  The character traits of the bully are also the same. “ Both involve harassment of a victim by an aggressor whose intent is to inflict harm” ( Gale, 2016). The main similarities between cyber bullying and bullying is the type of people that are bullied and the ones who bully. I found this incredibly interesting.</p>
<p>Some of the difference between bullying and cyber bullying I found quite unsettling. For example in cyber bullying people are not always sure of who their bully is. “This anonymity empowers many cyber bullies to continue antagonizing their victims” ( Gale, 2016). With bullying normal schoolyard bullying people can pinpoint exactly who is targeting them. With cyber bullying it could literally be anyone  and this is a hard pill to swallow. i cannot even imagine not even knowing who is causing trying to hurt them. This also makes the bully feel that they can’t get caught and make the threats more prevalent. With technology as well there is always access to the person. They can make threats twenty four seven. Cyber bullying is so much more dangerous than normal bullying for this reason. People get a sense of confidence behind the computer screen that is unwavering. They say things that they never would to a persons face.</p>
<p>Having now known the difference and similarities between bullying I feel i understand the topic of cyber bullying a lot more. I understand that it is not the people who are changing it is simply their access to the people being bullied that are changing. Cyberbullying is considered to be more detrimental as well. In my previous statement i concluded that it was not the people who were changing it was simply the method. If this is so its raises the question should we think of technology as more detrimental for young kids then beneficial?</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The concept of google as a whole has always been fascinating to me. You can have access to all of the information in the world at any time. However through this activity i began to realize the differences in the type of information one would search for. For example , as an active member on social media, it would be safe to assume that I could find myself on google. Also as an athlete I thought there might be some information on me. When I actually googled myself there was thousands of pictures of different Rosie Martins.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When I put more specific information into the search category I noticed that more information came up. For example Rosie Martin Ramapo basketball had more information about me personally. This brings me into my first category of information which is more personal information.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>With personal information unless you are famous there will be little to no information about your personal life unless you are very specific. This means that anyone who googles me will basically have no concept of who I am. Just out of curiosity I decided to google something completely random that probably not many people really would google. I picked Arbor day. Thousands upon thousands of articles came up about arbor day. However when I typed in a specific foundation on arbor day less information came up. To summarize what I learned through googling myself is that with personal information it is better to google specific topics. In general information it is better to keep the searches general to obtain more articles. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> One thing that I also noticed was that the more successful a person was meant the more information they have about themselves on google. In my free write I wrote about how in order to be successful I wanted to have a great job and a happy life. In actuality I think the true measure of success to have done something great enough for people to be able to google it. I also think that having this google identity will immediately change people’s perceptions or first impressions of you. For example I said before how if you googled me nothing would come up. Now when people google me they would be able to find something great and this would mean that I would have done something to<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>become successful.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">         The first chapter of It’s Complicated explains the difficulty of trying to create a persona on social media because everyone perceives things differently. This chapter discusses an example where a girl was tagged in a photo holding a beer on Facebook. Although she did not post the photo, friends were notified that she was tagged in it. To most people this picture creates a poor image of the girl ;however, it is just a photo and viewers are not clear of the context. She may have been holding the drink for a friend, but not enough information is given to understand what is happening. In chapter 1 boyd (2014) states, “ Without a shared sense of context, hanging out online becomes burdensome. “ (p. 36) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">            People are very quick to judge online and there is not much room for explanation. There is no way to know how a post can be perceived by everyone and therefore there is no way to insure that it is perceived correctly. One quick tweet or post on instagram and the rumor mills have started. One person screenshots the post and declares her opinion about the post and it is then spread like wildfire. People thrive on gossip and they read too much into posts that were supposed to be fun and lighthearted. This is the black hole of society. Everybody assumes without thinking. Everyone judges without questioning. These mistakes that we all make are much harder to make in person as you simply ask a question as the conversation flows.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">            There is no conversation on social media, only little bits and pieces that have no context or room for question and answer. How do we fix this? Boyd repetitively mentioned how social media is a challenge; a challenge to our identity and a challenge to our peers. Is this a challenge we should try to overcome or  should we take after </span><span style="font-weight: 400"> Brian O’Neill,  in the article </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Teens Who Say No To Social Media,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> who chose to talk in person with his friends and avoid social media all together.
