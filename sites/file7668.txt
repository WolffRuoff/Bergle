								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The best way for me to see how far we have progressed with technology is to talk with my grandparents. They had no technology and have completely different values than I do. If a kid in the 50’s was given an iPhone it would have no meaning to them. They would even probably prefer a toy dinosaur or soldier. Give a person in the 2000’s an iPhone and they probably would have thought it was the greatest invention ever. Give a kid today an iPhone and they probably would give it back because they already have one. In 2000 technology was new and if you were a kid with an iPhone you were considered to be cool and outside the norm. Now if a kid has an iPhone it is considered the norm. I grew up in between the  generations of fascination and having technology be the norm. I think the idea of being stuck in between two generations is  best represented by the time i got a phone. I had gotten my first flip phone in third grade. The only problem was no one else in the school had a phone. This meant i could only call home or my Mom or Dads cell phone. Now every third grader has an iPhone. I always find this fascinating because to me I value having an iPhone because I once had a flip phone. Third graders don’t value the iPhone because to them it is their norm. I believe this is why technology keeps advancing. In todays society when something becomes normal it’s old.</p>
<p>Growing up with technology has not been all iPhone and flip phones however. I think in some ways technology has actually had a negative effect. For example in text messages i don’t normally use proper grammar or spelling. Sometimes I catch myself making the same spelling and grammar mistakes in my essays as I did in my text messages. In previous generation they did not make the same mistakes because they valued pen and paper over technology. Texting and emailing has also weakened my writing skills overall. It has made me become a lot more informal when addressing people as well. I  also believe that I may have missed out on an important part of socialization because i was glued to my phone. The article Teens who say no to Social Media by Christen Rosen describes the effects on young kids who say no to social media.&#8221;The kids recalibrate much quicker than adults. They find a tribe, then fun or trouble in trees and creeks. . . . They are way more active by default,” (Rosen 2016).</p>
<p>Technology does have its benefits too. My Mom was an actress on broadway when I was too young to see her perform. However, it is always fun to watch the videotapes of her performances. Without the ability of technology to record her shows I would have never seen my Mom take the stage. I also get to see videos of my Dad playing sports in high school. I think it is interesting that despite the time difference technology allows us to document the past. My family also would have never had family movie nights without technology. These are memories that I will have for the rest of my life thanks to technology. Technology has changed my life by allowing me to live a completely different lifestyle than previous generations. It has also allowed me to look back at the history of those generations.</p>
