The new <strong>Browse the Shelf<\/strong> feature in Encompass Search can be very helpful in locating other sources related to your search.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/lh4.googleusercontent.com\/xTgiBx0g8QPgWRp7h22BNtPPaMyfGbp85XRusXWwwRJF2zC09jGTOIphzuNGQYzd_i_hbQJBvtAW62hGULTK1MUjO8sXabu7vnluYoIaWXw6g25pFeV4X-RE8QrgJUJJP6496kmi\" alt=\"\" width=\"604\" height=\"582\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>When looking at the full record in Encompass Search for an item on the shelf, you may have noticed a new drop-down feature called <strong>Browse the Shelf<\/strong>.\u00a0 It\u2019s located between <strong>View Description<\/strong> (where you can get more details about the item (including contents, synopses and subject headings) and <strong>Explore Editions and Formats<\/strong> (where you can see if there\u2019s a later&#8211;or earlier&#8211; edition, or if the item is available in a different format). <br><br><br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Open <strong>Browse the Shelf<\/strong> and you are presented with a virtual representation of a shelf&#8211; i.e. the book in context, lined up on the shelf next to other resources it would sit next to.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh4.googleusercontent.com\/8Bq7OH05T7X_5D7HV42BXfkRyrTfRsTIHcBXPTExNLFFt1bC4DGVanzcQ3xgzbFjXwkg9SNI1VzPHrEGu-Fqlnvjhg95NxEip6Nx-xzYfhVcM9NRPcLqnfsq7d3pdFvZCMf7ouMe\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p> That\u2019s not the end of the story, however.\u00a0 This feature was designed for libraries that may have items in multiple locations.\u00a0 It will also show items that <em>could <\/em>be located next to or near an item, even if they are not actually located there. For example, if there is a DVD in the Audiovisual Collection or a book in the Rare Books Collection within the same call number range as a book in the Main Collection, <strong>Browse the Shelf<\/strong> will include these other items&#8211;in call number order.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong><em>There are several things that you should know about <\/em> Browse the Shelf<\/strong> <strong><em>in order to <\/em><\/strong><em>better<\/em><strong><em> understand the results and use it to its full extent. <\/em><\/strong><em>\u00a0<\/em><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>First, let&#8217;s talk about <strong>call number order.<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p> The whole Browse the shelf &nbsp;tool works by comparing call numbers regardless of any other data like format or location. It puts all items with a similar call number in one list&#8211;as if they were going to sit on the shelf next to one another. This means that you might find documentary videos (located in our Audiovisual Collection on level A) interfiled with books on the same subject in the main stacks, along with books from our Juvenile Collection or Ready Reference Collection (located on level C and A respectively).&nbsp; This is a great feature if you want to find other types of materials on the same topic across the collections.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, below we see a score for the musical \u201cAnything goes\u201d listed next to a Music CD for the same title, even though these are in different shelving locations of the library.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/QcpX9ofXBMdJ7_oAHB3voC8etrtFTdEdhvlOTHCZ5_vPW5f6BgM1iC3x8uMuuMK8kHqezV--zkeFw7WULq1KYvCQErhsdhPwS4c69zlt0DinofMHuK1RZwanfm94kSr5g9oTVa_k\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p> Note: There is currently no ability to \u201crefine\u201d or \u201cfilter\u201d items in the shelf browse by shelving location or collection, but this feature is scheduled by our service provider, OCLC, for a future enhancement. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Second, eBooks do not have call numbers.<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Browse the Shelf<\/strong> will not show all of the eBooks we hold interfiled with the physical books.&nbsp; This is because, unlike physical books, eBooks do not have call numbers assigned to them. <strong>Browse the Shelf <\/strong>will only show an eBook if we also own a physical edition of the book too.&nbsp;&nbsp; It&#8217;s worth remembering that there are many, many eBooks in our collection that  will not be shown in <strong>Browse the Shelf<\/strong> .  The functionality to show all eBooks interfiled with physical items has been requested, but it is unclear how this could work in practice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p> Shown below is a book by a Muhlenberg Faculty author that we also hold as an eBook. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh6.googleusercontent.com\/QoAXlZuoFh86udSkQjB43U6BdBmufQrR1nzOi5eM-zWVvet8Tv69s4ck4-bPPqB33xymVqAzXPeC27jeEd9VDIzuI_9kBJIFTgQHttYYeF4fgcSnOsPRhyG1CoK0ey3Vs9haE3bY\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Third, if Trexler Library holds two copies of a particular item, each shelved in a different location, only one copy shows in Browse the Shelf.\u00a0<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright\"><img data-attachment-id=\"2619\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/trexlerworks.muhlenberg.edu\/trexler_blog\/featured-resources\/infomaniac-3-browse-a-bookshelf-from-your-desktop\/attachment\/image-2-3\/#main\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/trexlerworks.muhlenberg.edu\/trexler_blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/image-2.png?fit=451%2C489\" data-orig-size=\"451,489\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"image-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/trexlerworks.muhlenberg.edu\/trexler_blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/image-2.png?fit=277%2C300\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/trexlerworks.muhlenberg.edu\/trexler_blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/image-2.png?fit=451%2C489\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"451\" height=\"489\" src=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/trexlerworks.muhlenberg.edu\/trexler_blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/image-2.png?resize=451%2C489\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2619\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/trexlerworks.muhlenberg.edu\/trexler_blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/image-2.png?w=451 451w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/trexlerworks.muhlenberg.edu\/trexler_blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/image-2.png?resize=277%2C300 277w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 451px) 100vw, 451px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>If we have, for example,  one copy in Special Collections and one copy in the Main Collection, <strong>Browse the Shelf<\/strong> uses the call number from the first copy listed in the record.
