								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On the topic of conduct issues, childhood-onset conduct disorders tend to have the more severe consequences, in comparison to adolescence-onset, later in life as the problems such as drug abuse, destruction, and aggression continue through adolescence and adulthood. We talked briefly in class about the gender differences in identification of childhood-onset conduct disorders. The ratio of boys to girls identified is 3:1 and it is known that, “The majority of research on antisocial behavior in youth has focused on the samples of boys, (Frick &amp; Viding, 2009)” because antisocial behaviors, such as aggression, are rarer in girls. I think this topic is interesting as aggression in girls is not the same as aggression in boys, as girls show it in a way that impacts their relationships and relationships of their peers.</p>
<p>I decided to focus on this point to raise the question of whether girls are actually less aggressive, or if their relational aggression (Frick &amp; Viding, 2009) goes unnoticed or unidentified because their aggression is viewed as them being a “mean girl” among their peers. The “mean girl” is seen as normal in society as they are often portrayed in movies and TV shows. Girls may begin to show this relational aggression more in adolescence but if it is continuous, it should not go unattended to as, “… Adolescent girls who largely showed adolescent onset to their antisocial behavior also showed high levels of CU (Callous- unemotional) traits, problems with impulse control, and a number of other social and temperamental vulnerabilities that were more similar to childhood-onset boys than to adolescent-onset boys. Frick &amp; Viding, 2009)”</p>
<p>It is important that when relational aggression behaviors are noticed in girls that they do not be taken lightly, especially if they are continuous. Girls are not “just being girls” sometimes and their actions that may just seem immature and part of normal development can actually be a deeper conduct issue that can have negative consequences for them later in life.</p>
