					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;In this article Hanski truly does lay out the way to becoming a successful writer and I believe that his message is so powerful because of the way it is all structured.  Like you listed in your post, he names so many benefits that writing has other than just getting good grades in your English class; he mentions ways that reading can help you physically, mentally, and emotionally. By doing this the audience is able to really connect with the piece and understand the huge impacts that reading can have on a person&#039;s life.&lt;/p&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Reading and communicating with others are the only ways to learn. And I&#039;m not just talking about improving writing. Life skills and &quot;what do you want to be when you grow up&quot; are even more important. I think you made a good point that it&#039;s going to help in ways we don&#039;t even realize so it can&#039;t hurt to read.&lt;/p&gt;
