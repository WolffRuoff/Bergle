			<p>It seems as if Fall Ball for Muhlenberg women’s lacrosse has flown by faster than ever! Over four weeks we practiced hard preparing for our scrimmage that would conclude our Fall Ball season. Several practices, an alumni scrimmage and one competitive scrimmage is all we would have to look back on until February 1.</p>
<p>Starting on Day One, we picked up our sticks, eager to get on the field. The only talk heard throughout Scotty Wood Stadium was lacrosse chatter. Everyone was focused and ready to go.</p>
<p>This fall was different than past Fall Ball seasons with only eight returning upperclassmen. We had more sophomores on the team than juniors and seniors combined! We also welcomed five freshmen to the women’s lacrosse program.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/11/wlax_fallball14.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2503" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/11/wlax_fallball14.jpg" alt="team huddle" width="500" height="284" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/11/wlax_fallball14.jpg 500w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/11/wlax_fallball14-300x170.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>Coming together was a challenge but with hard work, constructive criticism and team bonding we were able to come together as one. The late-night practices were tough and <a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/11/wlax_pictureday14.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2507" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/11/wlax_pictureday14.jpg" alt="picture day" width="200" height="207" /></a>tiring but we picked each other up with positive attitudes and encouragement. Every ball caught, every goal scored, every check and every ground ball picked up was preparing us for the spring season.</p>
<p>Along with our five new freshmen teammates we welcomed our new assistant coach, Liz Beville. She is a recent graduate from SUNY Cortland. We were very excited to have Liz on board! So far she has brought effective new drills to practice and has great strategies when it comes to defense and offense. Her knowledge on offensive plays and defensive strategies has given the team new outlooks and a better understanding of the game. We are excited to have her continue to coach us when Spring season arrives.</p>
<p>On Saturday, October 11, we welcomed back the Muhlenberg lacrosse alumnae. We played them in a competitive, up-tempo scrimmage. The opportunity to play with our former teammates was very fun and enjoyable for everyone involved!  It was also great to meet players that played for the program several years ago. We were all able to share stories of our playing days at Muhlenberg.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/11/wlax_alum14.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2502" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/11/wlax_alum14.jpg" alt="women's lax with alums" width="500" height="244" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/11/wlax_alum14.jpg 500w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/11/wlax_alum14-300x146.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>A tailgate was held after the scrimmage, where the men’s and women’s programs came together to celebrate the event. Overall, it was a great day for the Muhlenberg lacrosse programs.</p>
<p>Our program has a long history of participating in community service. We like to give back off the field. Each year we donate money to participate in a 5K race. This year we decided to take part in the 22<sup>nd</sup> annual Women’s 5K Classic in Allentown. We ran the race in our red Muhlenberg Lacrosse t-shirts and received many compliments and thank yous.</p>

<p>Our team was also able to donate an additional $125 which was raised from selling pink ribbons to the Muhlenberg students and faculty. All of the money raised for this event is used to fund breast cancer research in the Lehigh Valley. This all-female race brought in over 500 women and it was an honor to be a part of something so big. As much as the team loves playing lacrosse, giving back to the community to help others in need is extremely important to us.</p>

This was a big deal for us as a team because we had worked so hard for the past four weeks to reach this point. We knew this scrimmage would also be a challenge due to the fact that we were missing four members of our team, two abroad and two participating in field hockey. After the nerves disappeared at the beginning of the game, we started playing together and good things started to happen. At the end of the game we took the time to reflect on what our strengths and weaknesses were and what we needed to improve on individually in the next few months.</p>
<p>This Fall Ball season showed us a glimpse of what we are capable of and we are excited for what the future holds. Our team is anxious to come back in February ready to start the 2015 lacrosse season for Muhlenberg women’s lacrosse!</p>

			<div>The Mule men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s lacrosse teams enjoyed their annual alumni scrimmages on Saturday, October 11th, 2014 with a large crowd of alumni and parents on hand.  Leading the men&#8217;s alumni team were Brad Lutzer &#8217;05, Galen Marsh &#8217;06, Luke Silverman &#8217;08, Will Garrity &#8217;10, Nick Rispoli &#8217;12, Charlie Pianko &#8217;12, Ted Albanese &#8217;13, Michael Carpetto &#8217;13, Ian de Ruiter &#8217;13, Jack Reilly &#8217;13, Doug Rheiner &#8217;13, Ian Jones &#8217;13, Dan Thomas &#8217;14, Tom Glancy &#8217;14 and Casey Gill &#8217;14.</div>
<div></div>
<div><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/10/mlaxalumni14.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2455" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/10/mlaxalumni14.jpg" alt="mlaxalumni14" width="600" height="207" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/10/mlaxalumni14.jpg 600w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/10/mlaxalumni14-300x103.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/10/mlaxalumni14-500x172.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a> The game was competitive and physical with bodies and sticks flying all over the field.  The varsity led the contest from start to finish but the game remained close throughout.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The alumni squad enjoyed great success at the faceoff X with Nick Rispoli &#8217;12 and Ian Jones &#8217;13. Michael Carpetto &#8217;13 and Doug Rheiner &#8217;13 each had two goals and Jack Reilly &#8217;13 and Ian de Ruiter &#8217;13 contributed the other goals for the alumni team.</div>

<div>The varsity team was led offensively by senior Jon Thomas. He was healthy after missing almost all of the 2014 season and had two goals. Senior attackman Conner Burdick had two goals and sophomore attackman Brad D&#8217;Alessandro also had two goals. Senior attackman John Hetzel, also back from missing almost all of the 2014 season, had a goal along with freshman attackman Tim Brennan.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The final score was 8-6 in favor of the varsity. The tailgate was full of good food, and the Mules are very excited and energized about the 2015 season. They will conclude their fall season with their annual scrimmage against DeSales on Saturday, October 25th, at 4:30.</div>

			<p>At 6a.m. on a clear, hot summer-like day, the Muhlenberg College men’s lacrosse team was on the bus headed to New York City to run the Stephen Siller Tunnel to Towers 5K. For those of us who participated in the run two years ago, we didn’t think twice about having to get up early. The younger guys who hadn’t ran in the past fed off our energy when they saw how excited the upperclassmen were to head back.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/10/sillerlogo.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2427" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/10/sillerlogo.jpg" alt="Stephen Siller Tunnel to Towers" width="300" height="247" /></a>Stephen Siller, a FDNY firefighter out of Park Slope, Brooklyn, from Rockville Centre, New York, lost his life on September 11<sup>th</sup>.  Siller worked the night shift and was heading home that morning when he heard the news of the first tower being hit. He called his wife and turned back. When he found the Battery Tunnel was closed, he grabbed his gear, ditched his truck, ran through the tunnel to the towers and never made it out.</p>
<p>The 5K carries on the legacy and sacrifice of Stephen Siller and all the others who were lost. This was the 13<sup>th</sup> annual 5K, and the Stephen Siller Foundation has grown tremendously and holds similar 5Ks throughout the country. The Stephen Siller Foundation builds smart homes that are powered by iPads for wounded veterans.</p>
<p>It took about 30 minutes to register and eventually make our way over to the block-long crowd to behind the starting line. The race starts at NYFD Squad 1, Siller’s firehouse, and retraces his final steps. Following the national anthem at about 10a.m., the Mules and 30,000 other runners headed off in their respective waves.</p>
<p>Firefighters from around the world ran came to run in their gear to pay tribute while military units ran together in their workout fatigues. About 15 minutes after the start we jogged past the news crews, high-fived Governor Cuomo and started off towards the tunnel toll free.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/10/mlax_tunnels1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2421" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/10/mlax_tunnels1.jpg" alt="Tunnel to Towers run" width="500" height="162" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/10/mlax_tunnels1.jpg 500w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/10/mlax_tunnels1-300x97.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>“U-S-A!” chants broke out in the muggy tunnel as music played through speakers. Memories of 9/11 distracted us from the miles left to go. We weaved through the packed tunnel sticking together in groups. Light emerged at the end of the tunnel to the first breath of the new World Trade Center buildings, now completed unlike two years ago.</p>
<p>Over a thousand West Point cadets lined the streets bearing American flags, while firefighters dressed in formal blues held banners of the faces of each one lost that tragic day. I ran harder, acknowledging each face, nodding to those who carried them.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/10/mlax_tunnels5.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2426" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/10/mlax_tunnels5.jpg" alt="Tunnel to Towers run" width="500" height="269" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/10/mlax_tunnels5.jpg 500w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/10/mlax_tunnels5-300x161.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>We ran along the Hudson River through Battery Park with a view of the Statue of Liberty shining in the distance. Local cheerleading squads and marching bands cheered us on along the way. We made a final turn out of the park to the finish line at the base of the Freedom Tower. We all met back together and took a moment to look up and take it all in.</p>
<p>Before heading back to the bus we walked through the Ground Zero Memorial. The twin reflecting pools, an acre big each, sit on the foundation where the towers once stood. I got lost looking down into the biggest manmade waterfall in the country, thinking how that one day changed everything for all. I read the inscribed names on the bronze edging, listening to the water fall stories below. I never visited the monument before, so it really fulfilled this tribute even more so than the last time we ran in it.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/10/mlax_tunnels3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2423" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/10/mlax_tunnels3.jpg" alt="Tunnel to Towers run" width="500" height="317" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/10/mlax_tunnels3.jpg 500w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/10/mlax_tunnels3-300x190.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/10/mlax_tunnels3-473x300.jpg 473w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>We all ran with a sense of pride and ran for something bigger than us all. It was truly a humbling experience. As sophomore Brad D’Alessandro put it, “It was so inspiring to see firefighters running in their gear, others who crutched or completed the race in wheelchairs. It was just so American.”</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/10/mlax_tunnels4.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2424" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/10/mlax_tunnels4.jpg" alt="Tunnel to Towers run" width="240" height="526" /></a>A few of our parents ran with us, while others came and met us at the finish line. We spoke with a couple prospective students, who approached us asking questions about Muhlenberg College, and others acknowledged our effort in coming from Pennsylvania to run.</p>
<p>It was an honor to run with thousands of others to carry on the lives that were lost but never forgotten. There’s nothing like running through the Battery Tunnel, along the Hudson River in the shadow of the Freedom Tower on such hallowed ground on a beautiful Sunday morning in New York City. The guys look forward to doing it again next year.</p>

			<p><em>Earlier this month, the Muhlenberg women&#8217;s lacrosse team ran in charity 5K race. Senior Veronica Maccia filed the following report:</em></p>
<p>It was a great day for running. The sun was shining and there was a cool breeze to keep us company as we ran to support those not as fortunate as us.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/10/wlaxbig_MB103013.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2029" alt="women's lax 5K" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/10/wlaxbig_MB103013.jpg" width="780" height="444" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/10/wlaxbig_MB103013.jpg 780w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/10/wlaxbig_MB103013-300x170.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/10/wlaxbig_MB103013-500x284.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" /></a></p>
<p>Every year, as a team, we choose a cause to support that we find important. For the past two years, we have been running for the Turning Point of the Lehigh Valley because as a team, we know how crucial it is to have support from those around you, especially in times of need. The Turning Point is a place for victims of abuse to find refuge. Its mission is to eliminate domestic violence, increase awareness and empower victims. This organization helps over 5,000 victims of domestic violence each year.</p>
<p>Even though the cause of the race was enough to make us put forth all of our effort and run as fast as we could, it was also helpful that we were all in great shape since we had been working really hard and pushing ourselves during our fall-ball season. The scenic route was another plus as we ran the 3-mile race. Throughout the run, there were dogs running around, people fishing and spectators cheering us on.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/10/wlax5k_seniors.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2028" alt="women's lacrosse seniors" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/10/wlax5k_seniors.jpg" width="600" height="279" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/10/wlax5k_seniors.jpg 600w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/10/wlax5k_seniors-300x139.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/10/wlax5k_seniors-500x232.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><em>smiling seniors Kaitlyn McCaffrey, Ally Shaffer, Rachel Chinman, Kelsey Mital, Michelle Certosimo and Veronica Maccia</em></p>
<p>Of course, no day can go on without a hitch and the people who were in the front got a little lost and made a wrong turn. Thankfully, they realized it before it was too late.</p>
<p>As a team, doing things together really brings us closer and helps us create a bond that will help us be successful on the field. We are looking forward to future community services activities that we will be partaking in throughout the school year.</p>

			<p><em>Profiles of senior Muhlenberg athletes are published in game programs in the sports of field hockey, football, soccer, volleyball, basketball, wrestling, baseball, softball, lacrosse and tennis, usually on that sport’s Senior Day.</em></p>
<p><em>As part of the Year in Review, here are some of the best responses in the Q&amp;A profiles from the winter and spring athletes.</em></p>
<p><strong>Matt O’Hara, Men&#8217;s Basketball</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you could trade places with anyone for a day, who would it be? </strong>Truthfully, in a completely non-weird way, I’d love to be on the girls’ basketball team. They have the best team chemistry at this school and some of my best friends are on that team: Julie Kelly, Alita Zabrecky and Kate Clawson, plus the whole sophomore class. They are a great team with great girls who have a ton of fun together.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/05/lagomarsino_yir.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1777" title="Ryan Lagomarsino" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/05/lagomarsino_yir.jpg" alt="" width="256" height="350" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/05/lagomarsino_yir.jpg 256w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/05/lagomarsino_yir-219x300.jpg 219w" sizes="(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px" /></a>Ryan Lagomarsino, Men&#8217;s Basketball</strong></p>
<p><strong>What was it like student teaching this past fall semester? </strong>Student teaching and playing basketball was an enjoyable hell. I would wake up every morning at six and hang out with a bunch of little prepubescent eighth graders. It was great because they would actually get my jokes and appreciate me acting like an idiot for their entertainment. After I was done yelling at those little whirling dervishes, and maybe teaching them a thing or two about the Mayan Empire, I would drive back to school, shove food down my throat and then get yelled at during practice. In the midst of all of this chaos, I would somehow do homework and sleep (sometimes during practice&#8230;) and I eventually became a master of the chaos. The worst part about all of this running around was that I loved every second of my time being Mr. Lags.</p>
<p><strong>Alita Zabrecky, Women&#8217;s Basketball</strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s the most memorable game of your Muhlenberg career? </strong>My most memorable game was, by far, my freshman year at Gettysburg. For some reason Coach had both Kate Clawson and I on the floor late in the game, down by one, with just seconds to go. We had the ball on the sideline out of bounds and our play was designed to get either Kelly [McKeon] or Alex [Chili] the ball so they could shoot, but they were not able to get open so by default, they had to pass to me. I started dribbling toward the basket and the next thing I know I am dribbling the ball off of my foot, thankfully right in the direction of Kate who snatched it up off of the floor. Once Kate had secured the ball I figured my best bet was just to stay out of the way and run to the basket to grab a rebound if someone missed a shot. After almost turning the ball over, I figured I probably should not be taking the last shot of the game. Kate now throws the ball into Sheila Cook in the post, and as I am making my way to the basket, Sheila throws the ball to me, assuming I am making a cut and that I wanted the ball (which I did not). It bounced off my chest, and I caught it and laid it in for the game-winning bucket. This play was by far the most dysfunctional game-winning play I have ever been a part of. I am just thankful that I made the layup given my track record of missed layups.</p>

<p><strong>How did you get started playing lacrosse? </strong>I started playing lacrosse when I was 10 years old and in fourth grade. My career conveniently started when my baseball career ended (I didn&#8217;t make the travel team). It&#8217;s a funny story actually. The night I found out I didn&#8217;t make the baseball team, I also found out my pet hermit crab died, so that was a rough night.</p>

<p align="left"><strong>What was it like playing with your brother at Muhlenberg? </strong>Since I was born, my brother was always right there at my side &#8230; By the time I was a senior in high school, &#8230; the only one I had in mind was Muhlenberg so I could play with my brother. When spring of my freshman year finally came, it felt like Christmas came early. As the team hit the field for the first time, I just saw my brother and I walking out to the backyard to have a catch. When lined up to guard him in practice, he’ll say he got the best of my every time, but he doesn’t want to admit his little brother came in as a freshman and put him on an island day in and day out. It was one thing to practice together, but to play in the games with each other made it even more special. Hearing, &#8220;Carpetto brothers you’re next on defense&#8221; was something that gave me chills every game.</p>

<p><strong>Describe Coach DeStasio in one word. </strong>I would describe Coach DeStasio as a “non-hugger.” This year we divided our team into “huggers” and the “touch me and die” group, otherwise known as “non-huggers.” Having grown up with the president of the “huggers,” Angie Sisco, I am definitely part of the “non-hugging” group and it’s great to have a coach that shares my views on this matter.</p>

<p><strong>This is your second year as team captain. What has been the most rewarding part of leading the team for two years? </strong>The most rewarding part of being captain is being able to see all of my fellow teammates grow not only as tennis players, but as people – on and off the court. On the court especially, I have seen so many of my fellow teammates get more and more confident in their games and play some truly amazing tennis. Every one of them motivates me to be a better tennis player and even though I am captain, I think I look up to them for all that they do and their tennis skills. We spend so much time together during the season and I feel really lucky to have met such a smart, fun, loving group of girls … I am so honored to hold this position for my team.</p>

<p><strong>Do you have any pregame rituals or superstitions? </strong>My teammates will call me the most superstitious person on the team, and I’d have to agree. I’ve been wearing the same bow in my hair for game day throughout my four years here. I have two main rituals &#8211; one is taking a shower before every game. I started doing this my freshman year and when I started having success on the field, I knew I had to keep it. It’s a way of thinking about the game and what I want to accomplish. The second ritual also started my freshman year &#8211; a senior at the time (Alyssa Bascelli) told me about her pregame ritual of eating a pint of Ben &amp; Jerry’s ice cream the night before every game. She informed us that someone had to do it with her so that when she graduated, it would get passed down. I was the willing (and maybe not so intelligent) freshman who said, “Sure!” and proceeded to eat a pint of Ben &amp; Jerry’s Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough ice cream the night before every game. I have for all four years and now that I am graduating, I have passed the ritual down to freshmen Rachel Pedersen and Casey Armstrong. You guys better not disappoint me!</p>

<p><strong>Your middle name, Zoe, is pretty unique. Were you named after someone? </strong>I am named after my Greek grandmother (my Yiayia) whose name was Bessie Zoe Athanasiou. Zoe means “life” in Greek and was the perfect portrayal of my Yiayia who is sadly no longer with us. We also both had only one dimple on our left cheeks. This was something we shared and something she always loved about the two of us. I am honored to be named after my Yiayia, and her spirit lives on and will continue to live on through me as I share her name.  </p>

<p><strong>What’s it like having six siblings? Are you the youngest, oldest or in the middle? </strong>I am the third oldest of seven. My brother, Joey, is the oldest, then I have one older sister, Kelly, and four younger sisters, Erin, Mary Kate, Maggie and Tara. People generally feel sorry for my brother for being the only boy, but they shouldn’t because he is treated like a king (and acts like it). The biggest issue with having six siblings, and especially five sisters, is that you cannot leave any personal items unattended, especially clothing, because you will never get it back.</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Rechten, Baseball</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do you have any pregame rituals or superstitions? </strong>I have way too many superstitions and rituals to even name them all – from the way I put on my cleats to the made-up gibberish language our catcher Brett Rosen and I use to communicate before I pitch. The most meaningful and consistent ritual I have revolves around the word “trust.” The importance of this word was instilled in me by my high school coach. Before the inning begins he would tell me to clear off the mound and envision the word trust printed on the rubber. This year I printed it on the brim of my hat. It has served as my anchor, allowing me to take all the emotion out of the situation and focus on doing my job for our team.</p>

<p><strong>How is it being teammates with Ryan Rechten? </strong>As a player, Ryan is one of the more loose and goofy kids on the team – he always has something ridiculous to say. The best part about this is that it makes everyone around him relaxed and reminds us that baseball is just a game and that we must treat it that way if we want to be successful. What I commend him for is his ability to joke around and have fun in the bullpen for six innings of the game and then turn it on right around the sixth knowing that it is his job to come in late and shut the door against the opposing team. I couldn’t think of a better person to have in this role as I have all the confidence in the world that he will come in and get outs in a hurry.</p>
<p><strong>Rob Shannon, Baseball</strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s it like having nine older siblings? </strong>Having nine older siblings is the most incredible thing in my life. It is something that I truly treasure. I am so blessed to have them because they have truly made me into the person I am today. They mean more to me than words can capture. I wear the number nine to represent them.</p>
<p><strong>Robert Appleby, Baseball</strong></p>
<p><strong>How did you get started playing baseball and what’s your first memory of playing?</strong>I’m not really sure how I got started but when I did start playing at the age of 4, I was instantly obsessed. My first memory of actually playing baseball was my first year of tee ball. The league rules were that there were no outs and each team got to hit through the lineup every inning. I remember being at shortstop when this kid hit a line drive to me, which I caught and doubled off the runner at first base. Even though I made the play, he still got to stay on base. I remember how excited I was when I was old enough to play in the league where you could actually get people out. As a hitter now, I take back ever thinking that.</p>

<p>Softball and track and field take the spotlight this weekend.</p>
<p><strong>Softball at McDaniel (Saturday, 1:00)</strong></p>
<p>What makes this the marquee matchup of the weekend? It&#8217;s not just that McDaniel is in first place in the Centennial Conference with an 8-0 record <a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-104" title="Mule Marquee Matchup" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1-300x203.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="203" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1-300x203.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>and Muhlenberg is one of two teams tied for second at 6-2 &#8211; although that certainly is a big part of it.</p>
<p>The two teams have come by their success in extremely different manners. Muhlenberg is hitting .374 and averaging more than nine runs in its eight CC games. Reigning CC player of the week Kelly Kline is hitting .593 with a .963 slugging percentage in CC games .</p>
<p>McDaniel, on the other hand, has done it with pitching, allowing only eight runs in its eight CC games. Reigning CC pitcher of the week Caroline Brehm is 8-0 with a 0.46 ERA and 88 strikeouts in 45.1 innings in CC games.</p>
<p>What will win out, hitting or pitching?</p>

<p><strong>Track &amp; Field hosts Muhlenberg Invitational (Saturday, 10:00)</strong></p>
<p>The Mules welcome 15 other schools for their only home meet of the outdoor season. This meet has been contested in rain and snow in previous years, so the sunshine and mild temperatures should lead to some good performances. Muhlenberg is also sending a handful of runners to Princeton for a distance event Friday night.</p>
<p><strong>Women&#8217;s Lacrosse at McDaniel (Friday, 3:30); Men&#8217;s Lacrosse at McDaniel (Saturday, 1:00)</strong></p>
<p>The Mule lax teams travel to Westminster in search of their first Centennial Conference win of the season. Both teams defeated McDaniel last year, the women 17-6 and the men 8-5. Both Green Terror squads have won just once in the CC.</p>

<p><strong>Baseball at Franklin &amp; Marshall (Saturday, 12:30 doubleheader)</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg has lost four of its last five CC games and will look to get back on the winning track against a Franklin &amp; Marshall team that has split its first three CC series. Four of the Diplomats&#8217; first six CC games ended in shutouts, two each way.</p>

			<p>A pair of Muhlenberg men’s lacrosse players recently traded in their sticks and pads for pencils and sketchbooks.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/salaskoart21.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1018" title="salaskoart2" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/salaskoart21.jpg" alt="" width="396" height="396" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/salaskoart21.jpg 396w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/salaskoart21-150x150.jpg 150w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/salaskoart21-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 396px) 100vw, 396px" /></a>Seniors Jay Salasko and Alex Ardolino are taking the class Drawing from Nature this semester, and some of their work is currently on display in the Galleria Lobby at the Baker Center for the Arts.</p>
<p>The class encourages students to seek inspiration from the natural world, be it birds, fish or animals &#8211; or even their bones. For a recent project, they were given various skulls and skeletons from the science department replicate. Both Salasko and Ardolino took a shot at drawing a pig skull. Salasko also tried his hand at sketching pig foot bones.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/salaskoart.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1011" title="salaskoart" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/salaskoart.jpg" alt="" width="269" height="720" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/salaskoart.jpg 269w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/salaskoart-112x300.jpg 112w" sizes="(max-width: 269px) 100vw, 269px" /></a>And while the subjects may seem rather macabre, Salasko said they were interesting and that he enjoyed the challenge of trying to convey the depth and feel of the objects.</p>
<p>“There are a lot of curves and shadows that can be tough to draw, especially on the skull,” he said. “It was cool to hold the two next to each other when I was done.”</p>
<p>While neither of them consider themselves artists, they said they’ve always been interested in drawing and that it gives them a chance to be creative.</p>
<p>A psychology major, Salasko has been drawing and doodling since he was a kid. But he never had any formal training until he took Drawing I in the spring of his sophomore year. That experience piqued his interest, so he took Painting I this past summer. And when he needed credits this spring to fulfill his graduation requirements, he took a look at the available art classes.</p>
<p>Ardolino, who is majoring in business administration, got his work hanging on the gallery wall in much the same fashion. He took Drawing I this past fall, and enjoyed it so much that he decided to keep with it this semester. Of course it didn’t hurt that one of his teammates was also in the class.</p>
<p>Now that they’ve gotten their works on display, Salasko and Ardolino hope to draw a few more masterpieces on the field.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/ardolinoart.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1014" title="ardolinoart" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/ardolinoart.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="396" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/ardolinoart.jpg 400w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/ardolinoart-150x150.jpg 150w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/ardolinoart-300x297.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/ardolinoart-303x300.jpg 303w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></a>And when they’re sitting at their desks a few years from now working on a project or doing some research, they just might start to doodle. And pretty soon that doodle could turn into a sketch, which just might bring back some memories of their time taking Drawing from Nature</p>
<p>“It’s a fun class, and I’ve learned a lot,” Ardolino said. “I never thought I’d be taking many art classes, but I really enjoy it. And I definitely think I&#8217;ll keep drawing.”</p>

Hopefully, the forecasted rain will not turn this busy schedule into an April Fool.</p>
<p><strong>Softball vs. Washington (Saturday, 1:00); at Gettysburg (Sunday, 1:00)</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-104" title="Mule Marquee Matchup" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1-300x203.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="203" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1-300x203.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Two Centennial Conference playoff teams square off on Saturday in the Mules&#8217; first home CC doubleheader of the 2012 season. Muhlenberg beat Washington, 8-4, in the first game of the playoffs en route to the CC championship last year. The teams split in the regular season. The Shorewomen are off to a 4-0 start in CC play, while the Mules are 2-0.</p>

<p>Live stats Game 2: <a href="http://www.muhlenberg.edu">http://www.muhlenberg.edu/sports/softlive2/xlive.htm</a></p>
<p>Gettysburg did not make the CC playoffs last year but is traditionally one of the strongest teams in the league, and one that gives Muhlenberg a hard time. The Mules have never swept the Bullets in a regular-season doubleheader, and they haven&#8217;t won a game at Gettysburg since 2000.</p>

<p><strong>Baseball vs. Ursinus (Friday, 3:30); at McDaniel (Saturday, 12:30 doubleheader); at Centenary (Sunday, 12:00)</strong></p>
<p>The 16-6 Mules, who received 11 votes in this week&#8217;s D3baseball.com poll, look to continue their winning ways with three CC games and one non-league contest. Coming off Tuesday&#8217;s 11-5 win at Ursinus, Muhlenberg will try to complete its first season sweep of the Bears on Friday.</p>

<p>Saturday&#8217;s twinbill is against a McDaniel team that, like Muhlenberg, has shown great improvement: The Green Terror is 11-4 after winning 12 games all of last season. The Mules, who have scored in double figures in 13 of their 22 games, will try to solve a McDaniel pitching staff that has a sparkling 2.40 ERA.</p>

<p>After evening their CC mark at 2-2 with a dramatic win vs. Franklin &amp; Marshall last night, the Mule women look to make it two in a row against a Washington team that reached the CC championship match last year. The Mule men are looking for their first win of the spring.</p>
<p><strong>Men&#8217;s Golf at McDaniel Spring Invitational (Saturday and Sunday)</strong></p>

Enjoy!</p>
<p><strong>Men&#8217;s Lacrosse vs. Franklin &amp; Marshall (Saturday, 7:00)</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg will be collecting food items and donations for the Second Harvest Food Bank at this game. Most food shelters receive plenty of donations around the holiday season. It is right around spring time when their supplies run out, so this is a very important time to give.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-104" title="Mule Marquee Matchup" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1-300x203.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="203" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1-300x203.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Do not expect the spirit of giving to carry over to the lacrosse field. Centennial Conference games are usually closely contested, and these two teams have taken that to an extreme, going to double overtime last year and triple overtime in 2008 and 2010. Those three games were all in Lancaster; the last meeting in Allentown was a relative blowout, with Muhlenberg winning 10-8.</p>
<p>It could be another close one. Although the Mules come in 2-4 and the Diplomats 5-1 and receiving votes in the national poll, both teams played at Susquehanna with similar results: Muhlenberg won 9-7, and F&amp;M won 9-8 in overtime.</p>

<p><strong>Women&#8217;s Lacrosse vs. Franklin &amp; Marshall (Saturday, 1:00)</strong></p>
<p>As close as the men&#8217;s series with F&amp;M has been, the women&#8217;s has gone the other way. The Mules are winless in 28 all-time games against the Diplomats, but they will try to change that after getting off to a 3-0 start.</p>
<p>F&amp;M (3-1), which won national championships in 2007 and 2009, is tied for eighth in the Division III poll.</p>

<p><strong>Baseball at Susquehanna (Friday, 3:30); vs. Penn State Brandywine (Saturday, 12:00 doubleheader)</strong></p>
<p>The Mules (10-3) can surpass their win total of 11 from all of last season by winning two of these three games. Saturday&#8217;s games are the first at home for Muhlenberg this season.</p>

<p><strong>Men&#8217;s Tennis at New Jersey (Sunday, 1:00)</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s the first Division III match of the season for Muhlenberg. <a title="men's tennis preview" href="http://www.muhlenberg.edu/main/athletics/spring12/0316page2.html">Click here </a>for a season preview.</p>
