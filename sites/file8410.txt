								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s bizarre to think of the world without the internet. Society has become so accustomed to the use of it, that it is odd to think that there once was a time that it did not exist. The initial use of technology has now become so prevalent in the work force, that everyone often forgets that not too long ago, it was not available at the tough of your finger tips. You could not just email a presentation to your boss or type up word documents and spreadsheets. These new perks all made their appearance in the late 80s and 90s after the internet was first conceived. Patricia Wallace, the author of <i>The Internet In The Workplace</i>, refers to the internet as a ‘desktop gateway to the world.’ She explains,“It changed the context of work, the context of business in general, and the context of entire industries” (Wallace, 2004, p. 2).</p>
<p>The birth of the internet did indeed create a whole new dynamic of the work place with the help of these new technologies. Patricia discusses how the use of the internet helps assist companies in many ways, the most being the 24/7 access. It’s now possible for an employee to work even when they are not physically sitting in their office. All aspects of a company can be accessed from the outside. Other employees can be contacted, work can be done, and information can be sent to different people. It is also much easier for training new employees. It prevents you from having to waste both time and money. This new learning, e-learning, makes it much easier for both companies and future employees.</p>
<p>Technology has infiltrated the work force, and it is overall for the better. The workplace endured a technological revolution that is increasingly improved it. Some may ask whether that is a positive or negative. Why would it be a negative? It has brought many great aspects to the workforce that were did not exist many year ago.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Without a doubt, technology has made an incredible impact on the lives of young adults in such an extensive amount of ways. Additionally, &#8220;technology has certainly transformed our libraries. Public Internet access is available at almost every public library, even the smallest and most rural&#8221; (Walter &amp; Myers, 2003, p.50). Young adults have grown up in such a rapidly changing technological era that they automatically expect to see computers when they visit the library, and librarians in return expect to see teens actively using the computers. A recent study funded by the Pew Charitable Trust found that at least 78% of all young people between the ages of twelve and seventeen go online for school or personal use (Walter &amp; Myers, 2003). The number of homes with computers and Internet access has grown significantly over the last several years so much to the point that students themselves are concerned about the digital divide. At times, it can be difficult to be forced to rely on home computers for school assignments, and computers may not always be adequate for purposes of certain assignments (Walter &amp; Myers, 2003).</p>
<p>In an effort to try to keep up with the constant developments of new technologies, public libraries have started providing technologically savvy homework helpers who can accommodate teens&#8217; need for information and their preference for digital media. Young adults have found that the Internet not only assists with communication amongst friends and family, but they also feel that the Internet gives them a broader voice (Walter &amp; Myers, 2003). &#8220;Through electronic discussion lists and chat rooms, they can speak and listen to a far more diverse community than they can in their own geographical neighborhoods&#8221; (Walter &amp; Myers, 2003, p.50).</p>
<p>Since the Internet provides users with unlimited access to information, it is so important to be careful of how you use the Internet. As mentioned in several Ted Talks and in articles discussed in class in regards to privacy, especially now in the digital age, it is becoming more important than ever to be cognizant of what you are searching, downloading, and signing up for. With that in mind, young adults deserve the right to prove themselves as being responsible Internet users until a problem occurs. The Internet is such a useful, convenient, tool, it just needs to be used for appropriate purposes.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In today’s society, I think that it is safe to say that we can’t live without the Internet. Through using the Internet, we have access right at our fingertips to news, social media, and numerous search engines such as Google and Yahoo. Since we can so easily access the Internet, sources like the newspaper are becoming less important. Anything we come across in the newspaper, chances are we will be able to find on the Internet faster.</p>
<p>An incredible social media tool that the Internet provides us access to is Facebook. It has been in existence for just over ten years now, and is the most popular social media website, attracting more than 1.49 billion users (Reddy, 2015). Facebook also allows us to view news, more specifically though, news that typically targets human interest. The Internet is “increasingly impacting all spheres of life across the world” (Reddy, 2015). It is coming to a point where people are becoming dependent on Facebook, and some people want to get connected to the Internet solely so that they can become active on Facebook. Before the Internet, not only did we not have access to Facebook, but we also relied heavily on resources such as newspapers, magazines, and radio to find out information. Google and Facebook are continually becoming more popularized in today’s society since they contain such a significant amount of information and serve as such a beneficial tool in our daily lives. It is said that “Facebook and Google will continue to dominate the online space” (Reddy, 2015). Both tools wouldn’t have been made possible without the Internet. The Internet now allows us to search for potential jobs, conduct research, connect with people nationwide, and so much more. It is because of reasons like these that Facebook and Google will continue to dominate our online world and keep us coming back. Having access to so many incredible tools myself in today’s society, it is hard to imagine what life would be like without the Internet. In conclusion, the ways in which we benefit from Internet access in today’s society are endless. This generation has brought us more technological resources than ever before.</p>
