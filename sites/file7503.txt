								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">           Jim Groom lead an intriguing discussion about who controls what you do and what you put online. He played a video in which a person ordering pizza was shocked to learn the pizza place had access to a lot of personal information like his social security number and his health records. Although this was uploaded years ago to predict the future, it is a pretty accurate representation of how easily anyone can find your personal information online. Just this past weekend I ordered a pizza for my friends and I. In the middle of the conversation, the pizza employee said, “this is abigail right?” He then proceeded to repeat my location to make sure he was delivering to the correct place. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">           Looks of shock and disgust filled the classroom as we continued to talk about how easy it is for perfect strangers to know very personal life details. Although many parents try to come up with extremely unique names in order to have their kid stand out in life, it may be backfiring on the internet. Jim Groom mentioned that someone with a very typical or average name like John Smith remains anonymous. There are so many people that pop up when you google search that name that there is no differentiating. In the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Domain of One’s Own in a Post</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, Watter’s states, [it is important] “</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> having the space and safety and security”  (2016). However, because of the our lack of controlled ownership, anything we post online is owned by private companies. Therefore it is easily accessible for anyone to see our personal information. Our lack of knowledge and ignorance about this allows us to fall victim to these online companies that control blogs and social media. Becoming educated on this topic, has helped me become aware of how little I control and I will definitely be taking more precautions in the future about how much information I give out. </span><span style="font-weight: 400"> Despite the fact that we are considered digital natives, most of us lack the knowledge to make informed decisions regarding the internet and how we use it. </span></p>
