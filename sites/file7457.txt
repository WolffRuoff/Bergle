<p>This past weekend was the first of many trips that I hope to take throughout this semester abroad. After a scheduled trip to Florence with the Accademia, a few of my friends and I decided to go to Cinque Terre, a portion of the western coast of Italy that is composed of five towns, each with their own beaches and restaurants.</p>
<p>We spent all day Friday in Florence and went on a walking tour with Monica (the den momma of the academia) in the morning. We got to see the Duomo, historic landmarks, and the uffici (basically town hall). After the tour was over we had the rest of the days to ourselves, so naturally we went exploring!</p>

<p>Florence is famous for its leather, which is also famous for being pricey, unless you go to the open market. There are a few streets in the city that are filled with different tents and stands that are selling anything from leather jackets and purses, to scarves and watches. A bunch of us really wanted leather but didn&#8217;t want to spend a lot of money so we headed there for the day. I found a really nice satchel and my friend Ryan found a really cool leather banded watch which we both saved a ton of money on because we went to the market and not one of the stores. A couple of other friends splurged a little bit more but came home with beautiful leather and souvenirs. After looking at hundreds of purses and leather jackets, and resisting purchasing as much as possible, we decided it was time to check into our hostel for the night and get some dinner in our bellies.</p>
<p>I have never stayed in a hostel before and was a little nervous about the experience. It also didn&#8217;t help that we had booked one of the cheaper places which meant that it was a much further walk from the center of Florence and a little tricky to find. After a couple of wrong turns and about an hour of added walking time we finally reached the hostel and it was extremely overwhelming. The thing about hostels is that unless you book with your friends, you have no idea who you are going to be living with for the night, which for me coming from a small town and then going to a small school was definitely a new and unfamiliar experience. As the night went on and we got more settled into the new environment I started to feel more comfortable and more adjusted. We ate a ton of food at the buffet at the hostel and even befriended two girls from Mexico who were in our room for the night. It was cool to meet other travelers and hear about their stories and where they were coming from.</p>
<p>After the first night in the hostel we checked out fairly early so that we could get to the beach as soon as possible, because who wants to get to the beach late? Nobody!  After about two hours of train rides we finally made it to Cinque Terre and it was SPECTACULAR!!  I have never seen bluer water, brighter skies, or prettier beaches.  Everywhere we looked there was another breathtaking sight to behold and I did not mind at all.We decided to go to Monterosso which is considered the best beach on the coast, and we were not disappointed.  After we got settled, a bunch of us dove right into the Mediterreanean sea.  The water was perfect!  It was so clear and blue, and a big change from the atlantic ocean on the jersey shore that I am used to.  We swam all day and I even rented a paddle board and went out on the water (I definitely was not the most graceful having never paddle boarded before, but I eventually got it)  We ended the day eating lots of pesto (which Cinque Terre is famous for) while watching the sunset and chatting about our days.</p>

<p>We stayed in a hostel again from Saturday to Sunday but this time it was a little different.  It is quite expensive to book a hostile on the actual coast of Cinque Terre so we all decided to do things a little differently and go camping!  Now, it was not sleeping bags and tents on the beach (I promise mom I was safe!) but instead we got two person house tents.  It was so cool and we felt like quite the adventurers.</p>
<div id="attachment_3012" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/09/housetent.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3012" class="size-medium wp-image-3012" src="http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/09/housetent-300x168.jpg" alt="The House Tents!" width="300" height="168" srcset="http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/09/housetent-300x168.jpg 300w, http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/09/housetent-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-3012" class="wp-caption-text">The House Tents!</p></div>
<p>The next day we decided to go to a different beach on the coast, Manarola, which is famous for its fifteen foot cliff that swimmers jump off of into the water.  When we got to the beach we immediately saw swimmers both young and old jumping off of the rock and of course we all had to try.  Now fifteen feet doesn&#8217;t seem so bad until you are standing on the ledge looking down AND you realize that it is low tide and the drop has probably almost doubled.  I still can&#8217;t believe that I jumped, but it was the most exhilarating and liberating experiences of my life and I am so glad I did it.  If you would like to see the highly embarrassing but equally awesome video of the jump just click the link!</p>

<p>I am so thankful that I have the opportunity to travel while I am here in Italy, but it was really nice to come home to the villa.  This was also the first time that I have really considered the villa home.  Before it was just a vacation spot or a summer camp, but after traveling and coming back to it, I really do feel at home.  I am exhausted and currently have to do all the philosophy homework that I put off all weekend (oops), so until next time, Ciao!</p>

				<p>The homecoming football game is a quintessential college experience. One that for my friends and I, would not be missed under any circumstances. Even the torrential downpour (that may be a slight exaggeration) could not stop us from being in attendance.</p>
<p>Despite our soaking bodies, the dominant Mules football team had us beaming with excitement. The rain even added some dramatic effect to the scene while giving us an excuse to cuddle up and cheer. Luckily, Muhlenberg prevailed and we all left satisfied. Hot chocolate and a rainy day movie capped off a perfect first homecoming. Until next time, go Mules!!</p>

				<p>As everyone knows, this past weekend we had all the alumni back, which always turns out to be a fun weekend. There were a lot of events set up for all of the alumni, and it seems like they really enjoy being back at school. One of the big events was the golf outing on Friday. There was about 200 alumni there for what is a really great event. I was fortunate enough to work it and had the chance to meet some really nice former Mules. I had some great conversations, and since I was wearing a Muhlenberg baseball shirt a lot of the former players came up and started talking to me.</p>
<p>Since next year I will be an alumni (which is scary enough as it is) I think this will be a fun weekend to come back for. It will be nice getting the chance to see everyone that I probably hadn&#8217;t seen in a while. I also want to be in the golf tournament next year because I think that would be a lot of fun.</p>
<p>One thing that can&#8217;t be ignored is how well Muhlenberg sports did over the weekend. We had some big wins in a lot of sports, including soccer and football. It&#8217;s great when our sports teams perform well, especially when a lot of former athletes are back visiting the school.</p>
<p>Something that most people I spoke to kept bringing up was that I really need to enjoy every second I have left at school. Many of the guys I had previously played baseball with told me how much they miss college. There is no doubt that I will take everything in from my senior year.</p>

				<p>Hey there!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m Felisa, and I am one of the new additions to this student blogsphere, and I am so excited to write about my journey here at Muhlenberg College.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s some background: I was born and raised on the small island of St. Thomas in the Caribbean, and coming to Muhlenberg was my first time officially living in the states. Since my move I&#8217;ve adapted to stateside living, you know&#8230; running through a pile of leaves during the fall, going on the hunt for the perfect pumpkin, surviving my first winter, seeing my first snowflake, making my first snowman, making new friends, being introduced to Target, and ever since then, Muhlenberg has become my second home. Transitioning was difficult, quite the culture shock in all honesty, but I&#8217;ve learned, I&#8217;ve laughed and now I&#8217;m officially loving it here! Who would&#8217;ve thought that little old island girl Felisa would love Allentown, PA. I went from paradise to&#8230; Pennsylvania? Most would flock to the islands not away from them&#8230;</p>
<div id="attachment_2983" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/09/73309_455947554459337_1913626874_n.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2983" class="size-medium wp-image-2983" src="http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/09/73309_455947554459337_1913626874_n-300x300.jpg" alt="First snow!" width="300" height="300" srcset="http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/09/73309_455947554459337_1913626874_n-300x300.jpg 300w, http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/09/73309_455947554459337_1913626874_n-150x150.jpg 150w, http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/09/73309_455947554459337_1913626874_n.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2983" class="wp-caption-text">First snow!</p></div>
<p>Currently, I am a second semester sophomore (took a semester off a while back), but I usually just say I&#8217;m a junior because I <strong>will</strong> be graduating with my class, even if I have to take 5 courses every semester until graduation. This past week has been hectic. I finally declared my major (Media Communications) and minor (Philosophy), got my new advisors, got a 2nd job on campus and got my very first internship with the Office of Campus Sustainability. Thinking of how far I&#8217;ve come is quite humorous actually. I came here wanting to major in Film Studies and minor in Creative Writing, but I&#8217;ve obviously strayed far from that path. However, this is the last time I&#8217;m doing any paperwork, so I&#8217;m sticking with my major and minor, plus, I already have half my requirements done for each so it makes absolutely no sense to change it again.</p>
<p>On campus I&#8217;m very involved, from being a part of the Activities Council, to being a representative on Student Government. I sit on a few student advisory boards, I work in the President&#8217;s Office, and I&#8217;m a member of the Cardinal Key Society and the Multicultural Center&#8217;s Emerging Leaders Program. I love being active. It kind of gives me a purpose on this campus and on top of that, I hate being bored.</p>

<p>This weekend is Homecoming Weekend, and it&#8217;ll be my first time working as a member of the Cardinal Key Society. Supposedly it&#8217;s one of the most hectic weekends in the fall semester; I guess I&#8217;ll find out in a few days. During Homecoming Weekend, the Alumni Office plans out events that vary from campus tours, class dinners, bird watching expeditions, ceremonies, a fair with hot air balloon rides and department receptions, to  football, soccer, and field hockey games&#8230; Anything you can think of that requires school spirit, it&#8217;s probably occurring this weekend! And I get to wake up every day at 6:45am to help set up for it! (Well, not everyday, on one of those days I am not scheduled to set up until 7:45am&#8211; a whole hour! I simply can&#8217;t contain my excitement&#8230;)</p>
<p>Until next time,</p>
<p>Felisa W.</p>

				<p>Hey Everyone!</p>
<p>I can’t believe it’s already my Junior year at Muhlenberg. Wow, how the time has flown! I’m from Westchester, NY but in all honesty, I feel like Muhlenberg is my home. Even the clock tower that rings every hour has become part of my daily stride. Ok I admit, I do occasionally complain about the hourly reminder that, YES I AM STILL STUDYING!</p>
<p>Although I would love to catch you all up on my past two years at Muhlenberg, you would be here reading this for about a decade (this is not exaggeration)! Instead, I would love to tell you all about this amazing new year ahead of me! This year is especially exciting because I will be spending this semester at Muhlenberg and next semester in Israel at Hebrew University. Yes, I will continue to blog while I’m abroad so stay tuned (cue dramatic music)! Even though I’m a Neuroscience major and Public Health minor, I will be using my semester abroad to expand my knowledge by taking different types of classes (yay Liberal Arts education)!</p>
<p>Although I could talk about my excitement for next semester for another twenty pages, I am also loving this semester so far! Right now I’m living in my sorority house, which has been a ton of fun. This past weekend was Bid Day and we got an additional 31 awesome members!</p>
<div id="attachment_2973" style="width: 235px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/09/image1.jpeg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2973" class="size-medium wp-image-2973" src="http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/09/image1-225x300.jpeg" alt="A picture of my sorority's new pledge class! " width="225" height="300" srcset="http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/09/image1-225x300.jpeg 225w, http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/09/image1-768x1024.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2973" class="wp-caption-text">My sorority&#8217;s new pledge class!</p></div>
<p>Overall it was a super chaotic but really exciting weekend, ignoring the sweltering heat. I guess it’s better than the monsoon of rainfall that typically happens in the Lehigh Valley. Ok, I’m kidding but sometimes it’s hard to tell when you feel like you need goggles to get to class.</p>
<p>‘Till next time,</p>
<p>Ariel</p>
