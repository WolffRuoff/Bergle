<p>During the 2018-2019 academic year, Sasha Cheer ‘19, a Media and Communication and Theatre double major, created a timeline around the history of theatre at Muhlenberg College. Sasha approached Susan Falciani Maldonado, Special Collections and Archives Librarian, in 2016 at a transcribing event that was held in the library. She spoke about being drawn to old things, about how sad it was that letter-writing was a dying art, and that she would be interested in learning more about what was held in the College’s archives. Eventually, as happens with archival internships, the right collection, student, and digital tool came together in the shape of a theatre timeline. Sasha began the project as an independent study to fulfill her theatre history requirement, under the supervision of Falciani Maldonado and Dr. Beth Schachter, Director of Women&#8217;s &amp; Gender Studies and Associate Professor of Theatre. The project grew beyond the scope of one semester, and Sasha diligently continued to work on it in her spare time through the rest of the academic year. </p>

<p>Sasha showed thoughtfulness when encountering problematic material in the archives: for example, she encountered a performance in 1931 featuring students wearing blackface. Sasha consulted with the archivist and with a faculty mentor about how best to represent this performance. She was very concerned about not obscuring the story, but did not want to reproduce the visual online. In the end, Sasha decided to openly discuss the problematic nature of the event, while providing references to the physical archival material.</p>



<p>We asked Sasha, who is about to embark on a year of teaching in Japan, to reflect on her experience working on the timeline, which can be <a href="http://trexler.muhlenberg.edu/library/specialcollections/digitalprojects/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">viewed</a> on the Special Collections section of the library website.</p>



<p><strong>What drew you to this project/ what made you approach the archivist?</strong></p>



<p>I would not call myself a history buff, but I love old things&#8211;there is an aesthetic to them that always holds the promise of a good story. I can&#8217;t recall how I met our archivist, Susan Falciani, but I do have distinct memories of coming to her and having conversations about the history of our buildings and [asking] &#8220;why do we have this here?&#8221; merely out of curiosity&#8217;s sake. Therefore, I was already well-acquainted with her when I decided to undertake this project. &#8220;Muhlenberg&#8221; has become synonymous with &#8220;Theatre,&#8221; as our program has gained more and more prestige. And yet, when I asked how we became so well-known for Theatre, the answer I always received was a shrug and &#8220;Charlie Richter.&#8221; Charlie has been around for about 40 years, which for a human lifetime is very long, but in the perspective of history, is a very short time. What was <em>before</em> Charlie Richter? No one in the Theatre Department seemed to have any answer for me. And as I learned over my years in both high-school and college, if no one knows, then the archivist will&#8211;and if the archivist doesn&#8217;t know, then they just haven&#8217;t gotten there yet. There are few things more tempting than discovering the answer to something no one has any idea about.</p>



<p><strong>Why do you think this work is important?</strong></p>



<p>Theatre is ephemeral. So much work, effort, blood, sweat, and tears are put into a few single spectacular moments that will be gone the instant the show is over, never to be repeated the same way ever again. It is performed for the here and now, for the community of living and breathing and feeling together. It is easy to neglect documenting the past of something that is only built for the moment. Our grip on future moments can be built stronger if we remember the story the moments of the past create.</p>



<p><strong>What was the most interesting thing that you learned/discovered?</strong></p>



<p>The people, for sure! It&#8217;s so hard to envision the names we come across in the newspapers and yearbooks as once living, breathing, working humans! Some of these people I came across had as great an effect on Muhlenberg&#8217;s campus and throughout Allentown as much as some folks in our current department have, and it was just wonderful to imagine them walking our halls, worried over grades, thinking about auditions, taking trips into New York, petitioning for more budget, promising one another that the next production will be great, and just working SO hard for performances no alive can now recall.</p>



<p><strong>What from this experience will you carry forward into your future?</strong></p>



<p>An archivist&#8217;s work is never done! There is so much I discovered that I was unable to include. The work emphasizes precision, and no college research paper ever required the research skill levels this project did&#8211;trying to track things down is like trying to find a needle in a haystack. It&#8217;s a whole skill-set in itself that I haven&#8217;t mastered yet&#8211;though (shout out to our current archivist, Susan) who can do it<em> beautifully</em>, like snapping her fingers!</p>



<p><strong>How did this play into your theatre major?</strong></p>



<p>The content of the timeline was Theatre oriented which got me thinking about history and the nature of performance, but the documentation of the timeline was more closely related to my Media &amp; Communications major, which had me think about appropriate presentation of facts, and non-biased engagement. Additionally, I did a curatorship of some of the archived material halfway through the year, which utilized a sort of Visual Arts approach to its arrangement and creation.<br></p>
