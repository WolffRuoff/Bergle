								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">            Growing up my life did not revolve around technology. My parents were strict with my television use and I only used the computer for homework as we only had two desktops to share with all the siblings. It was extremely weird for me to go to my friends’ houses where there was no restriction on television use. However, my parents’ restriction on technology never seemed like a constraint. My mom was a stay at home mom so she was able to keep me occupied with constant activity. I distinctly remember my kindergarten schedule. I had afternoon kindergarten so I spent the morning cooking breakfast and going to classes for things like tennis or art. My mom and I would also indulge in watching The Price is Right once in awhile. Besides that show, I don&#8217;t remember watching many others. I did not notice how little television I watched until my best friend started talking about it one day. She was excitedly telling me about her favorite shows like Hannah Montana and Suite life of Zack and Cody. I just stood there nodding even though I had never heard of those shows before. That was the first time I felt out of the loop for not using constant technology. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">          It wasn&#8217;t until I received a phone in 6th grade that I started to really use technology. However, my phone had limited capabilities as I could only text and call. This was useful for chatting with friends and making plans but It wasn&#8217;t glued to my side like it is today. My real technology use did not start until 8th grade when I got my first smartphone and my very own laptop. This was also the time that my parents allowed me to get my first social media account, Facebook. I was ecstatic that I was able to get facebook because it  was the latest craze for middle schoolers. I remember my friends complaining that they had to be facebook friends with their parents so they could monitor their posts. I felt lucky because my mother did not have a facebook and my dad explicitly told me to not friend him because his account was for business only. Getting my first friend request was exhilarating because it gave me validation that people knew who I was and wanted to be facebook friends. Although many people say facebook has died out, I still use it to this day. I find it very useful to message someone if I don&#8217;t have their phone number and contact a large number of people through Facebook groups. In the article called Teens, Social Media &amp; Technology Overview 2015, Lenhart says “</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Facebook remains the most used social media site&#8230;with </span><span style="font-weight: 400">71% of all teens using the site</span><span style="font-weight: 400">.” (1998, p.1) Although people may not actively use facebook as much as other sites, I think that most people have an account to stay connected and I find myself in that category. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">                Despite the fact I did not use technology much as a young girl, it is now part of my everyday life. Growing up with many siblings, I saw the evolution of technology right from my own home. My brothers who are 6 years older, did not receive their first cell phone until 9th grade and their own laptops until college. My sister, who is four years older than me, received her first phone in 7th grade and got her own laptop in 10th grade. The pattern continues on to me and then finally to my little sister who received her first phone in 5th grade and her first laptop in 6th grade. My siblings and I were raised by the same people but we were given technology at different ages. At first I was upset that my little sister received all of these fancy gadgets at a younger age. However, I soon realized that it wasn&#8217;t my parents playing favorites but rather an attempt to to help her social standing with friends and academic standing in school. Through the evolution of my family, I was able to see how the progression of technology makes it more prevalent at younger ages. </span></p>
