					<div class="entry-content">
				<p>There were many highlights this past week filled with dance, music, and travel. On Tuesday, Jena and I went to Dublin City University&#8217;s All Ireland Dance Experiment- In Your Dreams show. There were performances by DCU&#8217;s dance groups, as well as dance groups from Trinity College and other schools around Ireland. My favorite part of the show was the Irish step dance. As a dance major, I have studied and observed a lot of dance, but I have never really had an opportunity to see Irish step, so it was very exciting. Also, one of our new Irish friends danced in the show, so we were happy to see her perform!</p>
<p>For Valentine&#8217;s Day, on campus, they had a huge dance, or as they call it here, a &#8220;ball&#8221;. It was really just a concert by The Original Rude Boys, a popular band from Ireland. I had never heard of them before, but they were really good!</p>
<p>Early Saturday morning, Leah, Hallie, Jena and I headed for Galway, Ireland. It was about a 2-and-a-half-hour bus ride. This was my first hostel experience. I was a little nervous, but it was actually kind of fun! We met two girls from Germany that were staying in our same room. After arriving, we grabbed lunch at a cute cafe. It was one of the best meals I&#8217;ve had here! Then we explored around the city. We came to Galway with two specific things we wanted to find: claddagh rings and wool sweaters. We were very successful! The claddagh is a symbol that is said to be founded in Galway. It includes a heart with a crown on top all being held with two hands. These three things represent loyalty, love, and friendship. I bought a necklace and a ring with this design when I visited Ireland 3 years ago with my family, but, sadly, I lost the ring last year. So once we arrived in Galway, we went back to the same store I bought the original to buy another. I couldn&#8217;t have been more excited to get my ring back!</p>
<p>The second purchase we all wanted was real Irish wool sweaters. This was a more difficult task than we had expected. We looked in every wool sweater shop and didn&#8217;t make our final decisions until the second day we were there. It was definitely worth the time though, because I am obsessed with my new sweater! On Sunday afternoon before we left to catch our bus back to Dublin, we went on a free walking tour of the city. We saw the Spanish Arch and learned a lot about the history of Galway. It was overall a very successful first overnight visit outside of Dublin!</p>

				<p>This past weekend, I had the chance to participate in Master Choreographers, which is the faculty dance concert that takes place once a year. While I primarily spend most of my time in the theatre, it was really nice to experience what it is like to be a part of the dance community. I love to tap dance, so being able to work on a tap piece (even though I am a theatre and business double major) with an amazing faculty member was really exciting. </p>
<p>As an added bonus, we did the dance with a live band for each performance. Being a part of the piece was really special. As a senior in the concert, I was also able to take a couple of professional dance photos for publicity. There were so many wonderful opportunities associated with this performance and such a strong community. I can wholeheartedly say that the dance community at Muhlenberg is really special. I have a video below with some of the highlights from the week. Enjoy!</p>

				<p>It is so strange to say that I am only going into my second week of living in Dublin. I already feel like I&#8217;ve been here forever and absolutely love it! My first week of classes were great. I&#8217;m taking the Politics of Media Reform with Dr. Sullivan (our Muhlenberg faculty on the trip), Crime &amp; the Media, and Photojournalism. I am especially excited for my photojournalism class because it will force me to take great pictures over the course of the semester. Also this week, we have befriended some of the Irish students. Two in particular, Emmy and Deirbhile, have been amazing about teaching us Irish lingo and I promised to give them a shout out in my blog! So here&#8217;s lesson #1 of Irish lingo, instead of saying &#8220;What&#8217;s up?&#8221;, you say &#8220;What&#8217;s the craic?&#8221;.</p>
<p>This past weekend, as most of the Irish students go home on the weekends, a few of us decided to explore the city some more. On Saturday, we went to the most amazing restaurant, Queen of Tarts, for brunch. I think I could have easily eaten everything on that menu followed by every dessert on the menu. They had everything from pancakes to omelets to savory tarts and sweet tarts. It was to die for! After eating everything we possibly could, we walked to a nearby Farmer&#8217;s Market. There were local farmers and venues selling vegetables, cheeses, and meats. It was a fun, lazy afternoon in the city filled with food and shopping!</p>

<p>Sunday was not a particularly beautiful day, as it was cold and rainy, but it&#8217;s Ireland so we embraced the day regardless. Hallie, Jena, and I headed to the train station for a quick 20 minute ride to escape to Howth, a quaint fishing town, for the afternoon. We walked around the town, took a million pictures like tourist (of course!), and grabbed some lunch before heading back. However, the ride back was not as successful as the ride there. We accidentally overshot our stop by 5 stops, whoops! Once we realized this, we all looked at each other, burst out laughing, and got off at the next stop. Thank goodness for a nice Irish lady that pointed us in the right direction. We made it back safe and sound thanks to the nice people of Ireland! My next out of Dublin experience will be next weekend, as I travel to the other side of the country to Galway.</p>

				<p>Well folks, I know you haven&#8217;t heard from me for a while. My semester has gotten off to a good start. It was certainly odd to be back on muhlenberg&#8217;s campus after my abroad experience, but through the strange mass of emotions, I can tell that I am happy to be back. I missed my friends and my professors and the community. It&#8217;s home to me now.</p>
<p>I arrived back to move into a suite with 3 other people who I didn&#8217;t really know at all. It turns out that they&#8217;re all pretty awesome, and I really like the suite&#8217;s dynamic. My classes have definitely left me no choice but to hit the ground running. I am taking more credits this semester than I ever have, and it certainly has kept me busy. (I hardly even had time to decorate my door for Chinese new year! The horror! (pictures to come (hopefully (okay parenthetical spree over))))</p>
<p>What&#8217;s new this semester? I&#8217;m working in two new locations for my work study job with the bio department (the greenhouse and the genetics lab), I&#8217;m doing some cool new techniques in my research lab which are intimidating but also exciting, as I mentioned, I&#8217;m now living in a suite, which is, sweet (pun intended), I&#8217;m starting in on my neuroscience coursework with Psychopharmacology and Receptors &amp; Channels, and of course I&#8217;m in a bunch of new and exciting classes! I&#8217;ll update more soon, but for now I&#8217;ve got to run to rehearsal. Tramps like us, baby we were born to run.</p>

				<p>Hey everyone.</p>
<p>After a long journey through many airports, I have made it safely home. I’m only just beginning to experience all the reverse culture shock that we were warned we might experience. It is sincerely challenging to attempt to talk about my semester abroad, but more challenging than talking about these transformative three months is describing the smaller moments. How do I convey to other people who “Yohannah” is? I can tell them he was kind and cheerful, sage and pensive and always greeted you with “Aaaaloooo”, but that’s not Yohannah, not even close.</p>
<p>How does one respond to “How was Africa?” Good? Awesome? Great? All adjectives that might apply, but don’t say anything about anything. Each day I spent in Tanzania and Kenya deserves its own moment, its own stories to be told. In preparing myself to come back to the states, I told myself that people were going to say things that are honestly good intentioned, but may really bother me. I don’t want to be that presumptuous guy offended over something that was said in good humor because I’ve “experienced so much more than you” or whatever. Still, when people say “Welcome back to civilization” I can’t help but get a little irritated. Civilization? As though Kenya and Tanzania are something other than civilization? Surely, whoever would say that to me doesn’t mean the countries are uncivilized, but rather that I was in a more rural, remote area of a country and now I’m right back into a suburb of NYC. Yes, I get that. So then why can’t I help being miffed by comments in that vein?</p>
<p>When I saw these two countries and met the people of them, I won’t say I was downright surprised, but that’s only because I had an extremely unhindered mindset entering the experience. I didn’t know what I was expecting at all. However, if I had to guess, I bet I’d have been surprised by the cultures, the countries, the animals and the people.</p>
<p>I know everyone who will want to hear about my trip would also most likely be surprised as well, but I can’t give them that experience and I can’t explain a culture or a people or anything like that in words and still do it justice. On top of that, how many people who ask about the trip will only want to hear me say “Great. Saw tons of lions, here’s a few pictures” and how many sincerely want to hear me say “You may fall on your knees with tears in your eyes, heartbeats thrumming with the pounding of a million drummers and gaze upon the endless plains and still not yet begin to understand the freedom of the wilderness” how many will be able to devote the time and effort to understanding who I am and who I have become?</p>
<p>That’s silly to ask of everyone, and it would again be presumptuous to ask people not to ask about my trip unless they’re ready for an ongoing dialogue about these kinds of things. People have their own lives, and above all, nobody wants to be told that they just can’t understand something. How to make them understand that it’s no shortcoming of theirs or mine, just an inadequacy of words to properly convey feelings and ideas? It’s like saying “I know this really great secret, and I wish I could tell you, but you wouldn’t understand”.</p>
<p>Sitting at the fire pit, watching the dying embers of hundreds of sheets of notes and research papers, management plans and charts that we set alight in celebration of the end of the semester’s classes, a girl turned to me and shared the common sentiment that she knew it would be frustrating when a million little moments were incommunicable to those she loved back home. It got me to thinking, and we talked about it. In the end, it seems, I’ll probably be able to convey a lot of the experiences I’ve had at face value. And as for the little things, the moments watching the sun set on the Serengeti, or the changes in who I am and what I care about, those are things that maybe I can’t ever communicate to someone who wasn’t there with me, but maybe those are things that are meant to be my own, and only mine, forever. Perhaps some things don’t translate into words for me because there are things that I need to hold onto for myself and in their silence, let them be.</p>
