					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I really enjoy history and think this blog is a great idea!  When I was in school we had the basic textbook American history and even though I lived in Maine, never any history specific to the state.  I&#039;m looking forward to what you&#039;ll be digging up!
Thanks for sharing.&lt;/p&gt;
