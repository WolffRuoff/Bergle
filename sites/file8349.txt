					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I really like how you mentioned that people choose to act differently online. This concept relates to the idea of &quot;the polished profile&quot; in which people elect to display only certain things on their social media accounts. In doing so, people neglect to include serious issues that they may have encountered or may be encountering. A prime example of this is Madison Holleran who was from Allendale, NJ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Madison was a student-athlete at the University of Pennsylvania where she competed in track and field. By looking at her Instagram account, you would have thought that Madison was living an ideal life. She appeared to be doing well academically, athletically, and socially. Unfortunately, Madison was experiencing struggles that were not displayed on her Instagram account. Madison ultimately decided to end it all on the evening of January 17, 2014 when she took a running leap off the ninth story of a Philadelphia parking garage. She was 19 years old. Her story reinforces the notion that you brought up. That is, that people do not act the same way online as they do in person.&lt;/p&gt;
