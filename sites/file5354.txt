								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;ve all been working incredibly hard to prepare an awesome script for the play in the fall. Working all day conducting interviews, transcribing interviews, and then working all night trying to find lines that are the most powerful, that should ultimately make it into the play.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve conducted 60 interviews &#8211; almost 70 hours of material that we need to cut down to a 30 minute play.</p>
<p>This photo was taken in rehearsal when my laptop died and we thought we&#8217;d lost the last 4 hours of work. Everyone&#8217;s holding hands praying that Microsoft Autorecovery works as well at it claims.</p>

<p>Our prayers were answered, our work was saved, and now we only have 20 interviews left to process! Getting closer to turning some serious discussion into serious art-making.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi all! So we’ve started doing performances, and it’s been really exciting! Two performances down, eight to go! And I’m starting to get packed for my jetsetting off to India (right after our last performance.) This whole week is a little crazy.</p>
<p>But I want to go back to those first two performances. One of the things we mention in the play is slut shaming, and there’s been a lot of confusion over just what, exactly, slut shaming is. I figured this blog was the perfect place to put a slightly more comprehensive definition.</p>
<p>Slut shaming is a method by which society discourages people from having sex. Slut shaming is generally a tactic aimed at women, as women are typically held to a more rigid standard of sexual conduct, but a person of any gender can be slut shamed. It is when other community members make comments about the person’s behavior or presentation that admonish them for being more sexual than society deems acceptable.</p>
<p>A person does not actually have to be engaging in any amount of sexual encounters to be called a slut. It is not about behavior, it is about perceived behavior.</p>
<p>The reason slut shaming is bad is that it shapes our perception of rape. If a person experiences slut shaming, it can damage their self perception in the future. But it also devalues their worth as a person. If other people view them as a slut, they are viewing that person as “easy.” That person then becomes the target for rape or sexual harassment because they lack the agency to say no. If they are a slut they are expected to comply with an sexual advance at any time, regardless of if that advance is wanted and reciprocated, or not. Rape allegations from women who are deemed sluts by broader society are taken less seriously, although the event may be just as traumatic for the survivor.</p>
<p>Slut shaming goes hand-in-hand with victim blaming as part of the rape culture that we live in. But you’ll hear more about victim blaming in the show! And maybe I’ll come back and write more about that soon.</p>
<p>Hopefully this clears things up for those of you who were unsure what slut shaming was. The reference may make more sense now. Enjoy the show!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>These last 24 hours are, I think, the most intense 24 hours of the project.<br />
Yesterday morning the ensemble slept in, and then, even once we got up, we really didn’t speak to each other. A sense of angst permeated the entire space.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think we were all dreading rehearsal too much.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last night was script building night. For more information on our process, you can check out <a href="http://sedehidiversityproject.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/2013/08/06/how-we-do-it/">Ben’s awesome post</a>. But let it be said that last night was final trimmings and ordering the lines, as well as preffing which lines we want. We finished Thursday night’s rehearsal with 35 pages of script and we absolutely LOVED every word in it. Unfortunately, the script had to be capped at 18 pages. And we needed to finish the evening’s rehearsal with a finished product</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We were all less concerned than we could’ve been – last year’s ensemble began their final script building night with 100 pages of material, and they were there for 12 hours. Starting at 35 we all kind of figured we’d be out by 1am, or maybe 2am at the latest. That’s late, and 7 or 8 hours of rehearsal late respectively, but still offers a decent night’s sleep. Early in the week we’d worked till 3 anyways, so we figured we were set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So why the pervasive angst?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All nine of us have very different identities. We all believe in the incredible importance of these conversations, but because our lived experiences are different, there was a high chance that the particular topics we’d want addressed would differ. For instance, a lesbian member of the ensemble would want to make sure certain lesbian issues on campus are addressed (for instance the objectification of girl-girl couples or the fact that there are so few out lesbians on campus) while a male gay member of the ensemble would want to make sure certain gay male issues on campus are addressed (for instance the commoditization of the flamboyant gay man in terms of GBF or how performances of masculinity intersect with sexual identity.) These kinds of conflicts exist in multitude for each of our 9 areas we intended to address.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The angst in our apartment, I think, was tension building up among all of us, ready to fight for the importance of our individual identities. We all love each other incredible amounts and would never want to hurt each other, so the looming decisions between what stories we need told and what stories those we love need told was scary. And stressing everybody out a bit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We tried to make rehearsal as painless as possible from the beginning. We all ordered take out and it sort of had that party atmosphere. We knew it would be painful, but we were still intending a 1 or 2 am bed time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We started sorting lines and were doing great! We had a whole 2 pages of the script before we came to a halt. We just couldn’t find anything to fit and were really struggling to continue. At that point Mel, with all her directorial powers, told us that we needed to start cutting lines. We got 20 lines on each subject – it was time to make some choices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cutting out entire dialogues was really hard. There were so many topics that were so important to so many of us. We poured over all the tiny slips of paper for hours. And hours. And hours. But everyone was more civil than I ever could have imagined possible. If our stories had to be cut, it was always in service of the project, because we understood that other stories<i> needed</i> to be told and it was only that our stories should be told. And nothing stops us from telling our stories here or to others elsewhere.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Flow was maybe more important to all of us than it should’ve been. Deciding which lines fit with each other and which experiences were similar in tone despite differences in topic was difficult and grueling but thought provoking in a lot of ways, too. It passed 1am and we definitely weren’t done. It passed 2am and there was no end in sight.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Around 3:45am we had a finished script. In the form of hundreds of tiny slips of paper laid out across a long table. Precisely in order based on our previous 9.75 hours of discussion. Mel typed each slip of paper into an open document on her computer while we watch music videos of ridiculous songs (some of which may be featured in our pre-show! So get excited for that.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By 4:30am the script was finish, typed, printed, and in our hands. It was 18 pages long, but we couldn’t go to bed without a read-through – we had to make sure the script came in under time as well as under length.</p>
<p>At 5am we finished the read through – the script was the perfect length. But also so totally wrong. Things were lost that were absolutely necessary to the conversation. Things were present that were maybe not so important. It felt absolutely horrible for our finished product to feel so wrong after 11 hours of work. So, in we dove again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ripping apart a script that’s taken months of research and transcribing and discussion and decision honestly feels like killing your child. From 6am-7am ensemble members were maybe the most hopeless we’d been. We needed to go through each and every line again, decide how necessary it is, whether or not it flows from the previous line and into the following line, and how we can trim it for length. It just suddenly seemed like such an endless task.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But then, all of a sudden, around 7:15, everything fit again. We’d cut enough and added enough that maybe we could try another read through.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This one was largely successful. Maybe that’s because we were so tired that any script would feel like success, but I do truly think this is an amazing project. Considering the time limitations, I think this says everything we want to say, and is still engaging and beautiful and funny and entertaining and everything the Sedehi Diversity Project should be.  Everyone else agreed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At 8am we were finally finally finally done building our script. We were all so giddy and happy that no one was holding it together. Well, with the exception of Ben Sam and Will R who still sort of were. Someone has our celebratory video (composed of lots of screams of success) so get excited for that!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we left our windowless prison and saw the sun I’m pretty sure Mel melted. She’s probably actually a vampire. Or just hadn’t really realized how late in the day 8am is to still be awake. But probably the former.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After we got back to our apartment I was so wide awake. We’d created something wonderful and put an entire new set of energy into the world! And remained as close, if not closer because of it! How was I supposed to sleep! So I’ve tried to be productive this morning – going on a run, doing my laundry, writing blog posts. But the crash has got to come soon! After being awake for 24 hours, and 14 straight hours of rehearsal, I don’t know how much longer I can function. My condolences go out to Mel, Will R, and Vernon who can’t go to sleep for quite some time. Mel and Will are busy divvying up the script to the performers and giving everybody lines, and Vernon has tour guide duties. I’m sure those prospectives are going to be absolutely overwhelmed with his enthusiasm!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And on that note, I am off to bed. The past 24 hours have cemented our bond as an ensemble, I think. In addition to creating something I think is really wonderful and I hope we can all feel really proud of. So, at 10:30am, I say to you, good night!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I first came to Muhlenberg as a freshman I was hesitant about the college for a lot of reasons. Luckily, orientation demonstrated that I had come to a really great place. Especially seeing the Sedehi Diversity Project for the first time.</p>
<p>Myself, along with one hundred or so freshmen filed into the performance space in our orientation groups, and I was completely unsure of what to expect. Orientation puts you through the wringer &#8211; you&#8217;re busy constantly and completely over stimulated by all the new people you&#8217;re meeting and new experiences you&#8217;re having. That coupled by the hurricane and everyone was a little frazzled. Once we were all seated, the director of the project stood up and introduced the play &#8211; I don&#8217;t even remember what she said &#8211; and then it began.</p>
<p>Students just started talking. And saying things I&#8217;d never heard anyone say before.</p>
<p>The diversity project talks about a lot of topics. Generally, we cover discussions of race, class, gender, sexual orientation, religion, ability (in terms of physical disabilities, learning disabilities, and mental health), body image, and Muhlenberg’s relationship to Allentown.</p>
<p>I honestly did not know people were allowed to talk about these issues. I’d been taught all my life that it was rude to talk about race or class or religion or ability, and why bother talking about sexual orientation or gender – non-normativity in these areas doesn’t exist. And suddenly my peers were all around me being blatantly honest about how they felt.</p>
<p>I realized I fit somewhere. That things I’d been experiencing in my life were real. And that conversations about diversity aren’t rude, they are 100% necessary. All of the time. For every.</p>
<p>I cried during my first viewing of the Sedehi Diversity Project. Four separate times. I’d never thought about ways in which core aspects of my identity had an impact on positive and negative experiences of life. I’d always thought it was just my life and those experiences happened detached from any sense of identity. Just to me. But as it turns out, those positive and negative life experiences are attached to aspects of identity that inform how you interact with everything and everyone!</p>
<p>After the Diversity Project, orientation groups have lengthy discussions about what they’ve seen and their feelings regarding diversity. My orientation group, together, grappled with the loss of the naïve perspective our high schools had taught us. We were shocked by the play and shocked by each other. That day 4 of us came out to each other (be it in official discussion or in conversation amongst ourselves). I’d never come out to any one before and here I was coming out to whole groups of people! Because SDP told me I could!</p>
<p>I think the Sedehi Diversity Project, more than anything else, connects people. It facilitates conversations with people who are different. It facilitates conversation with people who are the same (but didn’t know they were the same at all).  And it starts the most important conversation – a conversation about power and access and how we all interact with each other and the world</p>
