								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ownership. As Watters highlights in her article we have moved further away from ownership. We have little control of what we own and control, especially in an increasingly online and digital world.</p>
<p>This post will challenge you in 3 ways:</p>
<p>Respond to this question: How can something like &#8216;Domain of One&#8217;s Own&#8217; aid students in taking ownership of one&#8217;s own writing and developing one&#8217;s writing process?</p>
<p>Respond to this question: Students take classes. Faculty frame what will be learned in those classes. How does one ultimately take ownership of one&#8217;s own learning and education?</p>
<p>Generate your own questions: based on the reading(s) and online discussions, generate your own questions and respond to each others&#8217; questions as appropriate.</p>
<p>You do not need to respond to each and every question presented above or through the comments from the class, but respond to the questions that have meaning to you, or that will help deepen your understanding of the reading/topic, or where you have insight you want to share about ownership, digital identity, a domain of one&#8217;s own, etc. Do not just answer questions for the sake of answering questions, but to engage more deeply in this online discussion.</p>
<p>Watters, A. (2016, August 23). A domain of oneâ€™s own in a post-ownership society. Retrieved from <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2016/08/23/domains">http://hackeducation.com/2016/08/23/domains.</a></p>
