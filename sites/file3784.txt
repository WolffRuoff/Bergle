					<description><![CDATA[Interesting article, Group 3.  There&#039;s lots of analysis that can be attached to this article here,  though I didn&#039;t necessarily see you include it.  For instance, what do you make of the decision to reach out to faith groups to offer them screenings of the film in advance and discuss it with them?  Which power role is being courted here and how might that reduce some of the risks of this film in the marketplace?  In one sense, the decision to feature Bieber in a film is not necessarily risky at all, though, due to his success in the recording industry.  Here would be a great time to think about Turow&#039;s notion of linking pins and their importance to media industries.  So, you&#039;re on the right track in each of these posts, but a bit more context and analysis would really help - power roles are there to help you better understand what these specific examples mean in the larger context of the industry.  Onwards!]]></description>
