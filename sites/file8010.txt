								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cyberbullying is the use of electronic communication to bully a person, typically by sending messages of an intimidating or threatening nature. According to Pew, &#8220;About one third (32%) of all teenagers who use the internet say they have been targets of a range of annoying and potentially menacing online activities &#8211; such as receiving threatening messages; having their private emails or text messages forwarded without consent; having an embarrassing picture posted without permission; or having rumors about them spread online&#8221;. This study was done in 2006; if this study was done today I believe that the percentage of people that have been bullied online would be higher. Social media has become more popular and there are more social medias out there making it more accessible for bullies to target people online.</p>
<p>To no surprise cyberbullying is more common among girls. Girls are pettier and get involved in drama much more than boys do. Girls can also be very passive to one another and take it online instead so they do not need to face the person. Other than being passive, girls get jealous very easily. So if they think a girl is so great and &#8220;perfect&#8221; they will want to find something wrong with her and try to put her down to make her feel bad. Society puts a lot of pressure on girls to be &#8220;perfect&#8221;, even though there is no such thing. Girls want to be the best; it is a constant competition with other girls. Instead of building each other up (as we should), it is often seen that girls try to tear one another down.</p>
<p>Also the article says that intense Internet users are bullied more. The situation is probably the more you use the Internet, the more one uses social media and is posting more. People judge everything, so if they do not like your post for some reason they may feel the need to let you know.</p>
<p>Lastly, I was very shocked to read that bullying happens more often offline. I feel like now a day most bullying happens online. Again, this article is from 2006 so it could be the other way around now. The screen gives people something to hide behind and most likely say things that they would not say in person.</p>
