								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fall break has arrived, and while the short hiatus is highly necessary for my psyche, it doesn&#8217;t make sense to go home. Although it stings a bit to see all my friends return to their beds, I figured&#8230; Why not make an adventure of the few days off?</p>
<p>Four buddies and I arranged to drive to New York for the night to see a concert, then to Boston for three days (where a friend lives).</p>
<p>Jamming out to good music for long car rides is also a memory in itself. Not to mention, the dense northeast trees from Connecticut to Massachusetts are leaving me mesmerized. They just seem so endless, and to my foreign west coast eyes, the immense greenery is a rare site.</p>
<p>So to shortly answer the question posed in this blog&#8217;s title, &#8220;what does a California kid do during fall break?&#8221; &#8212; lots of cool things. There are many miles ahead until we get to Red Sox Country, so until next time, I&#8217;m out!</p>
