								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During this process, one of the new terms I learned about was the term misogynoir as it was used in one of our interviews. The term refers to misogyny specifically against Black women, and usually refers to to misogyny against Black women at the hands of Black men. When talking about misogyny it is always important to acknowledge intersectionality, and take into account that not all women experience misogyny in the same way. There are a few Black women who were interviewed that talked about straight Black men on campus having a general disinterest in Black women and preferring white women over them. This is definitely an issue that is seen not only on Muhlenberg’s campus, but also through our country. Eurocentric ideals of beauty affect us in so many ways. I have seen this in the queer male community as well and this is something that has bothered me personally, and something I have seen in several interviews as well. Racial preferences are racist. You can’t say you’re not attracted to a certain race without being racist because then you’re assuming that all people of that race essentially look that same and that there’s not even a remote possibility that you could be attracted to someone of that race. So, freshmen, please keep an open mind.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Throughout the interview-reviewing process, I’ve noticed that the conversation about diversity at Muhlenberg often centers on critiques of Muhlenberg’s performance as a “progressive”, like-minded liberal arts institution. Commonly known amongst students and staff alike as “The Caring College,” the community at Muhlenberg has begun to acknowledge this performance of Niceness as its own school-specific type- “Muhlenberg Nice”- that paints the community at Muhlenberg as a happy, welcoming, accepting place for all, where the red doors are always held open for you and everyone Cares. After going through this first round of interviews, however, I’ve been asking myself, really- who do we, as a community at Muhlenberg, actually Care about? The statistics seem to speak differently than the perfectly painted picture of diversity that many at Muhlenberg would like to be true. White bodies, as well as predominantly cisgender and heterosexual identifying individuals, dominate the student body and faculty. This narrative of Niceness has been adopted by these privileged bodies in our community at Muhlenberg (the majoritarian identities). In Muhlenberg’s performance as Nice, the marginalized identities of the community are inherently silenced, as their struggles and experiences are seen as disturbances to the peaceful, kind, and Caring atmosphere of Muhlenberg’s campus. All too often, acknowledgments of systemic inequality are seen as an outside problem, not a Muhlenberg Problem- as if Muhlenberg is not a microcosm of the world, operating underneath the same power structures and abiding by the same hierarchies.</p>
<p>The Town Hall meeting in November of the past year is a clear and concise example of what I mean when I say that marginalized bodies are at risk of disrupting the harmony that persists around Muhlenberg Nice. In showing their solidarity with racial injustices at universities and colleges nationwide, students of color at Muhlenberg took to the popular, anonymous social media app, Yik Yak, to express their experiences at a predominantly white institution with the hashtags #Blackoncampus and #Latinxoncampus. This movement was met with harsh resistance on Yik Yak- a place where Muhlenberg Nice doesn&#8217;t have to exist, because of its anonymity. By addressing their own nuanced experiences of what it means to be a marginalized body in a majoritarian space, these students of color were met with direct, horrendous racist commentary from the surrounding community.</p>
<p>The sentiment that Muhlenberg exists in a vacuum, or what students attribute to the concept of the MuhlenBubble, does not exempt it from functioning under the same rules as the macro-level power structures surrounding it. It’s Nice to think of Muhlenberg as Caring, but I think it’s important to continue asking the questions- how much do we, at Muhlenberg, <em>really</em> Care? Is it enough that we hold the red door for everyone when it’s clear that “everyone” is a specific type of person, a tailored combination of identities?</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the first round of interviews my idea of what diversity is has definitely expanded. I can perceive diversity as being, not only different races, genders and sexualitites, but also different thoughts and ideologies. Furthermore, through interacting with the cast while also going through the interviews I have a new sense of knowledge about body ability/disability, as well as mental capacity. When having conversations about diversity and inclusion it’s important to note and acknowledge all elements of diversity, aka intersectionality. My first year was important for me in recognizing all facets of my identity that affect me being a student at Muhlenberg. Having a strong sense of self is also important in attempting to have a successful career at Muhlenberg, especially as a student of color. How these different aspects of my identity are supported and reflected on campus is another topic I’m still exploring, especially being a part of this cast. This journey is blossoming into a wonderful learning and growing experience.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After two intense rounds of sifting through the 70 (that&#8217;s right!!! 70!!!!!!) transcriptions we have gathered for this year&#8217;s project, the sediment has finally fallen away to reveal specs of gold. Today the ensemble spent twelve hours, 1pm-1am, narrowing down the passages that struck us the most. We then brought the words into the space with us by printing them out and spreading them around the first floor of MultiCulti. After weeks of hearing from every possible perspective, tonight we began the next phase by introducing all the different voices into conversation with each other.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I think as an Asian American on Muhlenberg’s campus the idea of privilege is a skewed topic to understand. Most of my time freshman year was spent with the idea that as a person within the “model minority,” I didn’t think my life had much overlap or relatability to warrant the need to say or speak out on the inequalities for students of color. I think this first week of listening to interviews has definitely helped me realize that indifference and detachment from these issues, inherently gives me privilege. I think a pivotal point in understanding how integration for marginalized communities on campus moves forward is by realizing not everyone has the privilege to not talk about these issues. While I realize that intrinsically the idea of pro-social justice seeking movements in general is not appealing to all types of individuals, and balancing how much time and effort one invests into such discussions is completely a personal choice, I would seriously advocate that everyone, no matter what path of life, see the importance of taking part and putting themself in an uncomfortable position, because as a result you will grow to be a better, more educated person. As a result I’m looking forward to sophomore year as a way for me to demonstrate how to be a better ally in the community, as well as help speak out for other students of color that may not necessarily fit into the black or white binary.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong>As we move into the next chapter of the Sedehi Diversity Project here are five of the most valuable things I have learned from SDP in my past two+ years interacting with the project.</strong> </em></p>
<p>This project has been the direct cause for so many of the decisions that I made within the past year of my life both personal and educationally. This project pushed me to explore the intersection where Anthropology and Theatre meet and explore how those disciplines, that are often thought to be polar opposites, meet to create something pretty powerful. This project has thought me the value of community engagement as well as the value in engaging in critical conversations about difference, power and privilege. This project has taught me so much already and as we head into this new year, here is a list of the five most valuable things I have learned while engaging with the Sedehi Diversity project in the past two years. Hopefully after I have finished directing the project, I will have even more things to add to this list, but for now I am pretty grateful for these five!</p>
<p><b><i>#1 The project acts as a reflection of who we are as a collective</i></b></p>
<p>The project reflects us as a community, but also acts as a mirror for the individual. It&#8217;s this sort of amazing phenomenon that happens in the project, through seeing yourself as a member of something bigger than yourself it can, and often does, bring you closer to understanding yourself.</p>
<p><b><i>#2</i></b> <b><i>SDP is highly invested in collaboration</i></b></p>
<p>The project highlights the importance of community and that when we link up as wellwishers and accomplices in the work of social equity, we gain power. With the current political climate, I think that this is one of the most important lessons the project can teach. You can never do enough social advocacy work but knowing that we have a network of intelligent, critical thinkers to help fight against the powers of inequity is so important.</p>
<p><b><i>#3</i></b> <b><i>Get into your heart and out of your head. </i></b></p>
<p>Through the work of the project, I think you really begin to understand that there may be a difference between how you are conditioned to think about situations of inequity and the logical way to view these situations. Through beginning to understanding that difference, you can begin to break down your own personal biases, no matter how explicit or implicit those feelings may be. Acknowledging your faults can lead to those thoughts manifesting into helpful, bridge-buidling connections.</p>
<p>SDP ’15 alum, Zoë Briggs, puts it nicely when she says, we are given a script that we are designed to follow and that is the conditioned first thought and the second thought, the thought that is descriped as the questioning thought, that is the thought that actually reflects how we are feeling. The project has certainly helped me develop a more nuanced understanding of bias, racism, and conditioned ways of being in our “worlds”.</p>
<p><b><i>#4 This project is designed to enact change and through hard work and determination those changes CAN be enacted. </i></b></p>
<p>Last year during Orientation weekend we saw President John Williams release a statement announcing that he was rescinding the existing Protest and Demonstration Policy! This was a policy that was put into place by previous President, Randy Helm and was widely disapproved of by many members in the campus community. This was such an exciting moment for the entire college! Being able to see that the voices of people on campus were being heard very clearly was so powerful!</p>
<p><b><i>#5 Humility is the key in seeing humanity. </i></b></p>
<p>This is so closely linked to the idea that through understanding our community we begin to develop a better understanding of ourselves. I think many of us in the ensemble last year had the same mentality: that we are all going to mess up, we are all going to say something racist or classist or ableist etc. and that being able to admit your faults and biases is the only true way to grow. Humility like this is what leads to seeing your <i>own</i> humanity as well as the humanity of <i>others</i>.</p>
<p>I look forward to seeing how my list of nuggets of knowledge that the project has blessed me with adapts and grows in the coming weeks! I look forward to the addition of more people into these important conversations.</p>
