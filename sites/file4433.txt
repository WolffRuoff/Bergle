He told workshop participants&#8211;which included students, faculty, and department alumni&#8211; that 90% of online community users are lurkers who never contribute, 9% of users contribute a little and 1% of users account for almost all of the action. And, of course, Justin urged <em>action</em>. Justin emphasized that today’s college students are primed for social networking because they grew up with technology, they live in a mobile society and they’re way ahead of older generations (who are busy catching up with the technology). And because students are already using all types of free social media, they can create a niche that will pay rewards.</p>
<p>To get started, Justin recommended doing what you love but doing it more publicly and then adding the web to the equation. He emphasized that branding yourself was important, as well as choosing an easy-to-remember name, being consistent, thinking ahead and getting your name out there. Justin also talked about his night job as one of the top New York City nightlife promoters. Using social networking to promote NYC nightlife and with his JustinRZB brand, he earns awards, cash and free passes to the city&#8217;s truly <strong>hot</strong> spots.  In the end, he challenged students to consider “Where do you fit in?”</p>
