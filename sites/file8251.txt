					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I found this blog post so interesting and accurate. While reading it, I thought of a friend of mine who is currently playing field hockey at UNC. At one point during her whole recruiting process, the recruiting coach called her and brought up some questions about her social media account. The coaching staff was able to access her &quot;private&quot; tweets and retweets and noticed that she had a lot of content containing curse words which is obviously a big red flag. In order to fix this problem, my friend had to go through her Twitter profile and delete any tweet and/or un-retweet any retweet containing any curse words. I find this story relevant because in your post you mentioned something about how teens are affected by social media during the college application process and this is just another example.&lt;/p&gt;
