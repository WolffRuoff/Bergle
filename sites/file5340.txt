								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In our determination to finish going through all of the transcriptions, the majority of the cast stayed up until 3AM!  I applaud us for sticking through and working hard.  I will say that some of us reached that point of being slap happy.  And in the middle of rehearsal we it was decided that some of us needed a dance break&#8230;.</p>
<div id="attachment_136" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://sedehidiversityproject.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/08/20130806_231151.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-136" class="size-medium wp-image-136" alt="Emeley, Kittrell, Ben, Kyra, Mel, and Will Kellog take a dance break led by our project manager Will Raynor" src="http://sedehidiversityproject.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/08/20130806_231151-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" srcset="http://sedehidiversityproject.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/08/20130806_231151-300x225.jpg 300w, http://sedehidiversityproject.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/08/20130806_231151-1024x768.jpg 1024w, http://sedehidiversityproject.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/08/20130806_231151-624x467.jpg 624w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-136" class="wp-caption-text">Emeley, Kittrell, Ben, Kyra, Mel, and Will Kellog take a dance break led by our project manager Will Raynor</p></div>
<p>Now Vernon, Ben, and myself stayed up &#8217;til 8am that previous night/morning? and only received about 4-6 hours asleep.  I was particularly impressed with myself.  I didn&#8217;t wake up until 12:50! That&#8217;s so late for me and I felt so unproductive!  Unfortunately it looks like another late night&#8230;</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ben did a great job giving a brief overview of what we&#8217;ve been working on and what&#8217;s to come in terms of SDP.  I want to go a little bit further in this post and talk a bit about why the Project is structured the way it is.</p>
<p>The Sedehi Diversity Project is a student-created, student-led piece of documentary theatre.  What that essentially means is that in addition to performing the piece, Ensemble members are involved in every aspect of it&#8217;s creation, from interviews to script building to blocking.  And even though I&#8217;m the director per say, there&#8217;s a more collective view of the process in which we work together to envision and produce this piece of theatre.</p>
<p>Documentary theatre is also inherently unique.  All of the material from our script is born out of things that were said by the Muhlenberg community.  Every single line.  How we acquire these perspectives is by going out and doing interviews (over 50 this year) and then transcribing them from audio to text (if you thought that sounds time consuming, it is haha).  This is so important because this script is completely personalized to Muhlenberg campus; it&#8217;s not just a generalized play about diversity.  It reflects the attitudes and climate of the campus community in the year that the play was produced.  Having been in the project last year, I can already sense the ways in which the tenor of this year&#8217;s play will be different.</p>
<p>So we interview and transcribe, interview and transcribe.  We are now at the point where we are taking all of that material and putting it in conversation with one another.  This involves going through well over a hundred pages of potential script.  Our goal, once again, is to reflect the conversations that are occurring on campus, right now.  This is not just another play about getting along in spite of our differences.  This becomes a discussion of real discourse about diversity, both the good and the bad.  It is a call to action.</p>
<p>Once our script is produced, we will move from the rehearsal house and into the black box, where the piece is performed, to become acquainted with the space.  As it is not required to be involved in theatre to be in this play, some Ensemble members really explored that space before.  With the exception of myself and our wonderful Project Manager Will, the Ensemble will become embodiments of our community, delivering the perspectives of many different community members, many different bodies.</p>
<p>SDP is one of the most exciting projects that I&#8217;ve ever been involved in, and one of the most unique.  I don&#8217;t want to speak for the entire Ensemble (so you guys correct me if I&#8217;m wrong haha), but it has already affected all of us, allowed us to express our own perspectives while also challenging certain ideas that we held.  We hope it will do the same for all those who come to see it.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello all! I thought that it would benefit y&#8217;all to know what exactly we&#8217;re up to over here at &#8216;Berg. So! Here&#8217;s how it works.</p>
<p><strong>Interviews</strong></p>
<p>We begin by interviewing members of the Muhlenberg community. This includes students, faculty members, working staff, administration, and anyone else we can find. All the ensemble members sit down and interview this person, which usually lasts anywhere from 20 minutes to an hour and 20 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>Transcriptions</strong></p>
<p>One of the ensemble members is assigned the interview to transcribe. This usually takes muuuuuch longer than the actual interview. I made the hilarious-in-retrospect-but-not-at-the-time mistake of transcribing my <em>entire</em> first interview, including stupid jokes, laughter, and a laundry buzzer.</p>
<p><strong>Review</strong></p>
<p>Every weeknight, we all gather in the Rehearsal House to go over whatever transcriptions we have. We project them onto a screen and go through them line by line, agreeing and disagreeing on what we think should go into the final script. This is where we currently are in the process.</p>
<p><strong>Scriptbuilding</strong></p>
<p>Soon, we&#8217;ll take all of the lines we like and hash them into a proto-script. Then we&#8217;ll cut it, cut it some more, continue to cut it, do some more removal of lines, cut it a final time, and have a script.</p>
<p><strong>Theater Things</strong></p>
<p>After that we&#8217;ll divide up lines, memorize them, block the show, and then it&#8217;s performance time!</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s how it goes. Can&#8217;t wait to see you all!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wednesday, July 31st &#8212; Day 3</p>
<p>Oh what a night!</p>
<p>It starts with us attempting to navigate our way through Allentown towards <em>Spice India</em>, a relatively local and authentic Indian restaurant. Ultimately the lesson from that experience was: how many college students does it take to read a GPS? Far too many.</p>
<p>Once at the restaurant we enjoyed some delicious Indian cuisine but the real fun came when the check arrived. The first time we attempted to split the check we didn&#8217;t obtain enough money (around $30 under), the second attempt resulted in far too much money in the pile (around $15 over), the third time was the charm luckily&#8230;.but pathetically. The whole ordeal took about 15 minutes or so and you would think with two math majors in the group we would have been more successful. Lesson from that experience: Next time, split the check.</p>
<p>Rehearsal was by large a success as we went through seven transcripts. By this I mean we went through the transcriptions of seven interviews and chose/debated over what transcribed portions we wanted in the script and took out the parts we did not.</p>
<p>Although I was surprised about the general lack of heated debates over keeping some of them, I have feeling that this is only the beginning and I am actually looking forward to these arguments. Great, constructive arguments can only lead to a better product and I am so excited to see what we have by the end of all of this.</p>
