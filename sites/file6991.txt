								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>An overview of child maltreatment:</strong> This week in class we discussed child maltreatment, including abuse and neglect. The Center for Disease Control (CDC) defines child abuse and neglect as “any act or series of acts of commission or omission by a parent or other caregiver (e.g., clergy, coach, teacher) that results in harm, potential for harm, or threat of harm to a child.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Acts of Commission (Abuse):</strong> The CDC defines acts of abuse as “words or overt actions that cause harm, potential harm, or threat of harm. Acts of commission are deliberate and intentional.” It is important to note the wording of this definition. In regard to <em>intention</em>: intention only applies to the actions of the caregiver, and not the consequences of the actions. For example: a parent hits a child as a form of punishment (the action of hitting is <em>intentional</em> and not accidental), but the hitting is not intended to cause the child to have a black eye.</p>
<p><strong>Types of Abuse: </strong></p>
<p>Physical Abuse– e.g., hitting, punching</p>
<p>Sexual Abuse– e.g., inappropriate touching, groping, non-consensual sexual actions</p>
<p>Psychological Abuse– e.g., abuse that can cause emotional harm, such as verbal threats</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Acts of Omission (Neglect):</strong> The CDC defines child neglect as the “failure to provide needs or to protect from harm or potential harm.” Similar to acts of commission, actual harm to the child may not be the intended consequence.</p>
<p><strong>Types of Neglect: </strong></p>
<p><strong>Failure to Provide:</strong></p>
<p>Physical Neglect – e.g., not giving the child enough food, appropriate clothing</p>
<p>Emotional Neglect – e.g., not providing the child with adequate love, attention, and affection</p>
<p>Medical/ Dental Neglect – e.g., failure to bring the child to the doctor when sick, not bringing the child in for regular shots or check-ups</p>
<p>Educational Neglect – e.g., not providing necessary tools to complete school work such as pencils, preventing child from attending school</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Failure to Supervise:</strong></p>
<p>Inadequate Supervision – e.g., leaving a child alone in a hot car, leaving a child alone for too long</p>
<p>Exposure to Violent Environments – e.g., child is privy to domestic violence, organized crime</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In 2016, there were 676,000 victims of child abuse and neglected that were <em>reported </em>to Child Protective Services (CPS)</li>
<li>80% of the perpetrators of the abuse were parents</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How you can help:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Mandated Reporters: individuals, by law, that must report any <em>suspicion</em> of child abuse/neglect to CPS. A mandated reporter is any individual that provides care to a child. Mandated Reporter Laws vary from state to state (see link below).</li>
<li>Even if you are not a mandated reporter, it is important to report any suspicion of potential child abuse/neglect. Remember, when you report something, you are not responsible for investigating the case, therefore, the responsibility leaves your hands once you make a report.</li>
<li>Call <strong>911</strong> if you believe the child is in immediate danger.</li>
<li>For non-emergency situations, call the Child Abuse Hotline, ChildLine at: <strong>1-800-932-0313</strong></li>
</ul>
