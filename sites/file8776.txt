								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With AirBNB&#8217;s expansive networking of users, ease of usage, and appeal of modern day traveling, it is easier now than ever to truly find a home away from home. For those that are unfamiliar with the estimated $20 billion valued company, Airbnb offers easy renting for guests that are looking for anything from single rooms and apartments to castles and tree houses. The company&#8217;s booming and unique platform of connecting hosts and travelers without owning any room itself has driven it so such success.</span></p>
<p>With the company&#8217;s unique advertising of having guests stay in real homes of others they try to optimize safety and transparency. Technology today makes us feel like we can market ourselves to appear a certain way but still hold onto a sense of security and privacy. Airbnb requires that all guests provide a valid ID as well as all hosts with videotaping equipment explicitly say so in their listing. Precautions such as these make it so guests and users alike can display a fake persona or invade a guest&#8217;s privacy. Hosts may also use the apps new messaging feature to converse with interested guests to determine if they want to accept the person&#8217;s offer. With features like this technology provides ways for people to communicate while forcing them to be transparent.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">All though certain rules such as these are put into place there are also defaults in the system. Reports of vandalism of houses with extreme damages have occurred as well as people&#8217;s rooms being put up for rent without their knowledge. Despite the Airbnb&#8217;s ability to cut out any middleman in the process of booking between host and guest there are still gaps and miscommunication that come when using technology to communicate. Just because the network has made it easier to access one another doesn’t mean we always are who we say we are behind a screen. Airbnb has the ability to make it possible to not even have to face the person that is renting your space. The chatting and messenger feature can also be harmful in that people get tricked into knowing the person behind the screen when in fact that is not the case.</span></p>
