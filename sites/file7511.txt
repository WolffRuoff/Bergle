								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It was a pleasure to have Jim Groom come talk to us this past Thursday. Although we have already discussed online privacy in great detail, I enjoyed having another perspective on the issue. He showed us a video entitled “Scary Pizza” in which a man calls a pizza place and the system contains massive amounts of personal information. This video was created in 2004, and although this is not really the way a typical phone call proceeds even nowadays, it is scary that this is very possible in the future. In my previous posts, I have touched upon the evolving definition of online privacy. The Scary Pizza video makes me think of the way that privacy offline is also changing. Since Internet users are so accustomed to sharing information online, why aren’t people the same way in person? Audrey Watters states, “[information] shared in public, none of this is <i>public</i> in terms of ownership,” meaning that nothing online is really private (Watters, 2016). If as a society we are going to embrace the technology revolution, we need to keep the definition of privacy consistent across mediums and in everyday life. For instance, people like to selective with what they reveal in person versus online. I have had experiences where I ask someone where they are going to only find that they lied to me because of pictures on their Snapchat. If people are as honest in person as they are online, maybe we can become a more well-connected society. However, we all need to set guidelines and boundaries for ourselves online so that we don’t appear to have multiple personalities online. Personally, I strive to a little less personal online than in person, because I feel that confrontation is more successful face to face. So, I suggest that you assess the information you put online and whether that is in line with your definition of privacy. Just like Jim Groom says, take control of what you put online and how you are perceived by other Internet users.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ownership. As Watters highlights in her article we have moved further away from ownership. We have little control of what we own and control, especially in an increasingly online and digital world.</p>
<p>This post will challenge you in 3 ways:</p>
<p>Respond to this question: How can something like &#8216;Domain of One&#8217;s Own&#8217; aid students in taking ownership of one&#8217;s own writing and developing one&#8217;s writing process?</p>
<p>Respond to this question: Students take classes. Faculty frame what will be learned in those classes. How does one ultimately take ownership of one&#8217;s own learning and education?</p>
<p>Generate your own questions: based on the reading(s) and online discussions, generate your own questions and respond to each others&#8217; questions as appropriate.</p>
<p>You do not need to respond to each and every question presented above or through the comments from the class, but respond to the questions that have meaning to you, or that will help deepen your understanding of the reading/topic, or where you have insight you want to share about ownership, digital identity, a domain of one&#8217;s own, etc. Do not just answer questions for the sake of answering questions, but to engage more deeply in this online discussion.</p>
