								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Think about how many times a day you read. From the moment you wake up, you are reading everything from street signs to text messages, from newspapers to billboards. People constantly complain about having to read, despite the fact that reading is extremely crucial to our existence. If no one was able to read, it would be very hard to function in society. Mike Hanksi informs us just how important reading is in his article <i>Want to Be a Better Writer? Read More.</i> Within his opening he states,“Reading is fashionable. Again. It’s cool. We bet you can all find many statements about how good and useful reading is, how much it can influence a person and his way of thinking… ” (Hanski, 2014).</p>
<p>If someone explained to you exactly how to be a great writer, would you listen? If they laid everything out, would you follow through? Hanski does just this. He depicts the sole way to becoming a successful writer is by reading. By doing this, one will become more educated and discover inspiration. Ideas obtained through reading will only increase your ability when writing. Reading can make your brain function stronger; it exercises your mind and circulates blood flow to the brain. From there it continues with reducing the likelihood of contracting Alzheimer’s disease and even makes a person more sympathetic. The benefits of reading are endless, so why would one not take that chance and run with it. It’s a no brainer to utilize reading as a tool to just make your writing exceptional and to improve your quality of life.  Mike quotes famous author Stephen King,“ If you don’t have the time to read, you don’t have the time (or the tools) to write. Simple as that” (Hanski, 2014). Even a well renowned, published author agrees with Hanski that reading is quite an essential aspect of being a great writer.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Reading and writing are essential to everyday living. If you knew that just sitting down and reading a book would help with over coming things like stress or decreasing your chances of having Alzheimer’s disease, would you do it then? According to scientists, reading helps strengthen your brain and increase the blood flow which is beneficial. But if you’re able to sit down and read something that you are interested in then why not just read? If you are stressed out, read. Getting older or contracting Alzheimer’s disease could be helped just by picking up a book or reading the news paper. Its not proven that it will cure those things, but if it helps why no try it. Many people say they don&#8217;t have the time to read or they just don&#8217;t like to read, but why not just try it for twenty minuets; it is a way to escape the world for a little bit and learn new things. Hanski seems to think that reading is what shapes us. He also thinks it helps us with understanding our feelings, figuring out who we are and opening us up to all new things.</p>
<p>School is something that we all do not get excited about, but our teachers give us massive reading assessments that is helping us in the long run; however, the readings they give us are usually the cause of our stress. So maybe taking a step back from that reading assignment and clearing are minds and then getting back to it will help. No matter what, we have to read it but it makes a difference what attitude that you have towards the reading. If it is something you don&#8217;t want to do, then you are not going to be interested and get stressed out but if you look at it in a positive way then it might not be as bad. We go to school so that we can get a good education and get a good job to live a happy life well, to do all that we need to know how to read and write. So when looking at homework or a book that we don&#8217;t want to read, we are helping our brains out and making them stronger so that we can live out the lives that we all think about living.</p>
<p>Hanski wrote about one issue in his article and that was if you can’t read you are not going to fit in to a social environment. Everyone needs to read; You might not be the best reader out there but you still need to be able to read so you can complete everyday tasks. But reading could easily help you be successful in life. Mostly any job you get you will need to be able to read and write. Reading and writing is not only important for a job but also in who you become. “It helps us understand all feelings and events, it makes us better, it teaches us to respect people, it broadens our minds, and it opens out hearts to everything new.” (Mike Hanski, page 3) Hanski’s article makes you realize that reading is truly important and essential to our life. Without reading and writing we all might not be the bright people that we are today.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left">     Mike Hanski&#8217;s article titled &#8220;Want to be a Better Writer? Read More.&#8221; discusses the importance of how reading can benefit numerous aspects of the self. Some of his major points included that reading influences your writing, influences your study, and most importantly in my opinion, increases your vocabulary. Having a well-built vocabulary is not only beneficial for your writing and for school, but for everyday life. After college when it comes time to apply and interview for jobs it is valuable to have an understanding of complex concepts and be able to converse intelligently as you get older. Hanski states that &#8220;reading widens a vocabulary, broadens a kid&#8217;s mind, and helps him understand the world better&#8221; (p.2). These are tools that are beneficial for a lifetime.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">     When I am reading and come across a word that seems unfamiliar, taking a few minutes to research the definition always makes a huge difference in my understanding of the reading. Additionally, I am learning new terms that I hopefully will be able to apply and make new ideas out of in future writings. As I build my vocabulary, I find that the quality of my writing increases, in addition to my overall performance in school. This is not only a huge confidence booster, but it encourages me to read more. I find that I feel most motivated to read when it is on a topic that I am interested in. I enjoy reading for pleasure beyond the reading that is assigned in class because it helps me to find where my interests are. Reading newspapers and non-fiction stories allow you to learn about the world which is so important to be knowledgable about. Today, with access to such a vast amount of portable technology such as Kindles, iPads, and iPhones, access to reading material has become easier than ever. In conclusion, if I didn&#8217;t read as much as I do, I would find myself struggling when it comes time to write papers and have to apply my knowledge into real world activities.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">       When first starting to read Mike Hanski’s article, the first thing the reader sees is the title in big bold letters, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Want to Be a Better Writer? Read more</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">. Hanski’s persuasion is in full effect in the title. Throughout the article, he lists many different ways that reading can help boost the mind including bringing inspiration, gaining knowledge, and widening vocabulary. Reading gives people an upper edge not just in writing which it does improve greatly but in overall knowledge that you are able to bring to the table in all situations. Knowing more information in various topics will help you be able to engage with many different people from very different backgrounds. Reading more would be beneficial to anyone willing to put in the work. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">        As I first started reading Hanski’s article, I immediately was lured in by his title. I label myself as someone who just reads what he is assigned and does not do any reading for leisure aside from breaking news on my twitter feed and many different types of articles. Who does not want to become a better writer? I clearly do not read enough and this article persuaded me to start reading more than what I am just assigned in school. The influences of reading by itself told me that I should and have to read more. Overcoming stress, keeping the brain in shape while getting older, and broadening of my imagination. Going to a school where writing is very important puts a large emphasis on this article. I need to be a better writer in order to succeed and if I think I am good enough to stop improving, even Stephen King one of the most famous and best selling authors ever credits reading to his writing abilities. “If you don’t have time to read, you don&#8217;t have the time (or the tools) to write. Simple as that,” (P.1) Even Stephen King, a writer with as much ability as he has, reads more to gain inspiration and assist with his writing. Reading is so special because it can help us with so many things and not just writing. Although people may not want to read because it is not convenient or takes up too much time, the benefits are endless and absolutely worth the time it takes. </span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Reading, often viewed as a dreadful act by students, is much more than just a means of getting individuals to remember the information being presented. As Mike Hanski writes in a piece for the <em>Huffington Post</em>, reading plays a pivotal role in molding the type of writer a person becomes. According to Hanski (2014, p. 1), writing is not a skill that can simply be attained by the memorization of grammatical rules, punctuation marks, and various writing styles. Rather, one becomes a phenomenal writer by reading. Studies have shown that reading produces a source of inspiration for many, leads to increased knowledge, prepares children for school, enables writers to understand their readers, and does much more. Additionally, reading “makes our lives easier” in the long run (Hanski, 2014, p. 3). Hanski (2014, p.3) notes that reading is responsible for broadening our minds, opening our hearts to new things, and teaching us to respect others.</p>
<p>In the grand scheme of things, reading is not so bad. The path to communicating with others effectively starts with reading “as it connects [people] to the rest of the whole world” (Hanski, 2014, p. 2). Communication can be considered more crucial in today’s society than it has ever been before. With so many different communication platforms around, one is constantly expected to be able to convey his/her thoughts. However, several means of modern communication would not be possible without writing. Take email and social media sites such as Twitter and Facebook as prime examples. As people communicate via email, Twitter, and Facebook, they write down their thoughts electronically. While much of what is posted to Twitter and Facebook is written informally by misinformed people, there are instances when individuals make valid points. These points are typically well-thought-out and well-written. This type of writing, as Hanski (2014, p.1) points out, would not be possible without people first making the effort to read about their topic of discussion.</p>
<p>If everyone decided that reading was futile, people would constantly be uninformed about prevalent issues. Moreover, communication between friends, family, high-level business executives, teachers, students, and even the president of the United States and the general public could not exist, as it does today, without individuals first taking the time to read. Just as Hanski (2014, p. 2) writes, one should take the time to read something that he/she enjoys. A person will ultimately find that he/she is not only better equipped to discuss what has been read, but to write about it as well.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hanski demonstrates that reading and writing are both necessary for the development of each other. It is not possible for either reading or writing to stand alone in each one’s own separate world. They are harmonious entities that build off one another to promote the power of knowledge and the discussion of morality. Every book has meaning and a message for an intended audience because, “every author writes for readers” (Hanski, 2014, p. 2). According to Hanski (2014), “Everything you learn as a reader, you can use as a writer afterward” (p. 2). The vocabulary and imagination that come with reading allow young minds to unconsciously think about writing. Writers are storytellers. They introduce new worlds and use society as a stepping ground to formulate social opinions and spread word of their ideologies. Readers are crucial to the survival of writers because there is not one without the other.</p>
<p>Reading and writing also effect our perceptions of the world and promote morality and development among all ages of readers. Hanski (2014) states that, “reading helps kids define who they are, as it connects them to the rest of the world” (p. 2). Reading provides knowledge of not only the world, but also of the self. With knowledge comes power, and for children to feel that power at an early age will lead them into a strong and morally conscious future. Reading provokes passion and imagination, essential for a successful life of education and learning. Literacy rates prove that, “poor reading skills can lead to a person’s social exclusion” (Hanski, 2014, p. 2). Those who are literate have a universal understanding of mankind, as compared to those who are illiterate. Illiteracy during high school has proven to result in unemployment, “most likely…by the age of 30” (Hanski, 2014, p. 2). This statistic demonstrates how crucial the incorporation of reading into one’s education is for the development of the mind and one’s advancement in writing skill.</p>
<p>Hanski’s use of transition words significantly emphasize his point pertaining to the positive effect of reading on one’s writing skill. His repetitious nature further promotes the impact of his thesis, specifically when he uses the words, “becoming”, “influences”, “impact”, “expand”, “improving”, (Hanski, 2014, p. 2) and so on. These words shine a literary spotlight on the importance of reading and writing, for they help develop his cause and help the reader understand that reading is a process that only gets better with time. Writing is not a skill that can be mastered overnight. Writing is a complex system that utilizes reading as its base and builds upon that base with experience. A person can never read too many books because reading and writing constantly change, developing as people get older and developing in itself as the literary world evolves.</p>
