								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Facebook is just another one of the countless forms of social media that my generation uses to see what their “friends” are doing. One’s news feed is the endless list that updates itself as people upload new content. These news feeds encompass status updates, pictures, and even articles that people like and share. The problem with Facebook occurs when users accept friend requests from people they don&#8217;t actually know. Now these strangers have access to not only personal pictures, but personal information.</p>
<p>Robert Lemieux, a professor in the communication department at McDaniel College, conducted a study about privacy on Facebook. His participants had to construct a fictitious profile with the name Jamie Marple and a profile picture showing both a girl and a boy. The name Jamie was chosen because of the possibility that it could fit either gender. The only other information on the profile aside from the name and the extremely vague picture, was “Jamie’s” date of birth and hometown. “Since the study’s primary interest was to test the likelihood of being accepted as a friend based on limited, personal information, Jamie’s personal information was severely limited” (Lemieux, 2012). Another group of participants within the study were informed to friend Jamie and write on her profile. This made it look like Jamie was real and active user.</p>
<p>The entire purpose of Lemieux’s study was to see if people would accept a friend request from a person with a questionable profile that they really did not know. The results proved that kids are willing to accept friend requests from even the profiles that have meager amounts of information. “Results indicated that 325 Facebook members (72% of the sample) willingly accepted the friendship of the unknown individual” (Lemieux, 2012). More than 50% of Facebook users were willing to welcome a new friendship despite knowing such a minute amount of information about them.</p>
<p>What’s the issue with this? Why is it so bad to casually accept a friend request on Facebook? You see that you have some mutual friends with this persons so it must not be a big deal. Many problems however could come along with the spontaneous action of accepting anyone and everyone. Not only is your privacy in jeopardy, but your security is too. Once accepting that friend request, the person on the other side of the computer has access to very personal information like where you live or where you go to school. They can also see pictures that you post, and pictures other people post of you. One day someone unwanted could find out where you live or the wrong person could see you at a party holding a beer. Would you want that?</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the ever evolving world today, teens have become so accustomed to the presence and use of technology in their day to day lives. With the existence of technology, comes the ever-growing want and need of two top priorities: to be connected to friends, family, and strangers around the world and to have one’s privacy remain intact while doing so. In July 2011, the wants and needs of the aforementioned teens came true via the release of Snapchat. The app was created by Evan Spiegel, Bobby Murphy, and Reggie Brown as a requirement for a course at Stanford University (“Snapchat,” 2015).  The app’s platform encourages users to send candid pictures of whatever it is that they are doing in that moment. The unsaved photos are then sent to user’s friends and are deleted after a maximum of ten seconds which is set by the sender. Although this form of social media sounds utopic, are teens relying so heavily on the assumption that the pictures are deleted forever that they let their guard down? The answer is yes.</p>
<p>An increased sense of privacy is typically accompanied by an increased sense of indestructibility. Within the four years that Snapchat has been up and running, sexting has become overwhelmingly popular because users believe that once the content disappears after the time limit expires, it is gone forever (“Snapchat,” 2015). Contrary to popular belief, Snapchat’s main privacy page states that “there may be ways to access messages while still in temporary storage on recipients’ devices or, forensically, even after they are deleted (“Privacy Policy,” 2014).” Therefore, users of Snapchat are being deceived by themselves. By not knowing the full parameters of the app, one is acting in ways that they would not if they did not believe the app was private. The fact that this not-really-private-privacy is not hidden but rather in regular sized text on the main webpage of Snapchat, shows that teens are not looking carefully at what they are agreeing to when signing up for an account. Consequently, I believe that teens today allow themselves to get into the trouble that they are getting in because they are too quick to believe what they want to be true.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bullying has always been an issue but with technology and social media being so essential to our lives its become easy for people to bully other people online. With every social media its easy to bully someone. It is not hard to make a fake account or just message a person or even comment on peoples post. It makes it even easier due to the fact that you don’t even see the person’s reaction. But now you are on social media that is specifically for posting pictures, and you might think how could you bully someone over Instagram.</p>
<p>When I first got an Instagram I put my self on private just because I did not want random people following but I would have never thought about someone bullying on Instagram. Way too many people can see what you comment. It is not like Facebook where you might not stop and look at everyone’s post and comment. But for Instagram you purposely go on it to look at the pictures and what their captions are and you usually read the comments.  So why would any one want to even do anything mean on Instagram or any social media, it will always be brought back up. I’ve never seen any one being bullied on Instagram but I have heard of it happening.</p>
<p>When I found Cyberbullying Research Center’s blog post on Instagram and bullying I couldn’t believe all the ways you could bully someone on Instagram. They listed five different ways to bully someone and then told some people’s stories. I don’t understand why anyone would want to bully anyone but since it does happen, the big question is what do we do?</p>
<p>I see so many different adds and campaigns to stop bullying but it still seems to be going on. I truly do believe that more people need to start standing up to bullies, if you see someone getting bullied over social media then say something once one person does it I’m sure more will follow. To the person who gets bullied you might have made it better for them to see someone standing up for them. In the blog post a twelve-year-old girl posted a picture and got mean comments on it for no reason, but then that also starts the conversation of a twelve-year-old girl shouldn’t be on Instagram. At some point there should be an age limit on how old you can be to be on any social media. Someone that young shouldn’t experience hate like that. Even as a thirteen-year-old they shouldn’t have to be dealing with social media like that. Yes, it happens at any age but an 18-year-old might be able to handle a situation a little bit better then a twelve or thirteen-year-old. Cyber Bulling is a major issue in our world today and we all need to take steps to help prevent it because one day our own kids will have to be dealing with this. So trying to make social media a better place will help the future kids.</p>
