								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Social media as we know it has become so widely accessible and weaved into every aspect of our lives that tit has given our generation a name of digital natives. From Twitter to Instagram and all social media platforms in-between, technology today has the ability to satisfy our need for human connection. Whether it be by seeing updated photos of events or phrases of our night being limited to a tweet, it is hard to  escape knowing peoples whereabouts. One of the many dangers of this though is the increasing  amount of platforms to bully and hurt people on. Numerous social media apps gain fame and net worth through their fan bases but their initial  start up point is in investors willing to put money towards their ideas. Yik Yak was able to be valued at almost $300 million because of its investors believed in the app&#8217;s ability to  create &#8220;hyper local forums [providing] a sense of community  and a place to be our genuine selves&#8221;. The consequences though are threats and demeaning comments that are becoming increasingly more prevalent even as the apps owners try to control exactly what is allowed on the platform. Author William D. Cohan of  the article &#8220;In the Rise of Yik Yak App, Profits and Ethics Collide&#8221;, he brings up the question if the initial investors should be held responsible for these actions. Whether of not theses investors foresaw the possible down sides of this app or not comes into question and we must consider if introducing new technology in general should be monitored more closely in order to provide a safe environment for the use of these tools. In the new age of digital natives it is arguable that no generation has had more access to being connected to one another than any before. Social media platforms have the ability to connect people from within one and half miles of each other, such as in Yik Yak, to across the globe with apps like Instagram or Twitter.</p>
