					<description><![CDATA[Great link, Group 2!  So few groups actually write about the authority power role in their blog posts, so it is nice to see how this power role works to either enable or constrain the activities of a major corporation like Siruis/XM.  Just like the FCC and the FTC (Federal Trade Commission) in the United States, governmental bodies like the CRTC must satisfy themselves that a large merger of this sort is in the public interest.  Good analysis here as well.]]></description>
