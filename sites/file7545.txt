								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From what I can remember, I first used technology at three years old. I remember watching Teletubbies over and over again. Around four, my parents got me a desktop computer. I used to spend hours playing educational games and always wanting more. I had a Gameboy Advanced where I’d play Super Mario Brothers 2 and get mad at me not being able to finish levels. I once got so mad I, no joke, bit the screen and thus breaking it. After making the transition to kindergarten, I began to watch more TV and do more on the computer. All my friends were talking about that newest Spongebob episode, but I, oddly enough, was not allowed to watch it. To this day, I still haven’t seen one full episode of the show. As I got further into grade school, it was the coolest thing to have a cell phone and a DS. I remember begging my mom to get me a cell phone but she did get me a DS though. I continued to use my computer and watch TV while everyone else seemed cooler because of that phone. In the computer lab at our school, we began to learn to use the computer better on this <em>Learning.com</em> website. I don’t remember the exact site because that was grade school. It was a fun activity because it was interactive and it gave us a sense of accomplishment when we finished it. There were word games, typing puzzles, Excel, Word, and PowerPoint were some of the things I remember doing. When sixth grade rolled around, those skills were put to the test in our first research project The night I finished sixth grade, my parents took me and my sister out to hibachi, the Japanese place where they make the food in front of you. At the conclusion of dinner and desert, my mom handed me a gift. I remember thinking to myself “What’s this for?” before blurting it out my mouth. She just told me to open it. Doing as she instructed, I unwrapped a new phone. I was so happy that this wish of mine came true. I don’t remember what it was but I loved it. It had a slide out keyboard and I could load games onto it. I ended up dropping it half way through seventh grade and my parents upgraded me to a Pantech Laser with the same slide out keyboard. That got me to High School. In eighth grade, specifically on my sister’s birthday, we both got a box. We opened them to find paper iPhones. My sister and I were so confused. We ended up each getting an iPhone 4 while my parents got the 4s. In 9<sup>th</sup> grade, I remember playing it in class. I got caught one too many times and I got my apps taken off for good. I was so distressed. In 10<sup>th</sup> grade, I began watching YouTube videos through Safari on cellular data at lunch. I used my data so fast I really needed to tone it down. After I got Safari taken away, I just stopped really using the phone until iOS 7 came around. iTunes Radio got me through the 45-minute, 6:20am bus ride to school and the 2:12pm, 30-minute bus ride back still using data. My parents upgraded to a shared 10GB plan; I still used 75% of the total data every month. I got an Instagram account but deleted it soon after because I really didn’t have much to do on it. Then, earlier this year, my parents decided to take us on a “family trip” that my sister and I were not given any information about. They ended up getting us the iPhone 6s. A few months ago, my grandmother offered to get me a computer for use at school. This turned into the mac that I use. I had used a Mac since 2009 when my mom got a MacBook pro. It seemed easier to use and paired well with our iPhones. This completes my technology timeline for now as the future holds a great many secrets ready to be uncovered.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since technology has always been a part of my life, I have never stopped to reflect on the impact it has had on my life. Although I am not sure if the implications are positive or negative, I know I would not have the same interests today if technology wasn’t a player.</p>
<p>My earliest memories of technology are playing with my Leapster and reading from my LeapPad. The Leapster was an educational gaming system, on which I remember playing a dog game. The player would have to take care of the dogs by doing math problems. As a math major, I see that this could be where my love for math roots from. The LeapPad was a device that you could attach books to, and it would read them to you and have activities about the book at the end. I now understand why I liked my LeapPad so much—I am an auditory learner, and often listen to audiobooks.</p>
<p>Like many other children, I loved watching TV. My favorite show growing up was <i>Blues Clues</i>, where a dog named Blue would leave clues that would help solve a mystery by the end of the program. I enjoyed the variety of characters and the bright colors used to design them. I also loved to watch princess movies. I would go to the library to take out the VHS of <i>Belle’s Tales of Friendship</i>, watch it everyday, and return it by the three day deadline, just to take it out again the next day.</p>
<p>Years later, I got a phone after my sixth grade graduation, and I find this to be a pivotal point in my technological life since it was my first gateway to communication through technology. It was a Samsung Intensity, which had a slide-out keyboard. I thought having a phone like this would make me &#8220;cool&#8221; amongst my peers, since many of them already had phones. However, I found that the hype was much greater than the actual experience; I did not text people often nor did the phone have Internet capabilities. Yet I found that having a phone provided a false sense of comfort, which I still believe hold today.</p>
<p>It would be four years until I had an iPhone. I got the iPhone 5c (in blue) and I found that it changed my life it many different ways. I had Internet access on the family computer at home, but now i had the Internet in my pocket. My parents put restrictions on my phone, but I had still upgraded from my slide phone. I did not have any social media accounts until I turned 18, but I always watched YouTube. I have always been entertained by a variety of content creators, including comedians, vloggers (video bloggers), dancers, and gymnasts. Watching YouTube often has shifted my time management, and has probably affected my sleep patterns. However, I would never stop watching YouTube because this is where I find creative inspiration.</p>
<p>When I turned 18, I finally logged onto Facebook and Instagram, with intentions of using it to find Muhlenberg students. As expected, it has become much more than that. Now in college, I find that Facebook is one of the best ways to connect with my friends &amp; family. I make sure to also post lots of pictures so others can feel the same sense of connection.</p>
<p>My parents gifted me with a MacBook for college, and I mainly use it to read online articles for coursework and type on the Pages application. Another tool I use is Wolfram Alpha, which is a scholarly form of Google. According to our Technology Survey, I am the only person that answered that I use it (Hertel, 2016). I love Wolfram Alpha, and it is especially useful for math, because sometimes it is hard to get math help on Google. I can imagine that there are apps or websites that I am aware of that are just as useful as Wolfram Alpha that I can someday bring into my technological tool belt.</p>
