<p>Club members had a chance to ask Altitude professionals about best practices and career advice.  Rachel Albert, president of the club, described the visit as &#8220;extremely informative.&#8221;  &#8220;We really appreciated the experience to talk one-on-one with professionals.  It was especially great to learn more about careers in public relations and communications, and see how an agency runs on a daily basis.&#8221;</p>
<p>See the agency&#8217;s <a href="http://www.altitudemarketing.com/altitude-marketing-news/altitude-hosts-muhlenberg-college-communications-club-for-agency-tour/">press release</a> <a title="Media Com Club visits Altitude Marketing" href="http://www.altitudemarketing.com/altitude-marketing-news/altitude-hosts-muhlenberg-college-communications-club-for-agency-tour/"></a>covering the event for more details.  And if you&#8217;re not attending Media and Communication Club meetings, now&#8217;s a good time to get involved!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-family: Arial;font-size: small"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-195" src="http://mediacom.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2009/10/acp-camera-1.jpg" alt="acp-camera-1" width="300" height="199" />Thinking about an internship but not sure how to find one?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;font-size: small">Too busy to think about an internship or just not sure its for you?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;font-size: small">If you answered &#8220;yes&#8221; to either question, you should attend an internship information session with  Professors Kahlenberg, Ranieri and Sullivan, <span style="color: #ff0000"><strong>Tuesday, November 3, at 7 p.m. in Seegers 110</strong></span>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;font-size: small"> This session will provide juniors and seniors with timely and practical guidance on why to do an internship, tips for finding internships that match your interests and needs, and how to apply for internships following college and department guidelines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;font-size: small">With the unemployment rate reaching a  twenty-six year high, college graduates entering the job market today  face exceptional challenges. The competition is fierce. New graduates  must compete for scarce jobs with experienced professionals whose jobs  disappeared in the recent waves of layoffs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;font-size: small">How can you prepare for this challenge? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;font-size: small">In the field of media and communication,  internships are a must! Even in good economic times, many employers  will not consider applicants for entry-level communication positions  unless they have successfully completed one or more internships in the  field. Some supervisors of prestigious internships will not even consider  applicants for internships who have not already had previous internship  experience. In the current economic climate, you need to do everything  you possibly can to prepare for what is ahead. In addition to the resume  building work experience that internships provide, they can also help  you to network with professionals who can provide you with letters of  recommendation and future job leads. Sometimes internships can even  lead directly to job offers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;font-size: small">Because of the exceptional economic climate  that our students are now facing, the Media and Communication Faculty  is taking extraordinary measures to encourage and facilitate internships.  We urge all students to seriously consider adding an internship to your  spring schedule. </span></p>
