								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The motives found for posting on Instagram are surveillance/knowledge about others, documentation, and coolness. According to &#8220;Instagram: Motives for its use and relationship to narcissism and contextual age&#8221;, of the motives “Surveillance/Knowledge about others” was the most influential reason behind Instagram use&#8221; (Sheldon and Bryant). I myself use Instagram often for knowledge about others and have noticed that my peers also do. I catch myself scrolling aimlessly just to keep updated and see what&#8217;s up with the people I follow on my account. Or I can even keep up with strangers that are not private and I go to the explore page. I can see what they are doing/have done.</p>
<p>The knowledge about others also included the following and &#8220;liking&#8221; of people&#8217;s posts. Several facts about someone can be figured out through their Instagram. This information ranges from someones economic status, relationship status, the amount of friends they have, and along with that who their closest friends are, etc. My friends and I all post a lot on Instagram and a lot about us can be discovered due to what we post. This information is only viewed by our followers, but if someone is not private, anyone can follow them or just view their posts without following them. that means complete strangers form the other side of the world can see what they have been doing in their life.</p>
<p>The next motive was &#8220;Documentation&#8221;. The authors write, &#8220;The reasoning behind Documentation surfacing as a potential motive in this study is likely due to the characteristics of Instagram that set it apart from other social media forums. For instance, Instagram primarily focuses on images or pictures whereas Twitter is a more text-based forum&#8221; (Sheldon and Bryant). People like to document their lives through photos, which makes it more likely for them to post a photo to Instagram rather than composing a tweet. Another good point mentioned in this article is that &#8220;Instagram allows users to provide both a picture and text as there is an option to provide a caption underneath the image. In this way, Instagram acts as a kind of virtual photo album for many people&#8221; (Sheldon and Bryant).</p>
<p>Lastly, there is &#8220;Coolness&#8221;. When it comes to social media people usually want to be on one that is popular among their peers. There are also &#8220;cool&#8221; features on Instagram like filters, links to things that are trending, and ways to explore. Along with these cool features people like to use this social media because of self-promotion and to become more popular. Everyone wants to get a lot of &#8220;likes&#8221; on their photos to show that they are cool and popular.</p>
