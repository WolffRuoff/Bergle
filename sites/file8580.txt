								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Technology has taken a turn. Teachers and students are within a period of enlightenment and change. The educational curriculum and methods to learning are undergoing a new approach, but are yet to be fully adopted. The current stage of innovation and advancement lies between two ages, the old and the new. The direction we’re headed for is far from where we started but at the same time, nowhere near the finish. People are being forced into making changes to keep pace with the everlastingly growth of society. Some in which we don&#8217;t even question and just move on. Educators are in the midst of many technological innovations and to keep up with the leap, it has become imperative to match these alterations promptly.</p>
<p>Many educators are aware of the movement and are trying to find the perfect balance. According to Jacobs (2010, p. 7), many are asking themselves “what is it we want students to know and be able to do?” What’s the primary goal? And the answer is, change the way we do things to benefit society. In chapter one, Jacobs (2010, p. 8) stated, be more deliberate and develop better ways of learning and thinking. In other words, to spring new ideas, make life swifter and ultimately improve generations to come. But why now you may ask. Currently, society sits in a period full of technological advancements which are strengthening the ways to better ourselves. This relates to our class discussion on technological growth.</p>
<p>School is a place where students challenge themselves and try to reach their targets. But the traditional way of educating students is far from the standard set back in the late 1800’s. From ink to pencils and from papyrus to paper, to the development of e-books, computers and now tablets, curriculum and the methods in which many learn has drastically changed. According to Jacobs (2010, p. 9), it’s evolving now more than ever. Schools around the world continue taking notice and are integrating these changes into their learning process. But there is still a vast majority of schools who have not implemented these advancements yet. For example, laws and privacy, as discussed in class, has kept some away from this movement. In addition, high costs and area/region along with a slew of other factors have kept adoption rate to a minimalist.</p>
<p>In chapter one, Jacobs (2010, p. 9) stated, “the concept of what school is does not need reform-it needs new forms.” This citation further exemplifies the educational technological movement and is essential to the common theme of this essay. But why? It&#8217;s not what we&#8217;re learning that needs to be revised, it&#8217;s the method in which we learn. With all this new technology, there&#8217;s work that can be done to make students better off. Such as using new programs, shifting from written assignments to online, reducing printing and having a more interactive learning experience. Many nowadays find these methods more interesting than the standard methods of learning. The reason this movement continues on is because many find education as a key importance in society. Although some disagree, the vast majority agrees this is the right thing to do in that these progressions will better prepare students for their future, which will in due course, impact the wealth of society.</p>
<p>Education is a major area of focus. The recent increase of technological advancements has directly led to a substantial increase in ways to better off curriculum. Society is progressing fast, but not until it has fully adopted the changes will a difference be made visible. New developmental hardware and software have made it easier to learn in a variety of ways. Online programs offer more hands on experience, ease of use and an increased amount of ways that one can learn interactively. Many agree that these new methods will allow students to further engage with their studies, comprehend information more easily, and create a new way of thinking and interpreting information. But the list doesn’t stop there. With this direction in toe and progressions in full swing, it’s a great time to make a change.</p>
