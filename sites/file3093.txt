								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jonathan Nelson, &#8217;09, has just returned from five weeks in Australia, leading a group of high school students on a cross-cultural trip encompassing the Australian outback, Sydney, and the Great Barrier Reef.  After an intensive interview process, Nelson was hired as a Group Leader with The Experiment, a summer abroad program that challenges youth to develop close connections with the people and culture of another country.  Jon&#8217;s talents as a documentarian, including both photography and video, as well as his extensive leadership experience working with high school students from Allentown in the HYPE youth media program, prepared him well for the opportunity.  Check out Jon&#8217;s flickr photostream to see images from the experience:  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jonathanbnelson" target="_blank">www.flickr.com/photos/jonathanbnelson</a></p>

<p>Two teenage girls provide an insider perspective on the juvenile detention system.  A group of teens break the silence around teenagers and sexually transmitted infection.  Another group asks audiences to consider the meaning of a healthy relationship.</p>
<p>HYPE teens screened three short documentaries on topics of their own choosing.  For five weeks this summer, they researched, produced, and edited 5-7 minute documentary projects.  From Walson Hall to the streets of center city Allentown, the HYPE documentary teams learned how to interview, photograph, videotape and digitally edit short doc projects.  The instruction team included Joanna Whitney, &#8217;11, who used her background in media &amp; communication and anthropology as guides during the five-week intensive program.  Dr. Kahlenberg introduced the teens to media education practices, and Dr. Pooley guided them through the process of creating their own individual blogs.</p>
<p>Opportunities to collaborate with HYPE on youth media projects exist throughout the year and into summer.  Please contact Dr. Taub-Pervizpour if you&#8217;d like to get involved.</p>

<p>Like many students at Muhlenberg, Eirinn Disbrow and Avivah Furman wanted to volunteer to make their world a better place. They quickly realized however, that making a difference was much more difficult than they had thought. Undeterred, they decided to make a documentary about the challenges of volunteerism. The resulting feature, <em>Good Intentions,</em> debuted this past Friday at Muhlenberg&#8217;s Recital Hall.</p>
<p>Supported by a competitive summer research grant from Muhlenberg, Disbrow and Furman joined a group of American students who signed up to volunteer in Costa Rica. They documented their own experiences and those of their colleagues, focusing on the students&#8217; eagerness and occasional naivete. The film, completed with assistance from a number of Media &amp; Comm faculty,  is a compelling account of the challenges that stand between good intentions and successful results.</p>
<p>Disbrow is a Media &amp; Communication major and Creative Writing minor from Wilton, CT. Furman is a Media &amp; Communication and Film Studies major from Hastings-on-Hudson, NY. Both are juniors.</p>
