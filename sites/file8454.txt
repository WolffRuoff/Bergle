								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Through my research, I have found that the Maximum Power, Darwin, Lotka, Energy Law, and Fourth Energy Law, found within chapter 3 of “Environment, Power, and Society”, by Howard T. Odum, can be used as a theory backing a recent innovation created by the company Sunatics for a solar charger which is a solution for limiting the amount of carbon dioxide within our air that affects our bodies, resulting in damaged blood vessels. This problem is also the controlling problem within the peer reviewed article “The Effects of Pollution”, which is a study done by the University of Toronto and published by American Fitness. The study conducted by University of Toronto, “The Effects of Pollution”, examined 25 healthy humans inhaling elevated concentrations of fine particles and ozone for two hours. After exposure, the volunteers’ blood vessels constricted between 2% and 4% on average (American Fitness). One can only imagine the toll that air pollution has taken on the millions of people around the world. This is disturbing because we as an intellectual society have found numerous ways to limit the amount of air pollution, yet we still haven’t utilized them efficiently. Interestingly enough, one of the many truths towards how we can limit our air pollution can be found in the studies of some of the greatest minds throughout history. In the 19<sup>th</sup> century Darwin popularized the concept of natural selection, and then during the early 20<sup>th</sup> century Lotka indicated that the maximization of power for useful purposes was the criterion for natural selection (Odum). Combining their two laws we find a central ideology that the species that uses the power found within the resources given to them will live the longest and maintain dominance within the idea of Natural Selection. Later Odum states “Systems that prevail are those with loading adjusted to operate at the peak of power efficiency”. What I find most interesting about this idea is how Odum uses the word “Systems”. A system is a set of things working together as parts of a mechanism or an interconnecting network. If humans are an interconnected network, then why aren’t we using all of our given resources in order to lower the amount of air pollution within our society? Our society has created more thane enough innovations to reduce air pollution, for example Sunatics new portable battery changer. “Our solar chargers require no batteries to operate, it’s important to have a portable solar charger that does not use batteries”, this limits the amount of energy used creating a society that will work as a system, cleaning our air all over the earth. Air pollution affects all life. Although humans are often depicted as selfish beings, we need clean air in order to maintain stability within our lives and a healthy lifestyle. The effects of air pollution are way more rapid and life changing then we could ever even imagine. The longer we choose to sit around and not use the available resources within our society in order to improve the qualities of our health, the more we are killing one another. The University of Toronto found that the constriction caused by air pollution could conceivably trigger cardiac events in individuals who have or are at risk for heart disease. I agree with the argument being placed by this university because if the most well respected minds within the science world understand the idea that the earth is a system within itself and has the proper tools to act as a proper system but the living organisms within it must abide by its rules and use its resources, then this problem of air pollution is solvable. The earth was created with the resources in order to fix the problems that its species create. Ultimately it comes down to whether we care enough about our health to act and make a difference in this world or to sit around and let our earth wither away.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Facebook is a social networking service that was founded on February 4<sup>th</sup>, 2004, by Mark Zuckerberg with his Harvard College roommates Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes. The underlying purpose of Facebook was not only to connect each and every individual within our society but to link the information within it as well. Facebook did accomplish this goal but little did our society know how drastic of an impact this net working site would have towards our relationships with the individuals around us. Facebook not only gave us the ability to connect to one another but it also gave us the capability to weaken our real life relationships. This study, published by the Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, was founded by a survey of 582 responses gathered via Twitter on the factors that predicted whether someone would avoid a person who unfriended them.</p>
<p>With just a click of a button we were given the power to ultimately, terminate or create new connections. At first, this was an extremely elementary and unmeaningful act that demonstrated no true expression towards the accuracy of emotions felt between two individuals. But as Facebook grew, so did the level of its power towards depicting how we view each and every relationship that we currently found ourselves in. Still, many don’t realize the harsh impact that we find ourselves with when unfriending someone on Facebook, which is why social networking can lead to a wide variety of issues. “People think social networks are just for fun,” says study author Christopher Sibona, a doctoral student in computer science and information systems. Although one could pose an argument as to the very little weight social media plays in our society when viewing it from a certain aspect, there is also an extreme drawback within this idea. When two individuals are connected by anything, that certain “connector” contains much more emotional weight then it may appear. If each individual finds the same level of importance within that certain “connector” then the relationship between them will be at an adequate level of understanding. However, if one individual within that particular relationship seems to hold more importance then the other, it will be difficult for each of them to understand each other from an emotional stand point. This misunderstanding, then, seems to creep away from its social networking origins and finds the ability to stem into real world consequences. Sibona found that “40% of people surveyed said that they would avoid in real life anyone who unfriended them on Facebook. Some 50% said they would not avoid the person who unfriended them, and the remaining 10% were unsure”. So within a single click clutches the emotional influence to not only terminate a relationship in the digital world but the real world as well. But this isn’t Facebooks fault. Its original purpose was to connect individuals to one another. The fault must be bestowed within each user who consists in this site due to the fact that they create and set the standard of significance that each online “friendship” can carry into the real world. Social media is strictly what the user choses to make of it.</p>
<p>Within the writings of this article, Sibona found six main factors that predicted whether the termination within each friendship would remain on a digital level or carry over in the real world. One of the 6 factors Sibona found was, “If the person discussed the event after it happened”. So if the individual that part took within the act of unfriending found the need to make a real world reinforcement of their particular termination towards any individual it would then lead to a total halt of the friendship. Another factor Sibona found was, “How strong the person valued the relationship before the unfriending.” So this unprecedented standard that Facebook seems to establish from an emotional standpoint plays a major role in how substantial the value of the unfriending may turn out to be. Illustrating that although Facebook connects us, it may not necessarily connect us in all the right ways due to the actuality within the sites importance. One could argue, “It’s best to not look into these small actions found within our many social networking sites”, but its safe to say that we have reach a certain level of aptitude towards the power these sites play in our culture and throughout our society.</p>
<p>Instead of trying to fight these changes that we are seeing with the role of social networking in our society, we should accept them. For some, this idea may be foreign but eventually they will have no other choice. Social media has already taken its toll on so many different audiences throughout our society. “Americans now spend about 25% of their time online using social networks like Facebook, which has over a billion members”, so for our society to be able to interact and understand each other on an emotional level that existed during the time before these social media sites were born, we must understand them and subside to their values. “Online interactions have their own rules, language, and etiquette”. How could we as a society interact if we all didn’t speak the same language? These sites must be enlightened to those who don’t completely understand the morals engraved within them. The toll that could be taken on each individual can climb higher then an emotional level. “People who are unfriended may face similar psychological effects&#8230;because unfriending may be viewed as a form of social exclusion”. So a tool that was created to socially include each and every individual into a worldwide community is now being justified as the reason certain individuals feel excluded. This goes back to this idea of the miscommunication of the prominence of these sites.</p>
<p>The crucial notion that this article illustrates is the idea that social media won’t halt just because a certain portion of our society hasn’t adapted to the level of adequacy portrayed within its digital background. Social media will continue to impact our relations and not only will it linger but it will continue to flourish within our society. The sooner we begin to understand theses numerous social media sites, the sooner we will understand how to use these tools to their full potential, creating an efficient ideology within the role these sites will play throughout our culture.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“I’m Going to Instagram It! An Analysis of Athlete Self-Presentation on Instagram”, by Lauren Reichart Smith and Jimmy Sanderson, is a well developed research article that discusses how athletes portray themselves over Social Media. Sanderson and Smith’s study was fabricated from the principles of Goffman’s notion of self presentation and gender displays. They took this already gratified research and used it as a tool to find a more accurate truth when examining 27 professional athletes&#8217; Instagram feeds to determine how these athletes are using this new visual resource to present themselves to the public and to their fans. Throughout this study we see the capabilities that Social Media has towards athletes who are inaccurately depicted under the public eye solely because of the media. Sanderson and Smith focus in on the influence that Social Media has towards fighting the norm that history has set when discussing gender roles.</p>
<p>Almost every athlete that I know conforms to some type of Social Media. Their reasoning behind which Social Media they elect to partake in varies tremendously, but the benefits of each resource remains consistent. As described by Sanderson and Smith, Social Media is ‘‘Architected by design to readily support participation, peer-to-peer conversation, collaboration, and community’’, so even though their motives differ, Social Media still appears to touch all athletes due to the fact that it’s easily accessible; it allows each athlete as an individual to reach out to his or her fans on a more personal level and it offers them a sense of community and belonging. Seemingly enough, we find all of those same incentives that are instilled within Social Media can be found in every major sport in our society. As well as containing the ability to depict a certain aspect of community, Social Media also gives each athlete a say on a personal level. Sanderson and Smith prove that the influence of Social Media gives professional athletes the capability to express their stance when analyzing a prior dispute between Boston Red Sox pitcher Curt Schilling after he was accused of faking an injury along with criticizing fellow player Barry Bonds. Immediately after hearing the allegations, Schilling fought back with the only credible resource he has access to, his blog. Curt opposed the rumors that the media had been spreading and defended his well being. Interestingly enough while in the process of setting his story straight, Curt developed a sense of respect from his fans for taking the offense against the media critics. So, not only did Social Media give Schilling the ability to maintain his reputation, but it also improved it in the process. Just one of the many stories that Sanderson and Smith touch upon that illustrate the idea that the power of Social Media is infinite.</p>
<p>Although this study found that Social Media gives athletes a declaration when confronting issues derived from the media, it focused more on some very compelling findings on the conventions, habits, and deeper meanings behind professional athlete’s photos along with their captions when looking at posts on Instagram. Social media not only combats the media, but it also creates opportunities for each athlete to show a more accurate depiction of who they truly are. Within these findings, Sanderson and Smith found that the “Majority of the photos framed the athlete from a distant perspective, showing off the entire body”. The reason this is so fascinating is because throughout history, people that upheld immense stature within our society veered towards having head shots to display themselves rather than a whole body shot. Social media unintentionally established a method to alter the standard that society had set on how a high standard individual “should” portray themselves. When pertaining to female athletes, Sanderson and Smith noticed that many “take this opportunity to buck the trend of visual representations found in the media, and present themselves as athletes first, females second”. Once again, we see how Social media takes a stand towards the image that history has created for our society. Using Social Media, female athletes now have a legitimate resource, allowing them to provide valid “hype” and “status” as to why they should be considered serious athletes.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Social Media contains the ability to give not only professional athletes, but every man and woman fair representation of who they truly are. In addition to allowing them to illustrate themselves, it allows a window of creativity, to simulate an image of what they want to be. Social Media has no laws, prejudgments, or set norms of what an individual can be. It only assists each person, allowing them to find who they truly are as an individual. As Social Media continues to grow, one can only imagine the impacts it will have on not only our self representation but our society as well.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recently, New York Times Journalist, Stuart Goldenberg, wrote an article called “IPhone 6s’s Hands-Free Siri Is an Omen of the Future”, which essentially conveys the idea that our society is taking a new, technological direction towards voice recognition and artificial intelligence. He describes the two as “A necessary part of Modern Computing”. A well defended statement but in a way he is almost contradicting his own argument because if he is saying that these two applications are “necessary” to Modern computing throughout our society then why is he minimizing its significance by describing it as a “part”? Later in the article he describes this revolutionary new idea, known as “Ambient Computing”, which Stuart describes as “a future in which robotic assistants are always on hand to answer questions, take notes, take orders or otherwise function as auxiliary brains to whom you might offload many of your chores”. Oddly enough he describes this as a “futuristic” idea but can’t one argue that our Phones, Computers, TVs, Videogames and all of our other twenty first century devices could hold the title of “Robotic Assistants” due to the fact that they do withstand most of our Dailey loads, making our lives not only easier but more simplistic as well. So rather Ambient Computing be considered a “futuristic” goal, I think its fair to say that its something that we have easily touched heavily upon but that there is also so much still out there that we haven’t created that can still revolutionize our day to day lives. Goldenberg eventually takes a social turn on the power of artificial intelligence, along with voice recognition, when he writes “It will be slightly creepy and completely helpful”. Conveying the idea that, at first, we may be very hesitant towards this very odd but incredible technology but that instead of seeing either one or the other, we will see that even those who find it to be “creepy” or “odd” will submit to its foreignness due to the beneficial value it has to offer. Stuart then shows us how these creatures of this never ending technology realm are adapting to this new technology when he points out a very compatible new app called “Sound Hound” which is basically a voice powered search engine that has the ability and potential to revolutionize the way we search by giving us more in depth results of the precise thing we were looking for. Illustrating the idea that the many faces of our technological world are completely on board with this very clear-cut direction. Towards the end of the article, Stuart starts to describe his take on the steps we will soon see most individuals go through when cooping with this new machinery when he utters “The more assistants there are, and the more you use them, the more natural they feel — and that means the more you’ll use them, feeding the cycle”. I noticed how he used the word “more” consecutively throughout that single sentence, demonstrating the idea that there is always going to be more, and that there will never come a time when people will stop thinking of new ideas. This repetition of such a simplistic world also shows that even though all of these new creations are beyond beneficial to our society, we don’t really have a chose as to if we want them to play a role in our lives. Each new deice always seems to find away into our pockets, signifying the idea that even though we “use” the technology, that we are actually, in a sense, just mere slaves that feed on the aid of these machines. At the end of the day I think its important to realize that technology will always be “there” but the term, “there” is broad, it could mean in our homes, in a store, or even in our pockets but just because its “there” doesn’t mean we have to use it, or buy it, or surround our lives around it. We have to realize that, just like everything else in life, technology is what we make of it and we, as individuals, have the power to choose the technology we find necessary to better ourselves and the technology that we consider to be wasteful.</p>

<p>The article “Want to Be a Better Writer?” by Mike Hanski conveys the idea that reading is an essential tool in every aspect of our lives, especially when dealing with our writing. He justifies that there is no real way to learn how to write and that the only truthful way to enhance the level of our writing is to read and learn from writers before us.  &#8220;If you don&#8217;t have time to read, you don&#8217;t have the time (or the tools) to write. Simple as that.&#8221; &#8211; Stephen King.</p>
<p>Throughout Hanski’s article we see him illustrate the idea that reading isn’t just a way to augment our writing but it’s also a way to improve our ability to succeed in society. Without even realizing it “Poor reading habits can lead to a person&#8217;s social exclusion.” I’m sure many people wouldn’t mind if their level of reading wasn’t at the caliber of there peers but if they knew that by them not reading they are actually diminishing their social life… I think that would be a serious game changer. Also “Science confirms that reading has a positive influence on your brain: blood flows to it, improving brain&#8217;s functioning and connectivity; moreover, it has been proved that this functioning improves for days! So, read books &#8212; and you will help your brain function better.” So, not only does reading Improve your social life but it also improves your quality of life. Towards the end of the article, we see Hanski use the word “everything” repetitively in the sentence “Read everything you like, everything that&#8217;s relevant to your feelings now, everything you believe in”. I feel as if he is trying to get the point across that not only should you read everything that you like but that reading impacts everything you like because of how much it effects every aspect of our lives.</p>
<p>Not only do I agree with Hanski but I have experienced many of the things in his article first hand. As a child, I always found it hard to start things on my own; I was always searching for a basis. For soccer I would watch highlights of my favorite players but for writing there was never a basis, you were given an assignment and you were supposed to complete it in your “own words”. This was the first time in my life that I truly didn’t have a foundation to compare my work to. I almost felt as if I had no voice or direction when I was writing. When I hit middle school, I soon realized that no one starts off with a voice and that the structure and technique that I wanted to portray within my writing was only going to be found in the works from past authors. Reading gave me the opportunity to create my own voice as a writer and without reading I wouldn’t have developed the tools or skills to become the writer I am today.</p>
