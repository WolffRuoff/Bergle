								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As online social networking sites are expanding their popularity, a phenomenon termed “Facebook envy” seems to be on the rise (Appel, 2015). The frustration of logging on to Facebook and being flooded with endless pictures, status updates and friends’ notifications showing what seems to be their perfect lives is one way to describe Facebook envy. This problem has been faced by all Facebook users since 2006 yet still, there is very few research investigating how envy can lead to many other very real physiological effects. Envy and jealousy go hand and hand with depression, yet little is known about the mechanisms underlying this connection. In the “Journal of Social &amp; Clinical Psychology, Vol. 34” a quasi-experimental study entitled, “Social Comparison, Envy, and Depression on Facebook” discusses how Facebook is a high-risk environment for depressed individuals and investigates the severity to which envy harms Facebooks 1 billion users.</p>
<p>In this study, depressed and non-depressed individuals were asked to describe their current levels of self-esteem and were then assigned and compared to a specific Facebook profile. These profiles were either attractive or unattractive and each participant compared themselves to the owner of the profile they were assigned and they reported their resulting feelings. I am sure each feeling was different than the other, yet feelings of envy were the most popular among all test subjects. The original hypothesis for this experiment was that the depressed individuals were expected to feel inferior and more envious, particularly when paired up with an attractive Facebook profile (Appel, 2015). The experiment was also expected to demonstrate how envy can be correlated with low self-esteem, and depressiveness in social comparison.</p>
<p>Social comparison on Facebook is an ongoing process that appears to be the major cause in online envy. This is all a result of Facebooks impression management which allows its users to select, edit and post pictures that misrepresent the truth behind each user’s life (Appel, 2015). This study does a fantastic job in showing how envy is created and why it is harmful. The results were written down, participants were compared to one another and it turns out that resulting envy was higher after seeing an attractive profile. Also, among depressed participants the jealousy experienced was higher than any other. Both results yielded p-values well below zero which gives us strong evidence to conclude that when depressed individuals meet Facebooks misrepresented profiles, the result is in fact envy.</p>
<p>We know by now that Facebook’s boastful atmosphere makes it a very hostile environment for depressed individuals (Appel, 2015).  The results of this experiment shed a new light on the mechanisms underlying the connection between depression and Facebook envy. With this new information, Facebook and many other social networks alike should realize the dangers their users face on a daily basis. Since online social media are already a part of most people’s lives today, interventions must take place soon in order to silence the dangers surrounding the media.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the article, <em>Social Media Is Redefining ‘Depression’, </em>Bine discusses how Tumblr has become a major platform for teenage girls with mental illness to express themselves publicly in an anonymous way. Tumblr is a form of social media that was developed to promote photography and blogging through pictures. Bine interviews a teenage girl named Laura who has fell victim to the massive online Tumblr community that accepts her for her depression. Bine mentions the Silver Bubble Problem, in which it is, “difficult for those inside the community to see the outside world…But they often don’t want to get out because to leave the community would be to lose the people who understand them.” (Bine 2013, p. 4) While being accepted though, Laura’s identity is still able to remain hidden from the people she knows in the outside world. This anonymity produces its own safety in knowing that “nobody” will find out about what you post. Bine goes on to discuss how a combination of intense feelings, misunderstanding, and a closed off online community all contribute to the exponential rise in depression throughout this upcoming generation.</p>
<p>Yes, Depression combined with an online community of other depressed people is leading to a glorification of a serious mental health issue. When depressed teenagers take to Tumblr, it leads to a, “growing community of people feeding off of each other’s strong emotions, and it’s definitely visible online.” (Bine 2013, p. 3) And yes, it is definitely accurate to say that not everyone who reblogs depressing imagery is clinically depressed themselves and many “adolescents are confusing the clinical disorder called ‘depression’ with normal, everyday challenges.” (Bine 2013, p. 2) However, when Tumblr users feel almost, “strong, beautiful, and mysterious” (Bine 2013, p. 2) for posting, “black and white photos with scars along their wrists, from taking razor blades to their skin” (Bine 2013, p. 1) and are recognized and most infamously, praised for it, this is where the problem of interpretation begins.</p>
<p>Bine is ignorantly incorrect to state that the self expression pertaining to depression has created a, “frenzy” (Bine 2013, p. 2) on Tumblr, for she thinks girls are giving into peer pressure and are self-harming because it is the cool thing to do. It is extremely offensive for Bine to label this social phenomenon as people who are, “‘wannabe depressed’” (Bine 2013, p. 2). Nobody wants to be depressed.  This insensitive label invalidates an adolescent’s emotions, which is all he/she really wants from posting on Tumblr in the first place. This is the problem. The controversy is in the way that these feelings are being expressed and the validity that comes with them. Teenage girls are being praised for being depressed, which turns depression into something that is normal or healthy. Teenagers are aloud to express themselves on the internet, but when it comes to mental illness, there should be a community focusing on recovery and support. Bine misinterprets and invalidates these depression blogs as teenagers, “advertising their suffering.” (Bine 2013, p. 5) She misses the point completely, and doesn’t realize that these teens are going through a difficult time and are simply calling for help through the only tool they feel comfortable with, the internet. The conversation of handling depression is very important in this day and age, however, it must be emphasizing healthy and appropriate ways to treat and overcome depression, not casting it off as an indulgent frenzied phenomenon.</p>
