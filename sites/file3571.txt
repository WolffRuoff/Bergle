					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Streaming video is definitely a distribution technology that looks like it is going to potentially disrupt the status quo for the television industry.  In this case, smaller distributors like DishTV are battling with the larger media conglomerates (which themselves are producer/distributor/exhibitors of traditional media, so they hold a lot of power).  Because of copyrights, the traditional media firms have the upper hand in this looming battle, but it does look to be like an interesting one in the near future.  Good job here.&lt;/p&gt;
