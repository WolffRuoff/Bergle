					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;My name is Jerry Glose (yes, that is me with the green beard) I am the husband of Coach Christine and serve as her assistant coach. I can&#039;t thank you all enough for your help! Every year our County Event is our favorite time as our bowlers are competing for awards. Having the awards ready is always hard as you never know what lane is going to finish first or if they are ALL going to finish at the same time! With your volunteers helping tally the scores and hand out the awards everything went smoother than ever and the athletes loved having you there! I hope to see you again next year. Thanks from the bottom of my heart.&lt;/p&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;A well written article. The volunteers were great! The athletes loved having them. I was glad they could help. The day really did move a lot smoother than it usually does at the CountyEvent. We had very good feed back from the parents/guardians and athletes. It will be a long remembered day. Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;
