								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today I have my last class of the semester in Dublin and my last class prior to senior year. It has been a wonderful adventure and experience over here, amplified by the presence of 19 other Muhlenberg students and Dr. John Sullivan of the Comm department. One of the things I have really appreciated about my classes here is how valued my voice and opinions are as an American. Sure, other Americans study in Ireland, but when discussing films by Scorsese or looking at pictures of New York, the voice and perspective of a US citizen is quite important. There are a lot of Irish students who haven&#8217;t been to the US and have notions of it from watching movies and TV shows. To be in the class when discussing 9/11 and have such a unique take is an experience I will not soon forget.</p>
<p>Every country has stereotypes, and you can find a lot of vocal students who paint broad depictions of the US as a country filled with skyscrapers and people who love their guns. I have listened to these depictions daily and not criticized them at all; I find it fascinating to hear what others think, and it makes a great conversation. At the same time, I have learned so much about Ireland from my lecturers that has proved worthwhile. As a visiting student, you take in sights, read the local newspaper and begin to develop opinions on Irish life. You may love a certain part of Dublin only to hear a lecturer later say how weird that part of the city is and how they wouldn&#8217;t touch it with a ten foot pole. That is travel and that is experience, the ultimate reasons why you study abroad.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After 5 weeks into my classes at DCU, I thought I might comment on some differences in education styles between Ireland and the US.</p>
<p>I am taking two courses taught by Dublin City University faculty, and they consist of one lecture per week and one seminar per week. Both are intro comm courses, and students tend to take both at the same time. The lecture is obviously in a lecture hall with an average of 40 students, whereas the seminar has between 5 and 10.</p>
<p>The seminars are nice, because that is when you really get to know the professor and participate in class discussion. One of my seminars is almost all international students, 5 total, and it is great to get so many different perspectives. A lot of the exchange students here are from Europe, with a large group from the US and smaller groups from Latin America and Asia. It is a much more relaxed, informal, and quite frankly distracting at times, classroom experience. Everyone has their laptop open during the lecture (usually to Facebook) and it is quite common to have students speaking while the lecturer is talking. This is a key cultural difference, as Irish lecturers will tell you that the students often arrive late and leave early and are frankly not as reliable as Americans when it comes to assignments.</p>
<p>Group work is also big here; both of my classes rely heavily on group projects extended over a month-long period. It is nice, because my partners on both projects come from countries like Romania, Mexico, Italy and Germany. You learn a lot from each other, and that is really what any form of education is about. It is great to have exposure to different education systems, and like the study abroad mantra goes, it&#8217;s different, not worse.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>My name is Alexander and I am a junior double major in Film Studies and Media and Communications. This semester I am in Dublin, Ireland with 19 other Muhlenberg students and a professor studying at Dublin City University. While this is only the 2nd year this program has been offered, it has already developed into one of the largest study abroad programs the college has.</p>
<p>Prior to this semester, I was incredibly active in the Muhlenberg Film Association and Social Justice Collaborative, two clubs which have grown tremendously over the years. Back at &#8216;Berg I have taken film courses ranging from introductory analysis to in-depth studies of the French New Wave and Bollywood. I have been fortunate to have great professors along the way who are incredibly accessible, one of the reasons why I chose Muhlenberg to begin with. Media and Communications is another great major, as well as one of the largest at the school. So far I have taken Media and Society, Documentary Research, Media Theory and Methods and Fundamentals of Visual Communication. In Dublin we are taking a course called The Politics of Media Reform, looking at social movements in the 20th century over broadcasting rights.</p>
