<p><strong>Cross Country at Cedar Crest/Muhlenberg Invitational (Saturday, 10:00)<br />
</strong></p>
<p>The Mules compete in the closest thing they have to a home meet, crossing Ott Street to race for the first time in three weeks. Last year, the Muhlenberg teams swept this meet for the first time since 2008. Both Mule squads are ranked in the top 10 in the Mideast Region.</p>
<p><strong>Volleyball vs. Johns Hopkins (Saturday, 1:00)</strong></p>
<p>The two-time defending Centennial Conference champion Blue Jays kick off (or is it serve off?) the on-campus Homecoming activities. Hopkins comes in 5-4, with all of its losses coming to nationally ranked teams, while Muhlenberg is 6-4. Johns Hopkins holds a 16-5 series lead and has won 10 of the last 11 meetings.</p>
<p>Live stats: <a href="http://www.muhlenberg.edu/sports/vblive/topview.htm">http://www.muhlenberg.edu/sports/vblive/topview.htm</a></p>
<p><strong>Football vs. McDaniel (Saturday, 2:00)</strong></p>
<p>McDaniel nearly spoiled Homecoming two years ago, opening up a 26-7 lead before the Mules rallied with 27 fourth-quarter points. The Green Terror beat Moravian last weekend to snap a 13-game losing streak, while Muhlenberg is coming off a 28-21 loss at Franklin &amp; Marshall. McDaniel leads the all-time series, 22-18-3, but the Mules have won the last three meetings, rolling up a 413-168 margin in total yards in last year&#8217;s 33-0 shutout.</p>
<p>Green Terror senior running back Joe Rollins will be a player to watch, and one to tackle for the Muhlenberg defense. He rushed for 219 yards last week and is the ninth all-time leading rusher in Centennial Conference history.</p>

<p><strong>Women&#8217;s Soccer vs. Johns Hopkins (Saturday, 3:00)</strong></p>
<p>Johns Hopkins (8-0) soared to the top spot of the D3soccer.com Division III rankings after scoring road wins against then-No. 1 Messiah and then-No. 5 Carnegie Mellon. The Blue Jays are 37-4 in the Centennial Conference regular season over the last four-plus years, but three of those losses were to Muhlenberg, each time with Hopkins ranked in the top 10. The Mules (3-2-1) will look to make history repeat &#8211; again. They come in with a four-match unbeaten streak and an unscored-upon streak of 380 minutes.</p>

<p><strong>Men&#8217;s Soccer vs. Gettysburg (Saturday, 7:00)</strong></p>
<p>The last home event of Homecoming matches two teams that dominated the early days of the Centennial Conference, combining to win five of the first seven titles, but both failed to make the playoffs last year. Muhlenberg (4-2) is ranked eighth in the Mid-Atlantic Region, while Gettysburg (0-5) has lost eight straight dating back to last season. Included in the Bullets&#8217; setbacks is a 3-1 loss to Neumann, who the Mules beat. Muhlenberg holds a 35-18-6 series lead and is 8-0-1 against Gettysburg since the 2005 regular season.</p>

<p><strong>Field Hockey vs. McDaniel (Friday, 7:00)</strong></p>
<p>After winning their home opener in decisive fashion (5-1 vs. King&#8217;s) on Wednesday, the Mules stay at home to take on McDaniel in the first Centennial Conference game of the year. The Green Terror (2-2) won its first two games in overtime but has been shut out in its last two outings. Both teams finished 4-6 in the CC last year, and they played an appropriately evenly matched game, with Muhlenberg coming back twice to win 4-3 in overtime. The Mules lead, 11-9, in a series in which the road team has won the last four games.</p>

<p><strong>Football at Franklin &amp; Marshall (Saturday, 1:00)</strong></p>
<p>The defending Centennial Conference runner-up travels to Lancaster to face the team picked to finish second in the 2013 preseason poll. The teams&#8217; openers could not have been much different, with Muhlenberg rolling past The Apprentice School, 59-6, and the Diplomats losing to Washington and Lee, 14-13, on a failed two-point conversion in the final 30 seconds.</p>
<p>Franklin &amp; Marshall leads the all-time series, 52-43-1, but the Mules won the last two meetings by three touchdowns, including last season&#8217;s 21-0 shutout. Muhlenberg starting QB Joe Carlucci is the older brother of F&amp;M backup Anthony Carlucci, who played the second half of last year&#8217;s game.</p>

<p><strong>Volleyball at McDaniel (Saturday, 12:00); vs. Goucher (Saturday, 2:00)</strong></p>
<p>The Mules (4-4), who split on their first two weekends of play in 2013, will try to sweep this tri-match, just like they did last year, when they beat McDaniel in four sets and Goucher in three. The Green Terror (3-2), two years removed from a winless season, is improving but carries a 22-match CC losing streak into this contest. McDaniel leads the all-time series, 15-6, although Muhlenberg has won three of the last five. Goucher is 6-3.</p>

<p><strong>Women&#8217;s Soccer at McDaniel (Saturday, 4:00)</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg (2-2) takes its two-game winning streak into its CC opener against McDaniel, which outscored its first three opponents by a 16-0 margin before suffering a 4-2 loss to York on Wednesday. The Mules allowed only three goals in CC games last year, but one of them was to McDaniel in a 1-0 loss to open the league season. Muhlenberg went on to finish 6-3-1 and earn a playoff berth, while McDaniel ended at 2-7-1. The Mules lead the series, 13-6-1, and had not lost to the Green Terror since 2003 before last year.</p>

<p><strong>Volleyball hosts Buttermaker Tournament (Friday vs. Penn State Abington, 3:00; Friday vs. Neumann, 7:00; Saturday opponents TBD, 10:00 and 2:00)</strong></p>
<p>The 16<sup>th</sup> annual tournament will feature 18 matches among nine teams in a period of about 25 hours. Muhlenberg (2-2) is looking for its first Buttermaker title since 2005. Defending champion Salisbury has to be considered the favorite to repeat; the Seagulls (37-4 last year) come in ranked 22<sup>nd</sup> in the Division III preseason poll and are off to a 4-0 start. The Mules’ first two opponents have already been swept by Centennial Conference teams – Penn State Abington (0-3) by McDaniel and Neumann (1-3) by Haverford.</p>

<p><strong>Football vs. The Apprentice School (Saturday, 1:00)</strong></p>
<p>The Mules open their 112<sup>th</sup> season of football with their only non-conference game of the season. Last year, in the first meeting between the two schools, Muhlenberg fell into an early 7-0 hole before rallying to win, 27-7, en route to an 8-3 campaign that included a bid to the ECAC South Atlantic Bowl. The Builders finished up at 2-8. Both teams will feature new faces on both sides of the ball. The Mules have won six of their last seven home openers, and when their first home game has been in the afternoon, they haven’t lost since 2003.</p>

<p>The last time these two teams squared off on Varsity Field, Muhlenberg won 4-0 in a 1995 NCAA Tournament quarterfinal match, earning a trip to its only “Final Four.” The teams didn’t play again until last season, when Ithaca made an early goal stand up in a 1-0 win. The Mules (2-1) are ranked ninth in the Mid-Atlantic Region and come in with two straight shutouts. The Bombers (0-2), the defending Empire 8 co-champions, took nationally ranked Oneonta State to overtime in their season opener.</p>

<p>The Mules go back-to-back for the second straight weekend after losing a pair of matches to regionally ranked opponents last weekend. Last year, Muhlenberg played these teams in the opposite order, defeating Gwynedd-Mercy 1-0 in overtime a day after losing to Delaware Valley by the same score.

			<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/12/bollhs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1585" title="Katherine Boll" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/12/bollhs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Before the first serve went up for 2012 season, freshman Katherine Boll had already made her mark on the Muhlenberg volleyball program.</p>
<p>Boll had committed to come play for the Mules and was browsing the Muhlenberg website during her senior year of high school when she found something missing for her new team. “I just decided I was going to make us a logo,” she recalled.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/12/Mulevolleyballclr.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1584" title="Muhlenberg volleyball logo" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/12/Mulevolleyballclr.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="190" /></a>That logo (pictured here) was used by head coach Alexa Keckler on her camp t-shirts over the summer and was also used in the team’s yearbook. And yes, it’s on the website now too.</p>
<p>The logo was just one of many design projects for Boll, whose talent on the volleyball court (she was named to the All-Centennial Conference second team as a freshman) is matched by her affinity for creativity.</p>
<p>Boll says that when she was little, she was always doing arts and crafts. But her interest in graphic design really took off after she worked on the yearbook staff as a junior at Seacrest Country Day School in her hometown of Naples, Fla.</p>
<p>Watching tutorials on YouTube, Boll learned how to use Illustrator and PhotoShop. Then as a senior, she did an independent study with a family friend who has a master’s in graphic design.</p>

The plaque includes a quote from Walt Whitman: “The strongest and sweetest songs yet remain to be sung.”</p>
<p>“It’s funny, because once people know that you do this, they just come to you,” she said. “I had a friend who was starting a restaurant in Naples, and I did a flyer introducing the restaurant. I also did stuff for the yearbook, student government and the prom.”</p>

Some of her works are pictured below. She will look to branch out even more when she takes a class on digital photography in the spring semester.</p>
<p>“If it was up to me, I would be taking all art classes!” she joked.</p>
<p>And even though she still intends to major in psychology, another subject in which she has great interest, Boll says she can definitely see a career in design in her future.</p>
<p>“[The family friend] told me once about how he was up all night finishing a project for a customer,” she said. “And I was like ‘I’m jealous!’ I’d love to do something like that.”</p>

			<p><em>The last weekend of October means falling leaves, Halloween, nasty weather in the forecast &#8211; and the fall sports seasons winding down. Two Muhlenberg teams will end their seasons tomorrow, while two others hope to continue theirs.</em></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-104" title="Mule Marquee Matchup" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="237" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg 350w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1-300x203.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" /></a>Women&#8217;s Soccer at Ursinus (7:30)</strong></p>
<p>This is the only game in which a Muhlenberg team can chart its own playoff course. With a win, the Mules are in &#8211; although, since the only team that can catch them (Dickinson) plays at noon, by the time this game kicks off they might be in already!</p>
<p>Muhlenberg (7-8-2, 5-3-1) is in fifth place in the Centennial Conference. Dickinson (11-5, 5-4) needs a win against Franklin &amp; Marshall and a Mule loss or tie to snatch away the final playoff spot. If the Mules win, they will face the loser of the Haverford-Swarthmore game in the first round (or Swarthmore if that game ends in a tie).</p>
<p>Although Ursinus (3-8-4, 0-5-4) is winless in CC play, it did take Haverford and Dickinson to double overtime.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg leads the all-time series, 13-6, but the Bears have won the last two meetings &#8211; including a 2010 game in Collegeville in which the Mules needed a win to stay alive in the playoff race.</p>

<p><strong>Field Hockey at Ursinus (12:00)</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg (9-6, 4-5) closes out a season of great improvement with a chance to beat eight-time defending champion Ursinus (9-7, 5-4) for the first time ever. The Bears need a win and help to make the playoffs.</p>

<p><strong>Volleyball at Ursinus (12:00)</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s the last match of the season for the Mules (16-11, 3-6), who have a chance to reach 17 wins for the first time since 2008. They won a total of 16 matches the last two years. Ursinus (7-16, 2-7) has lost to Muhlenberg eight straight times.</p>
<p><strong>Football at Dickinson (1:00)</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg (5-2, 4-2) plays a road game for the first time in almost a month against a Red Devil team coming off a comeback overtime win against McDaniel. It&#8217;s been feast or famine for Dickinson (3-4, 3-3): It lost big to to nationally ranked Hobart (31-0) and Johns Hopkins (49-0), but its other five games were all decided by eight points or fewer.</p>
<p>The Mules lead the all-time series, 40-25-2, and have won four of the last five meetings, including last season&#8217;s 12-0 &#8220;Snowtober&#8221; game.</p>

<p><strong>Men&#8217;s Soccer at Ursinus, 5:00</strong></p>
<p>The Mules (10-5, 5-4) enter the final day of the regular season needing a win or tie and a Johns Hopkins loss OR a win and a JHU draw to make the playoff field. The Blue Jays play at Washington at 7:00.</p>
<p>Ursinus (5-11, 1-7) has lost seven straight CC contests since opening with a win against Gettysburg and has allowed a league-worst 24 goals in conference play.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg has an all-time record of 18-0-1 against Ursinus in CC play. The tie, however, came in Collegeville in 2006 when the Mules needed a win to secure a home playoff game.</p>

			<p><em>The last busy fall Saturday of the fall sports season at Muhlenberg is a big one for several teams. Of the five teams at home, four are playing Gettysburg in contests that have playoff implications for the Mules. It&#8217;s hard to single out just one as the Marquee Matchup, but we&#8217;ll try &#8230;</em></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-104" title="Mule Marquee Matchup" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="237" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg 350w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1-300x203.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" /></a>Women&#8217;s Soccer vs. Gettysburg (4:00)</strong></p>
<p>This game pits two teams that are in great position for making the Centennial Conference playoffs. Gettysburg (10-4, 6-1) is tied for first place with Johns Hopkins, and Muhlenberg (7-6-2, 5-2-1) is right behind in third place.</p>
<p>The Bullets clinch a playoff berth with a win or a tie, and the Mules secure a postseason spot with a win.</p>
<p>Gettysburg leads the Conference with 21 goals scored in league matches, while Muhlenberg has allowed only two goals to CC opponents &#8211; none in the last 470 minutes.</p>
<p>The Bullets are ranked fourth in the region by the NSCAA and seventh in the region by the NCAA. When the final horn blows, the Mules will have played seven of the 10 teams in this week’s NSCAA Mid-Atlantic rankings: Messiah (1), Johns Hopkins (3), Gettysburg (4), Swarthmore (5), Haverford (6), Dickinson (8) and Wilkes (10). Muhlenberg is 3-3 against these ranked opponents, with two of the losses coming by one goal.</p>
<p align="left">Gettysburg won at home the last two years to extend its series lead to 14-7-2, although since 2001 Muhlenberg has the upper hand, 7-5-1. The Bullets have not won at Varsity Field since 2005.</p>

<p align="left">Muhlenberg&#8217;s last home appearance of the season features an important match against Gettysburg, which the Mules (15-9, 3-5) must win if they are to have a shot at making the playoffs. The Bullets (14-10, 5-2), who lost to Washington in five sets, still have to play CC co-leaders Franklin &amp; Marshall and Johns Hopkins.</p>
<p align="left">Gettysburg has won 25 of 27 all-time meetings against Muhlenberg. The Mules’ lone wins came in their playoff seasons of 2001 and 2009.</p>
<p align="left">Muhlenberg is 2-6 all-time against York (6-23). The teams last met in 2009.</p>

<p align="left">The Mules (4-2, 3-2) are playing CC home games in back-to-back weeks for the first time ever, and following last week&#8217;s dramatic win against previously undefeated Gettysburg, they will try to avoid a letdown against an improving Juniata (1-5, 0-5) squad.</p>
<p align="left">Muhlenberg is 7-0 all-time against Juniata and has not allowed an offensive touchdown to the Eagles since they joined the CC in 2007.</p>
<p align="left">Senior Terrence Dandridge needs 121 yards to become the 11th player in CC history to rush for 3,000.</p>

<p align="left"><strong>Field Hockey vs. Gettysburg (6:00)</strong></p>
<p align="left">Gettysburg and Muhlenberg are two of the eight teams still mathematically alive for the four remaining CC playoff berths. (First-place Franklin &amp; Marshall has clinched.) Gettysburg (10-3, 5-2), Washington and Haverford have two losses apiece, and then there are four teams with four losses, including Muhlenberg (9-5, 4-4).</p>
<p align="left">The Mules have four shutouts in their last seven games, including one Wednesday against Swarthmore (a team to which the Bullets lost), and have allowed more than one goal in a half just twice this season. They are second in the CC in goals-against average (1.27).</p>
<p align="left">Gettysburg has won four straight meetings to extend its series lead to 16-6. Last year, the Mules came back from a 2-0 deficit to tie the game, but the Bullets scored a disputed goal with 6:22 remaining for a 3-2 win.</p>

<p align="left">The final contest of the day features a Muhlenberg team that is in a dogfight for a playoff berth. With three games left to play, the Mules (9-4, 3-3) are currently tied for the fifth and final spot with Franklin &amp; Marshall and Washington.</p>
<p align="left">After beginning its CC season with a loss to Ursinus (the Bears’ lone CC win to date), Gettysburg (6-7-1, 1-4-1) has shown better of late, taking first-place Swarthmore to double overtime two weeks ago and snapping Haverford’s five-game winning streak with a 2-1 victory last Saturday.</p>
<p align="left">Muhlenberg holds a 34-18-6 series lead, including a 13-4-2 mark in CC contests. The Mules are undefeated (7-0-1) in their last eight meetings with the Bullets, a streak that began in the 2005 CC championship game.</p>

			<p><em>With the College on Fall Break, most of the Muhlenberg student body will be scattered around the Mid-Atlantic region and New England this weekend. So will Mule athletes.</em></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-104" title="Mule Marquee Matchup" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1-300x203.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="203" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1-300x203.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Men&#8217;s Soccer at Franklin &amp; Marshall (Saturday, 3:00)</strong></p>
<p>This is a critical matchup for two teams who were ranked 1-2 in the first regional poll of the season but now find themselves fifth and sixth in the Centennial Conference standings. F&amp;M (9-4, 2-3) is still tied for fifth in the regional rankings, while Muhlenberg (8-3, 3-2) is coming off a win against regionally ranked Drew.</p>
<p>Both teams lost 2-1 to Swarthmore and 1-0 to Haverford. The Diplomats also fell to Johns Hopkins, a team the Mules beat.</p>
<p>Expect a close game: Of F&amp;M&#8217;s 13 games, 10 were decided by one goal, and Muhlenberg has played five straight one-goal games, winning the last three.</p>
<p>F&amp;M leads the all-time series, 29-27-5, but the Mules are 4-0-1 in the last five meetings, including a 4-0 win in the 2010 CC semifinals.</p>

<p><strong>Football vs. Gettysburg (Saturday, 1:00)</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg returns from its bye week looking to snap a two-game losing streak. It won&#8217;t be easy against a potent Gettysburg squad that is 5-0 for the first time since 1987 and is outscoring opponents by an average of 35 points per game.</p>
<p>The Bullets are ranked in the top 15 in Division III in five statistical categories. They are third in rushing offense (326.8 ypg), fourth in scoring defense (8.2 ppg), 10th in scoring offense (43.2 ppg), 13th in total offense (489.2 ypg) and 14th in total defense (247.6 ypg). The Mules (3-2) are 11th in scoring defense (11.4 ppg) and net punting (37.1 yards per punt).</p>
<p>Gettysburg leads the all-time series, 43-32-1, but has not won in Allentown since 1996. The last time the teams played at Scotty Wood Stadium, Muhlenberg needed a last-second saving tackle on a fumble return to win in overtime, 33-27. </p>

<p>Muhlenberg (8-4, 3-3) is one of eight teams with two or three losses in the congested Centennial Conference standings. All of them are chasing Franklin &amp; Marshall (11-1, 6-0), which is ranked fifth in Division III and has won 11 straight since dropping its opener to Elizabethtown.</p>
<p>The Diplomats come in with a streak of six straight shutouts and have allowed only seven goals all season. The only other CC team to allow fewer than 20 is Muhlenberg (15).</p>
<p>F&amp;M leads the all-time series, 13-6-1, and has won the last three. After 4-0 games in 2009 and 2010, last year&#8217;s meeting was closer, with the Diplomats leading 2-1 at halftime and going on to win 3-1.</p>

<p><strong>Women&#8217;s Soccer at Franklin &amp; Marshall (Saturday, 6:00)</strong></p>
<p>One aspect of this matchup would seem to favor the visiting team: Muhlenberg (6-6-1, 4-2) has shut out its last four CC opponents, while F&amp;M (2-4-4, 1-3-2) is the most offensively challenged team in the CC, with only six goals scored in 10 games.</p>
<p>The Mules enter the weekend in a four-way tie for first in the CC with 12 points, although Johns Hopkins and Gettysburg have played one fewer game. The Diplomats made the CC playoffs last season, and although they have struggled this year, they have not allowed more than two goals in a game, and they beat McDaniel, a team to which Muhlenberg lost.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg leads the all-time series, 16-4-1. F&amp;M won last year&#8217;s meeting, 1-0.</p>

<p><strong>Cross Country at Connecticut College Invitational (Saturday); at Lafayette Invitational (Saturday)</strong></p>
<p>The Mules will split up and run in two different meets. The top runners will head to Connecticut for a rare out-of-region meet. In fact, it&#8217;s the Mules&#8217; first meet not in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York or Maryland since they ran at Connecticut College in 1996. For the third straight week, the Muhlenberg women are ranked seventh in the Mideast Region.</p>
<p><strong>Volleyball at Kean Invitational (Friday-Saturday)</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg (12-7) takes a break from CC action and plays in its third and final tournament of the regular season. The Mules&#8217; opponents are Kean (16-6) and Alvernia (9-11) on Friday and Manhattanville (8-16) and NYU-Poly (6-19) on Saturday.</p>

			<p><em>Football is off this weekend, and so is cross country, but all the rest of the fall teams are home for a big weekend of Centennial Conference competition.</em></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-104" title="Mule Marquee Matchup" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1-300x203.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="203" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1-300x203.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Field Hockey vs. Washington College (Saturday, 1:00)</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg (7-3, 3-2), which has matched its combined win total from the last two years, has five CC games remaining &#8211; all but one against teams that qualified for the CC playoffs in 2010 and/or 2011. Washington (5-5, 2-2), the first of those opponents, made the playoffs both years.</p>
<p>Last year, the Shorewomen handed the Mules one of their worst losses, scoring four first-half goals en route to a 5-1 win. Washington leads the all-time series, 11-9.</p>

<p><strong>Volleyball vs. Washington College (Saturday, 12:00); vs. Cedar Crest (Saturday, 4:00)</strong></p>
<p>After falling to 1-3 in the CC with a loss at Dickinson last weekend, Muhlenberg (10-6) rebounded to sweep Bryn Mawr on Wednesday. This is a critical match for the Mules if they are to make a run at the CC playoffs, as their next three league matches are against 2011 playoff qualifiers. Washington (7-10, 2-2) owns a win against one of them, Gettysburg.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg has won 17 of 19 all-time meetings with the Shorewomen, losing only in 1994 and 2010. The Mules are 20-4 all-time against Cedar Crest (8-9), although the two Allentown schools haven&#8217;t faced each other since 2001.</p>

<p><strong>Women&#8217;s Soccer vs. Washington College (Saturday, 4:00)</strong></p>
<p>Just two weeks ago, Muhlenberg was on the verge of being virtually out of the playoff picture, with an 0-2 CC record and games against nationally ranked Johns Hopkins and regionally ranked Dickinson looimng. But the Mules (5-6-1, 3-2) won both of those games and are right in the thick of things &#8211; and their next two games are against teams below them in the standings, including Washington (4-5, 1-3).</p>
<p>Muhlenberg is a perfect 14-0 against the Shorewomen and has outscored them 46-3. Washington&#8217;s last goal against the Mules came in 2003.</p>

<p><strong>Men&#8217;s Soccer vs. Washington College (Saturday, 7:00)</strong></p>
<p>In a span of 44 hours last week, Muhlenberg went from sole possession of first place in the CC to the middle of the pack. Coming off Wednesday&#8217;s non-conference win at TCNJ, the Mules (6-3, 2-2) will try to re-establish themselves as one of the teams to beat in the CC. Washington is 3-5 overall, 2-2 in the CC.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg holds a commanding 22-1-2 series lead, with Washington&#8217;s lone win coming in 2008. Since then, the Mules have posted three straight shutout wins against the Shoremen.</p>

			<p><em>The last time every Muhlenberg team was on the road, two weekends ago, it turned out to be a very successful day, with the Mules going 5-1 at McDaniel. How will the road trips go tomorrow? Here&#8217;s a short preview:</em></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-104" title="Mule Marquee Matchup" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1-300x203.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="203" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1-300x203.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Men&#8217;s Soccer at Haverford (Saturday, 1:00)</strong></p>
<p>The Mules (5-2, 2-1) look to bounce back from last night&#8217;s home loss to Swarthmore with a game against defending Centennial Conference runner-up Haverford (5-4, 2-1). The teams are currently tied for second place in the CC, just a point behind Swarthmore and Dickinson. Haverford&#8217;s lone CC loss was to Johns Hopkins, a team Muhlenberg beat.</p>
<p>The series has been one-sided since the start of CC play, with the Mules winning 17 of 19 meetings. The Fords&#8217; lone series win during that span came in 2001 (the 1998 game ended in a tie). Muhlenberg won 2-0 last year.</p>

<p><strong>Cross Country at Dickinson Long/Short Invitational</strong></p>
<p>It will be the biggest meet of the season to date for both Mule teams, who took first place at Cedar Crest last week. The women, ranked seventh in the region, will compete against two of the teams ranked ahead of them – Dickinson (2) and Elizabethtown (6).</p>

<p><strong>Field Hockey at Dickinson (Saturday, 11:00)</strong></p>
<p>Both of these teams were 5-12 last year. The Mules (5-3, 1-2) have already matched their 2011 win total, and the Red Devils (4-5, 0-3) are just one away. All five of Muhlenberg&#8217;s wins are by one goal, two in overtime, and Dickinson has played a pair of overtime games. Last year the teams played a wild game that came down to the final seconds, with the Mules holding on for a 4-3 win.</p>
<p><strong>Volleyball at Dickinson (Saturday, 11:30)</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg (8-5, 1-2) is looking to get back on the winning track after dropping back-to-back CC matches to Haverford and Johns Hopkins last week. Dickinson (1-11, 0-3) has lost seven straight. The Mules have not won in Carlisle since 2001 but took last year&#8217;s meeting at home, 3-1. </p>
<p><strong>Football at Susquehanna (Saturday, 1:00)</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg (3-1, 2-1) looks to bounce back from its first loss of the season, last week to Johns Hopkins, against a Susquehanna team that, although winless in the Centennial Conference, is still dangerous. The Crusaders (1-3, 0-3) led undefeated Gettysburg in the fourth quarter last week and lead the CC with a plus-8 turnover margin. The Mules are plus-5 themselves and have not turned the ball over in their last 10 quarters.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg leads the series, 11-9, and has won both meetings since Susquehanna joined the CC for football. The Mules travel well, especially on defense &#8211; they&#8217;ve allowed one touchdown or fewer in five of their last eight road games.</p>

<p><strong>Women&#8217;s Soccer at Dickinson, 5:00</strong></p>
<p>This will be Muhlenberg&#8217;s fifth game against an opponent ranked in the top 10 in the region. The Mules (3-6-1, 1-2) beat Johns Hopkins (3t), lost to Messiah (1) by three and suffered one-goal losses to Haverford (3t) and Wilkes (9t). Dickinson (6-2, 1-1), ranked sixth in the region, also lost 1-0 to Haverford and is coming off a 2-0 loss to Messiah. The Red Devils have won the last five series meetings, the last two by a final of 1-0.</p>
<p><strong>Men&#8217;s Tennis at ITA Southeast Regional (Saturday-Sunday); Women&#8217;s Golf at Gettysburg Fall Invitational (Saturday)</strong></p>
