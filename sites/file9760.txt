This weekend, they get their final tuneups.</p>
<p><strong>Men’s Basketball at Ursinus (Saturday, 3:00)</strong></p>
<p>In the CC preseason poll, Franklin &amp; Marshall was picked to finish first, Muhlenberg second and Dickinson third. And even though Dickinson started out 2-4, and Muhlenberg was 4-6 just four weeks ago, that’s exactly the way things could wind up.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-104" title="Mule Marquee Matchup" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1-300x203.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="203" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1-300x203.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>If the Mules (16-8, 10-7) beat the Bears (9-15, 8-9 and out of playoff contention), and Dickinson loses to Franklin &amp; Marshall, Muhlenberg will earn the No. 2 seed and face Dickinson in a CC semifinal next Saturday. If Muhlenberg and Dickinson both win, they will play each other with the Red Devils as the No. 2 seed.</p>
<p>With a loss, the Mules slip to the No. 4 seed, and they would host the loser of the Johns Hopkins-Washington game on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The first pair of Muhlenberg teammates to each score 400 points in a season in 16 years, senior Spencer Liddic and freshman Malique Killing are approaching milestones. Liddic is 22 rebounds away from 1,000, and Killing needs 20 points to break the school freshman record of 419 set by Bob McClure in 1967-68.</p>
<p>Ursinus won the first meeting, 63-61, overcoming a 14-point deficit with 14 minutes to play. The Bears have won the last three regular-season meetings in Collegeville, two in overtime and the other by one point.</p>

<p><strong>Women’s Basketball at Ursinus (Saturday, 1:00)</strong></p>
<p>The Mules are locked into a semifinal playoff game against Franklin &amp; Marshall. They can earn the No. 2  seed with a win and the right combination of other results, but all that impacts is what color jersey they’ll wear in their first playoff game.</p>
<p>There are some team and individual milestones on the horizon. Muhlenberg (19-5, 14-5) will reach the 20-win plateau for the fifth straight year by beating Ursinus. In the College’s athletic history, the only team to post five consecutive 20-win seasons was volleyball (1991-95).</p>
<p>Senior Alexandra Chili, who on Wednesday broke the school record for field goals made by a basketball player (male or female), is within 57 points of the CC career record of 1,965. She hit game-winning last-second shots in two of the three games she’s played at Ursinus.</p>
<p>Ursinus (13-11, 12-7) has clinched a playoff berth but needs a win to secure a first-round home game. The Mules won the first meeting, 72-55, but the Bears are a different team at home, where they are 8-1.</p>

<p><strong>Track &amp; Field at Keogh Invitational (Friday, 5:00)</strong></p>
<p>The Mule teams will try to get a few more athletes qualified for the CC Championships at the site of last year’s conference meet.</p>
<p><strong>Wrestling at Scranton with Johns Hopkins (Saturday, noon)</strong></p>
<p>The wrestlers complete their pre-championship circuit of CC opponents. The Mules are 15-12 in contested matches against CC foes.</p>

			<p>Alexandra Chili has scored more points than any other player in Muhlenberg basketball history (male or female). She became the all-time leading scorer in Mule women&#8217;s basketball history at McDaniel in early January and broke the all-gender mark at Johns Hopkins in late January.</p>
<p>Chili will be returning to her home state of Maryland next weekend for the Centennial Conference Championships and has a shot at becoming the league&#8217;s all-time leading scorer. She has 1,908 points; the record for women is 1,965 and for all players 1,973.</p>
<p>How, when, where and against whom did Chili get her first 1,908 points? Last week, we broke down the <a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/2012/02/07/board-games/">record rebound total </a>for men&#8217;s player Spencer Liddic. Now it&#8217;s time to take a closer look at Chili&#8217;s record point total.</p>
<p>But first, a trivia question: Which team held Chili to the lowest point total in a single game during her career? The surprising answer is at the bottom.</p>

			<p>In honor of Valentine&#8217;s Day, we asked a few of our student-athletes what they LOVE about being a Mule.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/02/lagomarsinohs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-822" title="Ryan Lagomarsino" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/02/lagomarsinohs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Ryan Lagomarsino (Junior, Men&#8217;s Basketball)</strong></p>
<p>First of all I love all of my Lady Mules and the relationships I&#8217;ve been able to build with them. I also love how close everyone on both teams are and how we always seem to have a good time together both on and off the court. Finally, I love the recognition we get off the court and how we always have the best and rowdiest fans, especially for our past few Saturday games. Seeing all of my friends and peers out there supporting us means the world to me.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/02/weisshs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-823" title="Jamie Weiss" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/02/weisshs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Jamie Weiss (Senior, Women&#8217;s Soccer)</strong></p>
<p>Being a student athlete allows you the opportunity to compete. It teaches you time management skills, is a great form of exercise, gives you a strong support system, and you know that you always have a friend. It gives you a great Muhlenberg experience because you get to excel in and out of the classroom setting, and allows you to experience different aspects of college life. Muhlenberg is a great tight-knit community where there are a lot of student fans who come out and support you, which is very nice!</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/02/wilsonhs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-824" title="Bryan Wilson" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/02/wilsonhs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Bryan Wilson (Junior, Football)</strong></p>
<p>The number one thing about being a Muhlenberg student-athlete, and student for that matter, is being able to work out in the Life Sports Center. The facilities are incredible, and I particularly like the fact that the weight room overlooks the football field in order to keep your ultimate goals in sight. I also really like the support staff that we have at Muhlenberg, from the coaches to the equipment room staff to the athletic trainers, and faculty and other students. It truly feels like everyone works together to be successful.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/02/lanzahs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-825" title="Leeann Lanza" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/02/lanzahs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Leeann Lanza (Sophomore, Basketball)</strong></p>
<div>What I love about being a Mule is knowing all of my fellow athletes on campus. Every team is very supportive of the others. I also love the individual team aspect. Coming to college without knowing anyone is a very scary thing and when I came to Muhlenberg as a freshman, I found it extremely easy to transition having 14 automatic friends. It can be like a family, where you&#8217;re doing things with these people all the time. Being a Lady Mule on the women&#8217;s basketball team is such a rewarding experience for me because I have met some of the most amazing people I will ever meet on or off the court. I get really excited when one coaches of the other sports knows who I am too, just because I&#8217;m an athlete. The entire athletics staff as well as professors are so supportive and it is so great to see all of the Muhlenberg pride! I have had many great opportunities through Muhlenberg in academics and athletics and I consider myself so lucky to be a student-athlete here.</div>

<p><strong>Track &amp; Field at Lafayette-Rider Games (Friday, 1:00)</strong></p>
<p>The Mule teams compete at the Armory in their last big meet before the Centennial Conference Championships in two weeks. The track in Manhattan has been very good to the Muhlenberg runners, particularly senior Peter Rice, who broke the school record in the 200 and 400 at this meet last year. He then returned to the Armory eight days later and broke the 400 record again, hitting the NCAA qualifying standard.</p>
<p>Results: <a href="http://www.armorytrack.com/">http://www.armorytrack.com/</a></p>
<p><strong>Basketball doubleheader vs. McDaniel (Saturday, women at 2:00, men at 4:00)</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s rare that individual accomplishments would be put ahead of team goals in basketball, but Alexandra Chili and Spencer Liddic are two rare student-athletes. Unless the Mules qualify to host playoff games, this will be the last time they play at Memorial Hall.</p>
<p>Both have had incredible careers on and off the court. Both were preseason All-Americans and are Centennial Conference all-time leaders in a major statistical category (Chili in three-pointers, Liddic in rebounds). Chili is the all-time leading scorer in Muhlenberg basketball history (men or women); Liddic is likely to move into fourth place tomorrow:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Alexandra Chili, 2009-12 &#8211; 1865 points</strong></li>
<li>Bob McClure, 1968-71 &#8211; 1788 points</li>
<li>Felicia Perryman, 1990-93 &#8211; 1690 points</li>
<li>Dennis Adams, 1991-94 &#8211; 1638 points</li>
<li><strong>Spencer Liddic, 2009-12 &#8211; 1631 points</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Both also were named to the Academic All-District first team recently and are candidates for Academic All-America honors. It is quite remarkable for two student-athletes like this to be at the same school, playing the same sport and in the same class year.</p>
<p>As for the games, both are key for Mule teams in search of playoff berths with three games remaining in the regular season.</p>
<p>The women (17-5, 12-5) are tied for third in the CC and can clinch a playoff spot with a win. They beat McDaniel 77-64 in the first meeting. Although the Green Terror is a little down this year (10-13, 7-11) it is coming off a 76-74 upset of first-place Johns Hopkins and has a history of spoiling Muhlenberg&#8217;s parties, winning three CC playoff games at Memorial Hall in the last 11 years.</p>
<p>The men (14-8, 8-7) are in sole possession of fifth place in a tightly packed CC. Johns Hopkins and Washington are both a game ahead, Haverford and Ursinus (next week&#8217;s opponents for the Mules)both a game back. Muhlenberg came back from an eight-point deficit in the final two minutes to pull out a 71-70 win at McDaniel in January. The Green Terror (7-15, 4-11), which is nationally ranked in scoring defense, has won only two of its last 20 games in Allentown.</p>

			<p>As the end of the season draws closer, the contests grow bigger in importance. And that&#8217;s certainly the case this weekend, with only 15 days left in the regular season.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-104" title="Mule Marquee Matchup" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="237" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg 350w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1-300x203.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" /></a>Men&#8217;s Basketball vs. Franklin &amp; Marshall (Saturday, 4:00)</strong></p>
<p>Franklin &amp; Marshall is 19-1, ranked eighth in Division III and closing in on the top seed for the Centennial Conference playoffs. Muhlenberg is 13-7 and tied for fourth place in the CC, just a game ahead of two other teams with five games to go in the regular season.</p>
<p>While it&#8217;s obviously a big game for the Mules, what makes this the Marquee Matchup is the history of the series. Muhlenberg has five wins against nationally ranked F&amp;M teams at Memorial Hall since the early 1990s, including a 71-67 win last year when the Dips were ranked 19th. The Mules have won nine of the last 14 against F&amp;M at home, and only one of F&amp;M&#8217;s wins was by more than five points.</p>
<p>Then there&#8217;s the presence of two of the &#8220;marquee&#8221; players in the CC. On the league&#8217;s all-time lists, F&amp;M senior Georgio Milligan is second in assists and steals, seventh in scoring and 11th in blocked shots. Muhlenberg senior Spencer Liddic is second in rebounds and double-doubles, 10th in scoring and tied for 16th in blocked shots. He needs 12 rebounds and a double-double to tie the CC all-time marks.</p>

<p><strong>Women&#8217;s Basketball vs. Franklin &amp; Marshall (Saturday, 2:00)</strong></p>
<p>This is a key CC matchup between two teams that are tied for second place in the loss column, two games behind Johns Hopkins. Franklin &amp; Marshall is 14-6 overall, 11-4 in the CC, while Muhlenberg is 15-4, 10-4.</p>
<p>The Mules, who won the first meeting, 62-54, looked like their former selves in beating Swarthmore, 81-46, on Wednesday. The Diplomats are coming off two impressive wins of their own, by 13 points at home vs. Haverford and by 14 points at Washington.</p>
<p>The top three scorers in the CC will be on display in F&amp;M junior Alexa Barbush (17.2 ppg), Muhlenberg senior Alexandra Chili (16.5 ppg) and Muhlenberg junior Alita Zabrecky (15.4 ppg). The Diplomats haven&#8217;t won in Memorial Hall since 2000.</p>

			<p>We had a preview of tonight’s indoor track and field meet in The MuhlBox <a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/?p=751">yesterday</a>. Here’s what to look for on Saturday.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-104" title="Mule Marquee Matchup" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="237" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg 350w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1-300x203.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" /></a>Women’s Basketball at Johns Hopkins, 3:00</strong></p>
<p>The top two teams in the Centennial Conference standings meet for the second time in 13 days. Johns Hopkins (16-2, 11-2) won the first meeting, 76-67.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg (14-3, 9-3) is returning to Baltimore for the first time since winning the CC title there last season. Although it is a trip many fans dread, the Mules have won five of their last seven games at Johns Hopkins (counting one against Gettysburg in last year’s CC playoffs).</p>
<p>Since the league’s inaugural season in 1993-94, these two teams have by far the best record in CC games, and they have combined for 10 titles. Johns Hopkins is 241-59 (.803), Muhlenberg is 233-75 (.756), and the next-best percentage is .648.</p>

<p><strong>Men’s Basketball at Johns Hopkins, 1:00</strong></p>
<p>After snapping a three-game skid with a home win against Haverford on Wednesday, the Mules will look to make it two in a row against the team that handed them the first of their five losses in a six-game span.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg led the first meeting, 38-28, at halftime, but was outscored 47-19 in the second half. Johns Hopkins was 4-1 in the CC after that game but has fallen on hard times since. The Blue Jays are in a three-way tie for third with a 6-5 league mark, one game ahead of Muhlenberg.</p>
<p>The Mules have won their last three games in Baltimore, and the last one they lost (in 2008) was in triple overtime.</p>
<p>Game MVPs will be named for both teams following the game as part of Wall-O’Mahony Alumni Basketball Weekend, named in honor of two former JHU basketball players who died in the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center.</p>

<p><strong>Wrestling at Ursinus with Stevens and Merchant Marine, 12:00</strong></p>
<p>No chance of getting snowed out this week. The Mules finally begin their Centennial Conference dual-meet schedule with a quad match at Ursinus.</p>
<p>Some tough competition awaits: Stevens is ranked 29<sup>th</sup> in Division III, Merchant Marine is the four-time defending CC champion, and Ursinus is undefeated in duals this season.</p>

			<p>On Saturday, the Muhlenberg women’s basketball team trailed Washington by 14 points at halftime and 17 points a minute into the second half, only to come back and win, 60-57.</p>
<p>Incredible? Maybe, but even more remarkable is that it was only the <em>third</em>-best comeback by this year’s senior class.</p>
<p>Three times in the last four years, the Mules have come back to win after trailing on the road by at least 15 points. Asked to rank the three memorable games, three members of the senior class put them in the same order.</p>
<p>Drumroll, please:</p>
<p><strong>1. March 5, 2011 – Muhlenberg 74, Rochester 69.</strong> The Mules trailed 43-26 at halftime in an NCAA Tournament second-round game. (<a href="http://www.muhlenberg.edu/main/athletics/spring11/0305.html">game recap </a>| <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mp84msNln98">video</a>)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Kimberly Mui: </span>Rochester would definitely be number one because of how important this game was. In the first half, we were dominated by Rochester. I actually thought we were going to get blown out and have a miserable five-hour drive home the next day. However, when the second half started and I saw the look in Kelly McKeon&#8217;s eyes, I knew we had a chance.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/01/wbbceleb_rochester.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-744" title="Rochester celebration" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/01/wbbceleb_rochester.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="404" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/01/wbbceleb_rochester.jpg 320w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/01/wbbceleb_rochester-237x300.jpg 237w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /></a>The fact that we beat Rochester on their own court (something that was rarely done in the postseason), down by 17 to take us to the Sweet 16 is something I&#8217;ll never forget. We showed a lot of people that day what we were made of and how much heart we have. At halftime I remember walking by some Rochester students sitting in the stands, and they were laughing at us because of how bad we were doing. I think that sparked a lot of us. Even though I didn&#8217;t play in this game, the excitement and energy of the game made me feel as if I were completely involved.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Kathleen Naddaff:</span> We obviously had a lot more at stake, and a game in the NCAA Tournament means more than a regular-season game. Although I was not able to play in that game because of my ankle, I was right there with the team, and sitting on the bench was probably harder than actually playing in the game.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Katy Rossino:</span> This comeback meant the most to me because of everything that surrounded it. At halftime, the opposing team, coach and fans thought the game was won and we couldn&#8217;t compete with them. But we proved how strong of a team we were in the second half and came back from a large deficit.</p>
<p><strong>2. February 21, 2009 – Muhlenberg 68, Ursinus 65.</strong> The Mules were down by 15 late in the first half and still trailed by 10 with 6:30 left. Alexandra Chili hit the game-winning three-pointer with 1.2 seconds left. (<a href="http://www.muhlenberg.edu/sports/winter09/221page2.html">game recap </a>| <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOJJ0F-n6SE">video</a>)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mui:</span> Ursinus is a close second because of what that win meant to us. It wouldn&#8217;t beat Rochester because it wasn&#8217;t a playoff game, and losing this game wouldn&#8217;t have ended our season. However, with this Ursinus win we became the first women&#8217;s team to ever <a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/01/uccelebrate.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-745" title="Ursinus celebration" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/01/uccelebrate.jpg" alt="" width="345" height="258" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/01/uccelebrate.jpg 345w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/01/uccelebrate-300x224.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 345px) 100vw, 345px" /></a>win 18 conference games and go undefeated. I did not have a good feeling about it, because we were down 10-15 points all game. I remember looking at the clock with about five minutes to go and thinking to myself, &#8220;oh my God, we might actually lose this game.&#8221;</p>
<p>I rarely played my freshman year, so when I got called upon to play defense with about a minute left, I was so nervous. At this point we were only down by two, so I really couldn&#8217;t make a mistake. When I got that steal from their inbounds play, it honestly couldn&#8217;t have been a better feeling. Knowing my steal led to the game-tying basket made me feel on top of the world, especially as a freshman who didn&#8217;t see much floor time. Chili&#8217;s three-pointer was so clutch, and so surreal. That was an incredible win to continue our amazing season. Going undefeated in the conference was an unbelievable feeling and that game is one I will never forget.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Naddaff:</span> It was a really great win because it was the last game we needed to win to remain undefeated in the conference. That was a great feeling and we really pulled together to make that happen.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Rossino:</span> This comeback was exciting because we were freshmen on a team with girls that we looked up to. They were able to use their leadership and experience to bring us back from a game we thought we had lost to go undefeated in the conference.</p>
<p><strong>3. January 21, 2012 – Muhlenberg 60, Washington 57. </strong>(<a href="http://www.muhlenberg.edu/main/athletics/winter12/0121.html">game recap</a>)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mui:</span> Washington comes in third, but it does not make it any less amazing. Since we lost two games this week, this was a big game for us. Washington was hot coming into the game, winning nine of their last 10. If we lost this game, it would be devastating for our morale. Three losses in one week is hard to imagine or comprehend.</p>
<p>When we found ourselves down in the first half, we didn&#8217;t really get into panic mode. I felt as if we were not playing bad, but we were just not hitting shots. If we could get some energy to get us going, I thought we would have a chance to get back into the game.</p>
<p>Coach gave us a longer-than-normal halftime speech, and let us choose what we wanted to do in the second half. We knew that we needed to change the way we were playing and the flow of the game, so we decided to press. Even when we were down by 17 during the second half, I never felt as if we were out of the game. However, coming back and winning on Washington&#8217;s floor felt incredible.</p>
<p>Although this game had no repercussions if we lost, I think this was a turning point in the season. I can&#8217;t predict the future, but this game shows how much heart this team has, and the amount of skill we possess. I think we also showed ourselves what we need to do the rest of the season to be as successful as possible.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Naddaff:</span> It really defined working together and playing as a team. Every single girl on that court was confident in each other, and this year more than others everyone on the team remains completely positive and encouraging. Our bench is amazing and we really do just enjoy playing together and winning as a TEAM.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Rossino:</span> This comeback was a very important win for us. We started off the season great and then had two tough losses. If we had lost Saturday, we would have lost three times in one week. This win taught us that we need to go into every game knowing that the outcome is in our hands, rather than expecting to win games before they even begin.</p>
<p>So how are the Mules able to pull off these comebacks time and again? The seniors have some different theories:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Rossino:</span> Our team is able to make unbelievable comebacks because we like to keep our fans on edge. Another possible explanation could be that we can sometimes start off games flat, and need to have the halftime talk to refocus and figure out what we need to do to win.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Naddaff:</span> Teamwork is really our motto on this team and that is what we do when we need to win &#8211;  we work together and trust each other.  We never give up and we never hang our heads and we try to concentrate on the &#8220;next play&#8221; and work from there. I have honestly never played on a team with so much spirit and<a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/01/wbbhuddlewash.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-746" title="team huddle" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/01/wbbhuddlewash.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="281" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/01/wbbhuddlewash.jpg 400w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/01/wbbhuddlewash-300x210.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></a> so much love for the game. It really is fun when we come back and win because every single girl is a part of that.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mui:</span> I think the one thing about this team that makes these incredible comebacks possible is chemistry and teamwork. We&#8217;re all such good friends off the court, that it translates on the court. We trust each other, and we always want each other to do well. I think that chemistry goes a long way on the basketball court. It can determine the flow and energy of the game, because teammates help bring each other up (or down). Coming from behind to win a game isn&#8217;t all about offense. It requires the team to get stops on defense. During all three of these wins, our team defense was incredible, which led to the spark on offense.</p>

<p>Chili sparked the Mules to a 60-57 come-from-behind win at Washington by scoring 18 of her 21 points in the second half. She netted eight straight points in one 71-second span that took the score from 38-23 to 38-31. Her steal and pass led to free throws that gave Muhlenberg its first lead, and she hit the game-winning basket with 43.1 seconds left. In three games on the week, Chili averaged 16.3 points to hang on to the Centennial Conference scoring lead.</p>

<p>Rice recorded the fastest 200 meters time in the CC so far this year, running a 23.09 at the Lehigh Multi and Invite. He also anchored the 4&#215;400 relay team that posted the fastest time in the CC to date and came within 0.05 seconds of the school record in the 60 meters.</p>

			<p>It&#8217;s the first Saturday of the winter season in which all five Muhlenberg teams are scheduled to compete &#8230; and it&#8217;s supposed to snow. Here&#8217;s what to look for if everything goes on as scheduled:</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-104" title="Mule Marquee Matchup" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="237" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg 350w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1-300x203.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" /></a>Basketball doubleheader at Washington (Saturday, women at 2, men at 4)</strong></p>
<p>Chestertown will be the site for two pivotal games in the Centennial Conference standings.</p>
<p>The 14th-ranked Muhlenberg women (13-2, 8-2) will try to keep pace with Johns Hopkins (a half-game ahead in the CC) against a Washington team that is having an outstanding season. The Shorewomen (11-5, 6-5) have won nine of their last 10, with their only loss coming at Johns Hopkins.</p>
<p>Washington gave the Mules a tough battle when the teams met in Allentown in early December. Muhlenberg had a 15-point second-half lead slashed to five before holding on for a 71-63 victory.</p>
<p>The Mules lead the all-time series 32-4, but their only series loss in the last 16 years came in the 2006-07 season in Chestertown when they were nationally ranked (23rd).</p>
<p>In the men&#8217;s standings, it is Muhlenberg (10-5, 4-5) that is looking up at Washington (10-6, 6-3). The Shoremen won their last two games on the road against teams that handed the Mules their two biggest losses of the season (Franklin &amp; Marshall and Johns Hopkins).</p>
<p>Muhlenberg hasn&#8217;t had much success at the Cain Center, winning just four times in 19 trips since the start of CC play in 1994. Then again, Washington hadn&#8217;t won in Allentown since 1989 before pulling out a 96-93 victory in overtime in the first meeting this season.</p>

<p><strong>Indoor Track &amp; Field at Lehigh Multi &amp; Invite (Saturday, 11:00)</strong></p>
<p>After getting their feet wet at Kutztown last week, the Mules will start to get more of a feel of where they stand in their second meet of the season. The teams are improving the level of competition (at a Division I meet) and the quality of the facility (they will be allowed to wear spikes), which should make for faster times.</p>
<p>Several athletes who did not compete at Kutztown will make their season debuts, and the women will line up 4&#215;400 and 4&#215;800 relay teams.</p>
<p><strong>Wrestling at Gettysburg with Johns Hopkins (Saturday, 12:00)</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg kicks off its Centennial Conference dual-meet season with a tri-match at Gettysburg. Although the Mules do not have enough wrestlers to be successful in dual meets, the individual bouts are important for seeding at the CC Championships.</p>
