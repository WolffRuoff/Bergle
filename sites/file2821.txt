								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Morabito, Andrea. (2011, Feb. 7). <em>Broadcasting &amp; Cable. </em>Retrieved from <a href="http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/463581-Super_Bowl_XLV_is_Most_Watched_TV_Program_Ever.php" target="_blank">http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/463581-Super_Bowl_XLV_is_Most_Watched_TV_Program_Ever.php</a>.</p>
<p>Super Bowl XLV last Sunday February 6, was the most watched television show in U.S. history. The game averaged 111 million total views. This beat last year’s Super Bowl’s record of 106.5 million spectators. The Super Bowl always rakes in extreme high numbers of viewers and for the past four years has set a viewership records.</p>
<p>            After the Super Bowl, an episode of <em>Glee</em> aired from 10:30 to 11:45 p.m. 26.8 million people watched increasing its total viewers 17% from its weekly average.<em> Glee’s</em> numbers were bigger than the episode of <em>The Office</em> that followed 2009’s Super Bowl. However, last year’s post Super Bowl’s episode of <em>Undercover Boss</em> drew bigger numbers than both <em>Glee </em>and The <em>Office.<span id="more-769"></span></em></p>
<p>            We suspect that the broad audience of a reality television show would lure in more viewers than a musically based high school sitcom. This makes us think about the idea of public interest and why Fox chose such a special interest show that does not seem to fit the same audience as the Super Bowl. An event like the Super Bowl can unite all different ages and demographics showing the positive possibilities for television. When Fox chooses to show a program like <em>Glee</em>, we feel the network has other motives in mind besides the public interest. Were they trying to attract a broader audience to increase network’s long term viewership? Was Fox trying to piggy back off of the popularity of the Super Bowl to increase <em>Glee’s</em> fan base? While <em>Glee</em> has proved its success, we feel that a show like <em>Undercover Boss</em> which has a wider appeal may have been a better fit for the Super Bowl’s audience’s actual desires and interests. This brings us back to the power relationship between the network heads and the audience. Networks don’t necessarily have to give audiences what may be best but instead they focus on what may be most lucrative, ultimately choosing their rising star, <em>Glee</em>. While traditional all-American football fans may not always mix with musical theater lovers, with Fox has anything to say about it, they will.</p>
