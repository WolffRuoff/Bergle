And why should they when the DVR makes it so easy to avoid them?  But the Turner Company, a cable unit owned by the media conglomerate Time Warner, is developing a new strategy to save commercials from falling to their death (ouch!).  The company has undergone a four year effort to create a new kind of advertising strategy that will offer advertisers on the cable networks TBX, TNT, and True something that many others do not: a strong link between the commercial and the TV show that the consumers are viewing. The goal of this effort is to bring consumers back to commercials by making these ads relevant to the specific program and the specific audience.</p>
<p>Turner’s idea is similar to a technique that other networks have come up with, the technique of embedding show content within the commercial breaks.  We saw American Idol trying out this strategy with their “embedded auditions” that ran between commercials.  Networks and advertisers hoped that when viewers saw a flash of that familiar American Idol logo, they would stop fast-forwarding to see the show content, and, with any luck, see some other ads in the process.<span id="more-1155"></span></p>
<p>But the Turner Company’s strategy is a little different: instead of embedding show content into commercial breaks, the company proposes that advertisers work with Turner to create commercials that look or feel like a particular TV program, even though these spots are not actual show content.  The first step in this strategy is to identify particular moments or themes from the TV show that would seem to resonate with audiences or that serve as clear representations of the program.  The Turner Company uses the phrase “tagging” to describe the specific moments or themes that can be integrated into the commercials that will be viewed when the movie or television series is airing. Tuner Company’s thinking behind this tactic is that if the audience watches the television show or series, they must enjoy these themes or moments; therefore if these “tagged” themes are integrated into the commercials when the particular show or series is airing, consumers will be more likely to enjoy and watch the commercials.  So, if this strategy catches on, a company might develop an ad that features an attractive blonde singing in front of a panel of three (probably multi-racial/gender) judges to air during American Idol—it may not be an actual American Idol audition, but it looks like one, so audiences may be more inclined to watch the commercial.</p>
<p>Turner Company has hired several new employees to “tag” specific moments and themes in television series in the hopes of revamping television commercials. An inside source estimates that this new endeavor will cost Turner about a seven-figure sum amount. Linda Yaccarino, Vice President of Turner Entertainment ad sales states, “Such moves are absolutely critical to survival.”  This situation speaks to the enormous power of the client power role, or advertisers.   Turner, a cable distributor, is desperate to make TV attractive for advertisers, as cable networks rely largely on advertisers to make a profit.   As more and more consumers turn to online forms of media, television networks have to compete for advertiser dollars.  We have seen how this has impacted the print industries, which have either faltered or have been forced to go digital as a result of audience erosion and the resulting loss of advertisers.  The Turner Company does not want to suffer the same fate, so it is actively developing new ways to make its TV networks the hot place to advertise.  Plus, this new technique reflects the trend of audience segmentation: advertisers have always chosen to advertise during programs that draw an audience that would be interested in their products, but now there is even more of an opportunity to target an audience through an ad that is tailor-made for a specific audience.</p>
<p>It’s always a little troubling when the line between content creation and advertising gets blurred.  Turner’s mission is to help create commercials that complement television content, but it’s not a stretch to say that this relationship could become reciprocal with television creators creating content that complements commercials.  Or, television creators might be encouraged to dumb down their content so that it will be easier for advertisers to recycle this content in the form of an ad.</p>
<p>But with the incredible commercial zapping capability of DVRs, will the audiences even notice the change in commercials? Yaccarino is hopeful, stating, “A viewer could be ‘zooming through’ with a DVR, but if the advertising looks like the content the viewer tuned in to see in the first place, they may be trained to stop and watch it.” What are we dogs? We will see.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: small;font-family: Calibri">Rubino L., (2011, April 5). Lexus, KitchenAid, Chase Sapphire To Sponsor Bravo’s ‘Top Chef Masters.’ Broadcasting and Cable, Retrieved from <a href="//www.broadcastingcable.com/article/466349-Lexus_KitchenAid_Chase_Sapphire_To_Sponsor_Bravo_s_Top_Chef_Masters_.php">http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/466349-Lexus_KitchenAid_Chase_Sapphire_To_Sponsor_Bravo_s_Top_Chef_Masters_.php</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;font-family: Calibri">The third season of <em>Top Chef Masters</em> gains new sponsors. Bravo has announced Lexus, KitchenAid, and Chase Sapphire will donate a total of 250,000 to various charities throughout the season. Along with donating to charities these prestigious companies will have a plethora of in-show product integration including equipment used by contestants and the cars that drive them each episode. Not only will these products be used on the show, the companies will give out prizes to the chefs who win challenges, the grand prize of $100,000 to the show’s winner, and prizes to on line fans who compete in games through the Bravo TV website. Aside from these three major companies Bravo has made a deal with <em>New York</em> magazine to feature a <em>Top Chef Masters</em> exclusive section on its website.<span id="more-1090"></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;font-family: Calibri"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small"><span style="font-family: Calibri">These partnerships provide a bevy of advertising opportunities that are not just limited to commercials. With the increase of on line and DVR viewership networks like Bravo have to increasingly become more creative in the way they highlight their sponsors. Bravo uses the internet as a linking pin between its fans and the show by providing not only the television content but also interactive games and contests. Advertisers see this as another way to market their products to not only people watching the show, but people using the internet. Not only are these big money corporations trying to sell a product, they are working hard to exude a good public image; through their multiple donations throughout the season they will be extending their services to more than just fans and competitors. KitchenAid and Lexus not only fill the investor power role but also serve as an auxiliary role for Bravo and <em>Top Chef Masters</em>. This is beneficial for the show because not only do they gain much needed sponsorship funds, they also are saving money by having their advertisers fit the Top Chef kitchens with everything a gourmet chef could dream of. With the shows increased popularity Bravo has stepped up their game, moving on from their former Toyota sponsorship and on to a luxury brand like Lexus.  </span></span></p>

<p>Remember getting up early on Saturda<img class="alignleft" src="http://www.flowersbyvalerie.com/images/FBVED007.jpg" alt="" width="144" height="122" />y mornings to watch cartoons?  You undoubtedly remember such classics as <em>Recess </em>and <em>Pepper Ann</em>, but you probably also remember those bright, flashy advertisements for products like Gushers, Dunkaroos, and Kraft Mac and Cheese.  However, there have been some changes regarding food and drink advertising aimed towards kids.  After years of scrutiny from the FCC, 17 advertisers, including Burger King and Kraft, have not only improved the health content of their products, but have also changed their marketing strategies.  This agreement is called the Children’s Food and Beverage Advertising Initiative and is a creation of the Council of Better Business Bureaus.  In 2007, these advertisers pledged to promote healthy products in at least half of their media targeted to children.  In January 2010, promoting healthy products during kids’ ad times became an official requirement for businesses that are part of the Council of Better Business Bureaus.  Furthermore, major junk-food companies like Coca-Cola and Hershey have made it their policy to not advertise to children under the age of twelve.</p>
<p><span id="more-980"></span></p>
<p>Why would these companies volunteer to cut down its advertisers to its most eager customers?  It’s probably not because they’re worried about the dental hygiene of America’s youth.  More likely, it’s because these food companies want to avoid government regulation.  If these companies change their programming strategies, they can keep the FCC, playing the authority power role, from imposing its own rules.</p>
<p>We should also consider the role of the Council of Better Business Bureaus, the committee responsible for establishing these new protocols for kids’ food and drink advertising.  Though the BBB theoretically functions as a facilitator that encourages upright business practices and tells consumers which businesses are operating fairly, many have questioned the BBB’s cozy relationship with the very companies that it is supposed to be monitoring.  As businesses pay to be part of the BBB, the council has a strong interest in keeping these businesses happy. If the BBB comes out with strong criticisms against a powerful business, this business could stop participating in the BBB, taking with it its crucial resource: money.  Therefore, it seems unlikely that the BBB was interested in looking out for the health of young TV fans, and more likely that it was trying to assist the businesses that it depends on for its own survival.  For more on the questionable BBB practices, check out this <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2009/jan/21/business/fi-lazarus21">LA Times article</a>.</p>
<p>Another strategy that food and drink companies have taken to avoid FCC regulations is to shift the target of the advertisements from kids to their parents.  Daytime broadcast programming has benefitted from this shift, as advertisers know that this is when some parents (including stay at home moms) watch TV.  Additionally, these advertisers have become more interested in the traditional primetime hours (especially 8pm) as this is a time when both parents and kids watch TV together.  Now more than ever, advertisers are willing to pay a lot for these times slots, which, in turn, encourages the networks to expand their family friendly primetime programming.  This is an example of the advertiser’s, or client’s, ability to influence the types of shows that networks, or producers, create and air.</p>
<p>This example shows the lengths that TV advertisers will go to in order to avoid government regulation.  By making some concessions and shifting their target audience, America’s food and drink companies can both evade strict government rules, and, at the same time, continue to create new generations of French fry fiends and soda slurpers.</p>

(March 22, 2011). P&amp;G, Best Buy, Google, EA, Twitter Headline Ad Age&#8217;s Digital Conference April 6-7. Retrieved March 25, 2011 from <a href="http://adage.com/article/digital/p-g-google-ea-headline-ad-age-digital-conference-april-6-7/149513/">http://adage.com/article/digital/p-g-google-ea-headline-ad-age-digital-conference-april-6-7/149513/</a></p>
<p>On April 6th &amp; 7th, AdAge will facilitate the fifth annual Digital Conference, “where marketers, publishers, agency executives, digital strategists, creative technologists and Internet entrepreneurs will share their visions for the digital and emerging media landscape, along with their stories of what&#8217;s working and what&#8217;s not.” This year’s conference headlines the burgeoning relationship between the video-gaming industry, online social media services and mobile platforms.<br />
<span id="more-976"></span><br />
Social Media platforms have found many new and innovative ways to generate profits. Twitter’s Promoted Tweets platform that currently allow major advertisers to get their ‘160 Characters of Fame’ when their tweets show up on users twitter feeds.  At the conference, Twitter’s President of Global Revenues will show the monetization structure of the platform and discuss future paid advertising opportunities.</p>
<p>Another important up-and-coming industry that will be discussed at the conference is the new social shopping and group-buying companies like Groupon and Living Social. These companies act as distributors and exhibitors for either local or national companies to push out deals to consumers who can get discounts if their is a certain predetermined number of users who express interest opt in.</p>
<p>Consumer demand has shifted industry focus from a console-game model to a multi-platform model utilizing the Internet (with services such as Xbox Live and the PlayStation Network). The shift has developed new revenue sources while creating an experience driven by social interaction. Revenue models have expanded to include more transactions after the initial purchasing of the game, making the experience more engaging and longer lasting. The shift dilutes the distribution power of traditional game-consoles, as new platforms emerge as distribution channels for video-gaming.</p>
<p>Additionally, social platforms, especially Facebook, have seen great profits from the implementation of their gaming platform.  Games Like Mafia Wars, the Oregon Trail, and Farmville, have built up major followings, and only allow users a limited number of moves within a set time period, which can be extended if users are willing to pay, which surprisingly a great number of people are. Here, we see the shifting creator and producer power roles, as small application developers can create a prolific number of new applications at low cost, a parallel to the traditional economic boom/bust model in media industries.</p></div>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bruno, A. (16 March 2011). MTV launches Hive website, latest effort to refocus on music. <em>Billboard</em>. Retrieved from <a href="http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/industry/digital-and-mobile/mtv-launches-hive-website-latest-effort-1005075732.story#">http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/industry/digital-and-mobile/mtv-launches-hive-website-latest-effort-1005075732.story#</a></p>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/photos/stylus/1037809-MTV-Hive.png" alt="" width="200" height="140" />The empty acronym formerly known as Music Television (MTV) debuted a new website this week that focuses on…music. The new site, called “<a href="http://www.mtvhive.com/">Hive</a>,” will feature music videos, interviews, book reviews by artists, polls, music popularity tracking meters, and editorials by the company’s top executives. It appears to represent an effort by MTV to reinvent its image after recent Reality- show scandals, including a child pornography investigation surrounding its shock-schlock show <em>Skins</em>.</p>
<p><span id="more-955"></span></p>
<p>MTV wasn’t always a Reality TV depot. At its peak, MTV was one of the most important exhibitors in the music industry. Eighties and nineties kids often heard new music for the first time on the network’s popular request shows, and MTV’s decision to promote or marginalize a new artist could make or break a recording company’s profits for an entire year. The network also transformed the music video into a form of mass media, forcing the labels to dump millions of dollars a year into producing high-quality and catchy videos for audiences.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, over a decade after jumping onto the Reality TV bandwagon, MTV apparently wants to recapture some of its former image (and power). The network will exhibit music on the site, with a section for users to access new and vintage music videos and buy MP3s. Alongside the actual music will be polls that track users’ opinions of new artists, videos that feature <a href="http://www.mtvhive.com/playlists/76BA27020227BA7600010227BA76/mgid:playlist:video:mtvmusic.com:71585">sometimes bizarre</a> consumer reviews of music videos, and a feature called <a href="http://www.mtvmusicmeter.com/">Music Meter</a>, which claims to track an artists’ popularity on social media and downloading sites. MTV’s many Top Ten countdowns and on-air VJ reviews made it a facilitator for the music industry since its inception, and network executives are clearly hoping to carry that role online. To help with the transition, the network is bringing in veteran music industry linking pin Jessica Robertson, who helped <em><a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/">Rolling Stone</a> </em>and <em><a href="http://www.spinner.com/">Spinner</a></em> digitize and re-format their content for the Internet age.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In some ways, it’s surprising that MTV waited so long to overhaul its website. This is the network that has exploited almost every synergistic media connection possible, from television series to a movie division. Now that MTV is finally ready to “flex some music muscles,” as network president Van Toffler says, it may already be too late. MTV’s core demographic, the teen to twenties group, has been getting MP3s and music news online from sources that look suspiciously like MTV’s new website, including <a href="http://www.billboard.com/#/">Billboard</a>, for over a decade. Hive will have to include some outstanding features to draw users away from their established online music outlets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One notable feature of the site is the complete lack of traditional “advertising.” Of course, that’s largely because the site is one big advertisement for all artists whose labels have made deals with MTV to sell merchandise, concert tickets, and MP3s on the site, along with other promotion deals. In fact, the same criticisms that the network faced at its peak are likely to carry over to the new website. For years, critics argued that MTV was the prime homogenization force in the music industry, squeezing out smaller artists whose indie labels couldn’t pay to make high-profile deals with the network. It’s not hard to imagine that any concert tickets or merchandise sold on Hive won’t be for your local neighborhood ska band’s next gig. It’s not really that MTV doesn’t like indie artists. MTV has a bottom line to worry about, and music and promotion deals with Sony and EMI are more likely to increase it than smaller labels.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, it’s not really MTV doing all these things at all. MTV is actually owned by <a href="http://www.viacom.com/Pages/default.aspx">Viacom</a>, a massive media conglomerate that owns a number of television channels (including Nickelodeon) and a diversified portfolio of other media holdings. Viacom is interested in promoting the same content across multiple channels and making deals with reliable companies who they know will follow through on their commitments. Large national corporations don’t necessarily have time to deal with the eccentric smaller indie labels. MTV probably initially jumped into bed with Viacom because it couldn’t afford to do that, either. Like most things, it all comes down to money.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MTV apparently hopes to offer more local music listings and services in the future, but there’s no trace of those features on Hive. As the Internet becomes the primary exhibition and distribution outlet for music, corporations like MTV that specialize in music may eventually have to “own the local” in much the same way newspapers and radio stations had to with the advent of television. It’s too early to tell whether Hive will allow MTV to re-enter some of its former power roles in the music industry. Given Viacom’s financial backing, however, the network certainly has a fighting chance.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lafayette, J.  (2011, February 1). MTV’s ‘Skins’ Continues Ratings Slide Except with Teens.  <em>Broadcasting &amp; Cable</em>. Retrieved from <a href="http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/463300-MTV_s_Skins_Continues_Ratings_Slide_Except_with_Teens.php">http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/463300-MTV_s_Skins_Continues_Ratings_Slide_Except_with_Teens.php</a>.</p>
<p>The new MTV show <em><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=skins+us+trailer&amp;aq=f">Skins</a>,</em> a program that depicts (quite explicitly) “the sex and drug habits of teens,” is already facing pressure from audiences and advertisers, even though the show has only aired three episodes.  Although MTV aims its programming towards the 12-34 year old demographic, <em>Skins</em> has been wildly popular with 12-17 year olds (omg!), which is troubling for many parents.  One major media advocacy organization, The Parents Television Council, labeled <em>Skins</em> the “’&#8217;most dangerous show&#8217; on TV for children.&#8221;  Even Viacom, which owns MTV, has acknowledged these concerns, suggesting the show may, in fact, violate child pornography laws.  This negative attention has also worried advertisers, many of whom have opted to remove their advertisements from MTV during <em>Skins&#8217; </em>time slot.</p>
<p><span id="more-731"></span>The outcry over <em>Skins</em> complicates that old media adage that sex sells.  <em>Skins</em>’ racy content has upset public advocacy groups, which have significant power to shape television programming.  While we often think of government regulation as the key way to address questionable media content, this example suggests that public advocacy organizations can also be effective by encouraging media producers to self-regulate.  As a public advocacy group, the PTC has the ability to draw negative attention to <em>Skins</em>, increasing the likelihood that other parents will think twice before allowing their own kids to watch the program.  Plus, networks know that if they fail to listen to advocacy groups&#8217; concerns, these groups can turn to the government to secure mandated content regulation.   These two resources, publicity and the threat of government-regulation, give advocacy groups like the PTC an edge when dealing with media producers like MTV, and could very well persuade MTV to dial back on <em>Skins</em>&#8216; adult content.</p>
<p>In addition to the PTC, many advertisers have also objected to<em> Skins</em>.  Not wanting to be associated with an increasingly stigmatized show, General Motors, Taco Bell, Schick, Subway, Wrigley, and H&amp;R Block have all removed their ads during <em>Skins</em>’ time slot.  Other sponsors who had secured product placement deals with MTV, including Clearasil, are also considering withdrawing their involvement with <em>Skins. </em>So, advertisers, which fill the power role of client, can also use their resources to motivate television networks to self-regulate their content.   When a client like Subway withdraws its ads from MTV during <em>Skins</em>&#8216; time slot, this is an example of a client exercising its power, or strategically withholding its resources.  As television networks rely on money from advertisers, MTV, again, has an interest in self-regulating its controversial material in order to hold onto advertisers and the money that they control.</p>
<p>Whether you think the uproar over <em>Skins</em> represents a move towards a sensible solution or senseless censorship, one thing’s for sure: the <strong>ombudspeople</strong> at MTV must be very busy.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Herrera, M. (31 January 2011). Eminem to star in Super Bowl claymation ad: Report.  <em>Billboard</em>.  Retrieved from <a href="http://www.billboard.com/search/?keyword=eminem#/news/eminem-to-star-in-super-bowl-claymation-1005016312.story">http://www.billboard.com/search/?keyword=eminem#/news/eminem-to-star-in-super-bowl-claymation-1005016312.story</a></p>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://imagecache.blastro.com/images/feat/eminem.jpg" alt="" width="181" height="113" /></p>
<p>Lipton Brisk Iced Tea has a treat for Super Bowl ad enthusiasts this year: Eminem in Claymation! The rapper allegedly landed an appearance in Lipton’s $1 million ad spot, set to air during the February 6th game, which features a clay version of him going through “a day in the life” of a superstar. The Claymation theme harks back to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-g8opm1ZmY&amp;playnext=1&amp;list=PL3AEE3D248A17A481">a classic Lipton ad campaign that once featured Frank Sinatra</a>.</p>
<p><span id="more-719"></span></p>
<p>Eminem’s participation in the ad reveals the continuing attempts at synergy between the sound recording industry and the television advertising departments of major companies like Lipton. It especially represents the sound recording industry’s attempt to nab its own piece of the Super Bowl revenue pie. Advertisers realized long ago that the Super Bowl’s ability to reach multiple demographics—a rare ability indeed in this era of fragmented cable audiences—makes the mega-million-dollar ad spaces worth the price. The sound recording industry, in turn, can exploit the advertisers’ need for celebrity endorsements to give their ads that extra pizazz. Clay Eminem drinks some clay tea for Lipton and Lipton gets Eminem (and his new album) in front of the 18-34 audience. Everyone wins. This has been going on since (and long before) <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8qtsUaoVak&amp;feature=related">Madonna teamed up with Pepsi during the 1980s to release her “Like a Prayer” video</a>. The fact that everyone remembers that ad testifies to the strategy’s potential.</p>
<p>Lurking somewhere behind all these joint sound recording-television ventures is a person or persons who are serving what Turow would call “linking pin” roles. These are the people who try to “link” someone or something from one medium (in this case, sound recording) to another (in this case, television). Since Eminem owns his own record label, he’s almost certainly in full promo mode for his new album, <em>Relapse</em>, through traditional sound recording channels like radio and new ones like iTunes. However, the Super Bowl ad offers a vastly expanded audience and possibly access to new TV-watching fans. In the new Information Age, artists who <em>don’t</em> venture into media outside of their industries are already behind.</p>
<p>Indeed, Eminem’s “linking pins” (which may include himself) have been hard at work even outside of preparing a Super Bowl ad appearance. In addition to television, he’s apparently eying a film role in an upcoming DreamWorks picture.</p>
<p>Why all this branching out in the music industry? While recording artists are no strangers to working within the television and film worlds, some of the recent expansion into other media may reflect concerns about illegal downloading. New file sharing outfits seem to pop up faster than the record labels can file lawsuits against them. The possibility of decreasing profit potential within the traditional sound recording industry may motivate artists like Eminem to explore work in other media industries and to seek new advertising opportunities.</p>
<p>Only time will tell how successful these explorations will be for the future of the sound recording industry.</p>
