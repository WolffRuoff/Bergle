In essence, such an open access policy encourages faculty to explore placing their research in journals that support free public access to their articles. Typically this means some type of negotiation at the time of signing on with a publisher, allowing the author to retain the right to post his\/her research to a personal website or institutional repository.<\/p>\n<p>Today, the\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/chronicle.com\/blogs\/wiredcampus\/princeton-u-adopts-open-access-policy\/33450?sid=at&amp;utm_source=at&amp;utm_medium=en\">Chronicle of Higher Education<\/a>\u00a0reported on the most recent addition, Princeton University, to the list of institutions adopting a policy of open access publishing. The report gives a nice overview of what such a policy means.<\/p>\n<p>Interested in learning more about open access policies?
