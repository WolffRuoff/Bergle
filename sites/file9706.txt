			<p>In averaging 452 yards and 45 points through the first three games of the 2014 season, the Muhlenberg football team has shown great chemistry on offense: between the quarterback and receivers, between the running backs and offensive line, and between the linemen themselves.</p>
<p>It helps that two of the veteran starters on the line know a thing or two about chemistry.</p>
<p>Juniors Bryan Auvil (right tackle) and Andrew Kincaid (center) are not only third-year starters on the offensive line, but they are both chemistry majors who spent this past summer doing research on campus. Both presented their projects at Muhlenberg’s Summer Research Poster Session last Friday.</p>

<p>“It was pretty awesome that we were both on campus doing research,” said Kincaid. “We got to work out together, and that definitely helped us prepare for the season.”</p>
<p>Auvil was mentored by Dr. Sherri Young for his project, “Synthesis of Peptoids to be Used as Blood-Brain Barrier Shuttles.” Here is how he described it:</p>

<p>“The goal of our project is to modify NSAIDs to increase their membrane penetrability. We plan to do this by linking NSAIDs to small peptoids (similar to peptides) that should be able to act as a shuttle to carry the drug across the blood-brain barrier.  I spent most of my summer developing a method to synthesize and purify these peptoids. “</p>

<p>“I studied the surface tension between the major component of orange oil and water,” he explained. “Learning about the surface tension of these oils allows us to make emulsions. Emulsions allow water and oils that usually shouldn&#8217;t mix to do exactly that. This is very useful in creating fragrances.”</p>
<p>Kincaid recalled that he and Auvil got plenty of comments about how different it was to have two football players in the lab during the summer. And by trading in their helmets and pads for goggles and lab coats, they may have lent credence to the notion that, because of the complex blocking schemes they have to learn, offensive linemen are among the smartest players on a football team.</p>
<p>“You can print that!” said Auvil with a laugh.</p>

<p>Auvil, meanwhile, plans to go to medical school and was happy to find an organic chemistry-type project that has a medical application.</p>
<p>Both Muhlenberg student-athletes relished the experienc<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2390" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/09/auvil_block-214x300.jpg" alt="Bryan Auvil" width="214" height="300" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/09/auvil_block-214x300.jpg 214w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/09/auvil_block.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 214px) 100vw, 214px" />e as they do springing a back for a long run.</p>
<p>“The research is an awesome experience as an undergraduate, especially coming out of sophomore year,” said Auvil <em>(right)</em>. “At larger schools, usually the graduate students do the research.”</p>
<p>“It’s awesome that we go to a place where we have all these opportunities,” added Kincaid. “To be able to do research in the summer and then play football in the fall … I’m pretty grateful for that.”</p>

</em></p>
<p><strong>Field Hockey at McDaniel (Friday, 7:00)</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg (4-1) begins its quest for a second consecutive playoff berth with a trip to Maryland. The Mules come in with a four-game winning streak and have allowed only three goals &#8211; tied for the fewest in the CC &#8211; in five games.</p>
<p>McDaniel (4-2) brings a three-game winning streak into its CC opener. The Green Terror has not made the playoffs since 2006 and had a 3-7 CC record &#8211; its worst since 1999 &#8211; last year.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg leads the all-time series, 12-9, and has won the last two meetings. The last game played in Westminster was a wild back-and-forth affair in which the Mules came from behind twice before winning, 4-3 in overtime.</p>

<p><strong>Volleyball vs. McDaniel (Saturday, 12:00); vs. Cedar Crest (Saturday, 4:00)</strong></p>
<p>Fresh off its win against defending CC regular-season champion Franklin &amp; Marshall on Wednesday, Muhlenberg hops right back into the fire against a McDaniel team that it faced &#8211; and beat &#8211; in the CC semifinals last year.</p>
<p>The Mules (11-2) have won four in a row and lead the CC in kills per set (11.89), hitting percentage (.254), assists per set (11.09) and points per set (16.2). McDaniel (9-2), coming off a five-set loss to 13-1 Catholic, is the top blocking team in the CC, averaging 2.11 blocks per set.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg leads the all-time series, 15-8, and has won the last four meetings, including both last year.</p>
<p>The final match of the day pits Muhlenberg against 1-6 Cedar Crest. A win against McDaniel would put the Mules at 2-0 in the CC for the first time since 2002. A sweep would give them their best record (13-2) through 15 matches since 1993.</p>

<p><strong>Men&#8217;s Soccer vs. McDaniel (Saturday, 4:00)</strong></p>
<p>This is one of five games that open the 2014 CC men’s soccer season, and the early non-league results point to a highly competitive campaign ahead. CC teams have combined for an outstanding 42-12-4 (.759) record so far and occupy seven of the 10 spots in the NSCAA regional rankings released earlier this week.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg is looking to return to the playoffs after two years away, while McDaniel is seeking its first CC playoff berth since 2005.</p>
<p>The Mules (4-0-1) bring an unscored-upon streak of 428 minutes into the game; through Wednesday’s games, they were one of only nine teams in Division III to have played at least five games and allowed fewer than two goals. McDaniel (5-1) counters with the CC leader in goals and points.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg has won the last nine meetings to extend its series lead to 33-7-1, but seven of those nine games were decided by a single goal, including a 1-0 match last year in which the goal was not scored until the 72nd minute. The Green Terror’s last series win came in 2001 in the semifinals of the CC playoffs.</p>

<p><strong>Women&#8217;s Soccer vs. McDaniel (Saturday, 7:00)</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg and Bryn Mawr got the jump on the 2014 CC season last Thursday, but for the other nine teams in the league, Saturday is Opening Day. Of the five games scheduled, this is the only one featuring two teams that made the playoffs last year.</p>
<p>CC teams have done very well in non-league games, combining for a 38-19-4 (.656) record and placing five teams &#8211; including these two &#8211; in the regional top 10.</p>
<p>The first goal could win the game, as both of these teams have been very stingy. McDaniel has given up just one goal all season and Muhlenberg only two.</p>
<p>The Green Terror (5-0-1 and ranked ninth in the region) brings in a scoreless streak of 473 minutes. The Mules (5-0-1 and ranked 10th in the region) have set a school record for longest unbeaten streak to start a season and are coming off a very strong performance in a 1-1 tie against Lebanon Valley (ranked eighth in the region).</p>
<p>Muhlenberg holds a 14-6-2 series lead and has suffered only two losses to McDaniel since 1997. The teams met twice last year, with the Mules winning the regular-season meeting, 1-0. In the first round of the CC playoffs, the teams played to a scoreless draw, and Muhlenberg won the shootout to advance to the semifinals.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.muhlenberg.edu/sports/wsoclive/xlive.htm">Live stats</a> | <a href="http://portal.stretchinternet.com/muhlenberg/">Live video</a></p>
<p><strong>Football at McDaniel (Saturday, 2:00)</strong></p>
<p>There was a time when the trip to Westminster was a dreaded one for the Mules: From 1990 to 2006, they lost nine straight games there. But the last three trips have been much more fruitful: three Muhlenberg wins by a combined score of 111-6.</p>
<p>The Mules (2-0) have won eight consecutive regular-season games and came within three minutes of opening a season with back-to-back shutouts for only the second time in 66 years last week.</p>
<p>McDaniel (1-1) is a building program that improved from 0-10 in 2012 to 2-8 last year. The Green Terror opened the 2014 season with a stirring comeback win at Catholic, scoring 20 points in the final 6:35 to pull out a 34-31 win. Last week, McDaniel dropped its CC opener to Moravian, 28-7.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg has displayed the ability to produce big plays both on the ground and through the air and will try to take advantage of a McDaniel defense that allowed an average of more than 450 yards in its first two games. The Mule defense will be tested by a Green Terror passing attack that has thrown the ball 90 times for 511 yards in the first two weeks.</p>
<p>McDaniel leads the all-time series, 22-19-3.</p>

<p><strong>Cross Country at Dickinson Long/Short Invitational</strong></p>
<p>Dickinson is hosting its annual two-for-one meet, which features a 4K race for both men and women in addition to the standard distances. The meet will give the Mule teams a chance to run on the course that will be used for the NCAA Mideast Regional come November.</p>
<p><strong>Women&#8217;s Tennis at ITA Southeast Regional (Mary Washington); Women&#8217;s Golf at McDaniel Fall Invitational (Saturday)</strong></p>
<p>Both teams are traveling south, tennis to compete in the regional championships and golf to open its season.</p>

			<p>One of the big plays in yesterday&#8217;s Homecoming football win against Franklin &amp; Marshall was an 83-yard touchdown run by freshman Max Cepeda. But that wasn&#8217;t the only significant thing about the number 83.</p>
<div id="attachment_2366" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/09/palladino_nick.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2366" class="size-full wp-image-2366" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/09/palladino_nick.jpg" alt="Nick Palladino Class of 2017 Quarterback Allentown (N.J.)

High School</p></div>
<p>The 42-7 victory improved the Mules&#8217; all-time record to 497-497-41. It&#8217;s the first time they&#8217;ve been at .500 since 1931 &#8211; 83 years ago.</p>
<p>The Mules defeated St. Joseph’s, 7-0, in the fourth game of the 1931 campaign to put their all-time record at 115-114-22. They lost their next game to Ursinus to fall back to .500 and dropped the following contest to Lehigh to slip under .500.</p>
<p>And that is where they stayed for the next 83 years &#8211; until yesterday. Muhlenberg’s low-water mark came midway through the 1998 season, when a 34-31 loss at Johns Hopkins dropped its all-time record to 61 games under .500.</p>
<p>The Mules have made up that ground in fast order, going 114-53 (.683) over their last 167 games to get back to .500.</p>
<p>So where do they go from here? They can move above .500 with a win at McDaniel this Saturday. All-time win number 500 is on the horizon. The school record for games over .500 (10, when the 1927 season ended with an all-time record of 104-94-21) is within reach in the near future if the teams goes at its current pace.</p>
<div id="attachment_2365" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/09/palladino_ferdinand.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2365" class="size-full wp-image-2365" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/09/palladino_ferdinand.jpg" alt="Ferdinand Palladino Class of 1932 Quarterback Allentown (Pa.)

High School</p></div>
<p>The current Muhlenberg squad certainly does not want to go the way of the 1931 team, which represented the start of a downward slide for the program. That team finished with a record of 2-8 and scored only 51 points all season &#8211; a total the 2014 Mules needed only six quarters to surpass.</p>
<p>But the teams are linked, not only by their all-time record at one point during the season, but also by an incredible coincidence that stands as further proof that truth can be stranger than fiction: One of the members of the 1931 Muhlenberg football team was a quarterback from Allentown High School named Palladino.</p>

Plus, volleyball competes in a tournament for the third straight weekend and men&#8217;s tennis opens its year with a home tournament.</em></p>
<p><strong>Field Hockey vs. Drew (Friday, 7:00)</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg (2-1) plays its fourth straight home game to start the season against a Drew team that was 16-4 last year but is winless in four games so far this fall.</p>
<p>Defense has been the key for both teams: The Mules have allowed only two goals, the only one in the last 204 minutes coming on a penalty stroke. The Rangers, on the other hand, have allowed 18 goals in four games, the most coming in a 7-1 loss to Montclair State, which was undoubtedly eager to take out its anger on someone after losing to Muhlenberg.</p>
<p>Drew holds a 15-13-1 series lead, including a 6-1 win last year, but the home team has won the last five meetings.</p>

<p><strong style="color: #373737;">Volleyball at Knights Invitational: vs. Eastern (Friday, 6:00); vs. Neumann (Friday, 8:00); vs. Moravian (Saturday, 1:00); vs. Widener (Saturday, 3:00)</strong></p>
<p>After going 7-1 at Gettysburg and in its own tournament the last two weekends, Muhlenberg travels to Neumann for another tournament. The Mules&#8217; first opponent, Eastern, reached the NCAA semifinals in 2011 and the quarterfinals last year and is currently ranked 12th in Division III.</p>
<p>Host Neumann is 4-0, Moravian is 5-5, and Widener is 1-6.</p>
<p><strong>Cross Country Co-Hosts Cedar Crest/Muhlenberg Invitational (Saturday, 10:00)</strong></p>
<p>The Mules, running a short distance from campus, will aim for a repeat of last year, when they swept both the team and individual titles. Senior Luke Munyan is the defending men&#8217;s champion.</p>
<p><strong>Football vs. Franklin &amp; Marshall (Saturday, 1:00)</strong></p>
<p>The Centennial Conference opener for both teams could turn out to be one of the key games of the year. Muhlenberg and F&amp;M, both of which opened the season with wins last week, have received ECAC bowl bids each of the last two years and have their sights set on unseating five-time defending champion Johns Hopkins.</p>
<p>In the CC preseason poll, Muhlenberg was picked second (with six first-place votes) and Franklin &amp; Marshall was tabbed fourth.</p>
<p>Franklin &amp; Marshall leads the all-time series, 53-43-1. Since 2005, the teams have traded two-game series winning streaks, with Muhlenberg winning in 2007-08 and 2011-12 and the Diplomats prevailing in 2005-06 and 2009-10. F&amp;M won last year, 28-21.</p>
<p>The Mules come into the game with an all-time record of 496-497-41. With a win, they will climb to .500 for the first time since 1931.</p>

<p>The live video will feature highlights from the Mules&#8217; win vs. Wilkes at halftime.</p>
<p><strong>Men&#8217;s Soccer vs. Stevens (Saturday, 7:00)</strong></p>
<p>The biggest win for the Muhlenberg men’s soccer team in recent years came at the expense of Stevens. In the second round of the 2010 NCAA Tournament, the Mules won 2-1 in double-overtime, handing the Ducks their first NCAA loss (other than by shootout) since 2005 and snapping their 34-game home unbeaten streak.</p>
<p>None of the players from that game and only one of the head coaches will take part in this year&#8217;s Homecoming rematch (only the second regular-season meeting between the two teams since 1973), but the memory will linger on in both programs for years to come.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg is 3-0 for the first time since 2011 and receiving votes in the national Division III poll. Stevens, which has won at least 15 games for the last 12 years, is off to an uncharacteristic 2-2 start after losing only one regular-season game all of last season.</p>

<p><strong>Volleyball hosts Buttermaker Tournament: vs. FDU-Florham (Friday, 3:00); vs. Rutgers-Camden (Friday, 7:00); opponents TBD (Saturday, 10:00 and 2:00)</strong></p>
<p>The 17th Buttermaker Tournament features visiting teams from as close as Bethlehem (Moravian) and as far away as Winchester, Va. (Shenandoah). Allegheny, Baruch, DeSales and Elizabethtown round out the nine-team field.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg (3-1), coming off a strong showing at Gettysburg last weekend, is seeking its first Buttermaker title since 2005. Each of the last two years, the Mules went 2-0 on the first day of the tournament but 0-2 on the second</p>

<p><strong style="color: #373737;">Women’s Soccer vs. Delaware Valley (Friday, 7:00) and vs. Gwynedd Mercy (Saturday, 6:00)</strong></p>
<p>The regionally ranked Mules (2-0) play home games on back-to-back days for the second straight weekend. Last weekend, they defeated Wilkes and Marywood to open a season with two shutout wins for the first time since 1999.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg has never started with more than two shutout wins; in 1991, their first varsity season, the Mules blanked their first four opponents, but one of the games was a scoreless draw.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg scored 2-0 wins against both Delaware Valley (1-1) and Gwynedd Mercy (1-2) last year.</p>

<p><strong>Field Hockey vs. Elizabethtown (Saturday, 1:00)</strong></p>
<p>Fresh off its win against third-ranked Montclair State, Muhlenberg hosts another team that has not shied away from tough competition: Elizabethtown opened the season with one-goal losses to No. 8 Franklin &amp; Marshall and No. 12 Messiah.</p>
<p>Elizabethtown (14-6 last year) is part of an opening four-game stretch for the Mules against teams that combined for a .783 winning percentage in 2013.</p>
<p>The Blue Jays hold a 9-6-2 series lead and have won the last three meetings, scoring two goals in a span of less than three minutes to turn a 1-0 second-half deficit into a 2-1 victory last year.</p>

<p><strong>Football at Wilkes (Saturday, 1:00)</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg opens its 113th season of football with an interesting matchup against Wilkes. Although the teams haven&#8217;t played each other since 2009, there will be plenty of familiarity: The Colonels&#8217; new head coach is Trey Brown, the quarterbacks coach and special teams coordinator for the Mules for the last four years.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg returns most of its starting lineup from a 2013 squad that went 8-3 and earned an ECAC bowl bid. The Mules, ranked in the top 20 by Lindy&#8217;s and Sporting News, were picked second in the Centennial Conference preseason poll.</p>
<p>Wilkes, 4-6 last year, was eighth in the Middle Atlantic Conference preseason poll.</p>

<p><strong>Men&#8217;s Soccer at Marywood (Saturday, 4:00)</strong></p>
<p>The regionally ranked Mules (2-0) hit the road for the first time this year in a rematch of last year&#8217;s ECAC Tournament first-round game, which Muhlenberg won, 2-0.</p>
<p>Wilkes was the last opponent for both teams. Muhlenberg won, 4-0, and Marywood (0-1-1) lost, 4-1.</p>

<p><strong>Basketball at Washington College (Saturday, women at 2:00; men at 4:00)</strong></p>
<p>Both Muhlenberg teams are off to a hot start, with three wins and a Scotty Wood Tournament title under their belts. Although this is the third time in the last four years that both Mule squads started 3-0, it&#8217;s never happened that both started 4-0.</p>
<p>It also had never happened that both teams won a one-point game this early in the season, but the men edged Gwynedd Mercy, 81-80, in the Scotty Wood final, and the women outlasted Swarthmore, 75-74, in their overtime Centennial Conference opener.</p>
<p>This is the 21st time in the last 21 years that the Muhlenberg teams aren&#8217;t quite sure what to expect from their trip to Chestertown. Traditionally one of the hardest places in the CC for the Mules to play, the men won there last year but are only 5-16 at Washington since the start of CC play. The women have fared better, going 16-4, but it hasn&#8217;t been easy; two years ago, they <a href="http://www.muhlenberg.edu/main/athletics/winter12/0121.html">overcame a 17-point deficit</a> to win by three.</p>
<p>Both Washington teams are 0-2.</p>

			<p><em>Basketball shots &#8211; five from long range and one from very close range &#8211; from the Scotty Wood Tournament take this week&#8217;s honors.</em></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/stenger_three.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2110" alt="Abby Stenger" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/stenger_three.jpg" width="230" height="519" /></a>Female Play of the Week &#8211; Abby Stenger&#8217;s run of threes</strong></p>
<p>The Mule women&#8217;s basketball team had a 12-point lead cut to three earlier in the half, so when it went up 51-41 with 11 minutes left in the Scotty Wood championship game, there was still a chance that Misericordia would come back again. Stenger made sure that didn&#8217;t happen, drilling five straight three-pointers in a five-minute span. By the time her run was done, the Mules led by 23 (70-47) and were well on their way to the championship.</p>
<p>To say that the spurt came out of nowhere would be an understatement: Stenger missed her first seven shots from three-point range in the tournament, and the Mules and Cougars were a combined 0-for-9 from behind the arc before Stenger went off.</p>

<p><strong>Male Play of the Week &#8211; Malique Killing pass for Kevin Hargrove dunk</strong></p>
<p>Killing distinguished himself with his scoring during the Scotty Wood Tournament, netting 28 points &#8211; including the 1,000th of his career &#8211; in the championship game to earn MVP honors. But in the first-round game against Bryn Athyn, it was a pass he made that brought the loudest cheers.</p>
<p>With the Mules already leading 69-44, Killing rebounded a missed Lion three-pointer, dribbled the length of the court, spun in the lane and fed an open Hargrove for a dunk.</p>

			<p><em>Not much going on in Muhlenberg athletics this weekend &#8211; except for an eight-team basketball tournament, a rivalry football game, an NCAA cross country meet, a postseason soccer tournament and four wrestling matches. It&#8217;s one of the biggest weekends of the year!</em></p>

The Mule women open up against Rowan on Friday at 6:00, followed by the men against Bryn Athyn. Both Muhlenberg teams are trying to recapture the titles they won in 2011 after falling in the championship games last year.</p>

<p><strong>Cross Country hosts NCAA Mideast Regional (Saturday, women at 11:00, men at 12:30)</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/ncaaxcsquare.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2092" alt="NCAA cross country" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/ncaaxcsquare.jpg" width="203" height="211" /></a>Nearly 1,000 runners from 60 schools are scheduled to line up on Lehigh&#8217;s Goodman Campus in one of eight qualifier meets for the NCAA Championships (slated for next Saturday at Hanover, Ind.). Haverford has won the men&#8217;s meet the last three years, while Johns Hopkins brings in a streak of five straight regional championships.</p>
<p>The top two teams in each race automatically qualify for the NCAA Championships, and there are also 16 at-large berths available to fill out the 32-team national field. After the team bids have been determined, the top seven individuals in each region not on a qualifying team are selected to run in the national meet.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg, which is hosting the regional meet for the fourth time since 2001, has sent at least one runner to the NCAA Championships for the last eight seasons. Senior Nicki Cronin, who earned all-region honors by placing in the top 35 in both 2011 and 2012 and narrowly missed an NCAA berth last year, is the top candidate to continue that streak.</p>

<p>The Mules (7-2, 6-2) come in on a historic roll, having beaten five straight opponents by at least 20 points for the first time in program history. The Greyhounds (2-7, 2-6) are on a surge of their own, with two wins in their last three games following on 0-6 start.</p>
<p>Moravian has topped the 40-point mark three times in its last five games and boasts the top freshman runner and top rushing quarterback in the Centennial Conference. Muhlenberg has allowed only one offensive touchdown at home this season and ranks in the top 30 in Division III in scoring defense (20th), pass efficiency defense (24th), total defense (26th) and rushing defense (28th). The Mules have given up only three offensive touchdowns in their five-game winning streak.</p>
<p>Two Mule milestones are possible: Nick Palladino needs 141 yards to break the CC mark for passing yards by a freshman, and Cody Geyer needs 88 receiving yards to record the fourth 1,000-yard season in program history.</p>
<p>Moravian leads the all-time series, 33-26-2, but Muhlenberg has won eight of the last 11 meetings. The Mules have not allowed an offensive touchdown in taking the last two meetings.</p>

<p><strong>Men&#8217;s Soccer at Swarthmore (Saturday, 7:00)</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/ecacclr.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2091" alt="ECAC logo" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/ecacclr-300x93.jpg" width="300" height="93" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/ecacclr-300x93.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/ecacclr.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>The Mules (10-7-1) look to extend their season with an ECAC South semifinal game against CC rival Swarthmore (10-5-4). The winner faces the winners of the other semi between Frostburg State and Lebanon Valley in Sunday&#8217;s championship match.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg hasn&#8217;t beaten Swarthmore since 2007, but all the meetings since have been close: a scoreless tie, two 1-0 games and four 2-1 games. The last time the teams faced each other in the postseason was the 2010 CC championship game, a thriller that the Garnet won in double overtime.</p>
<p>The Mules went on to advance to the NCAA &#8220;Sweet 16&#8221; that year, which was the last time they won two postseason games in a season. Muhlenberg reached the ECAC championship game in both 1999 and 2000; its last ECAC title came in 1988.</p>

<p><strong>Wrestling at Penn Tech with Lafayette (Saturday, 12:00); at Scranton with Yeshiva (Sunday, 11:00)</strong></p>
<p>After winning a dual meet at Mount St. Vincent last weekend, the Mules will try to pick up some more wins. Muhlenberg outscored Scranton in contested bouts, 25-3, the last two years, but lost the matches due to forfeits. The Mules defeated Yeshiva, 24-15, when the teams last met in 2011.</p>

			<p><em>It&#8217;s Wong and Long for our plays of the week.</em></p>
<p><strong>Female Play of the Week &#8211; Amanda Wong, Soccer</strong></p>
<p>This was an easy pick &#8211; Muhlenberg led McDaniel, 4-3, in a shootout in the first round of the Centennial Conference playoffs when Wong lined up to face a penalty kick from Kristin Hart. Wong dove to her right as the ball was struck and saved the shot, giving the Mules the win and sending them to the CC semifinals.</p>
<p>It was the first time in Muhlenberg soccer history that a postseason shootout ended with a Mule goalie saving a PK. Wong was phenomenal throughout the game, tying a career high with 12 saves in the scoreless tie.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Male Play of the Week &#8211; Michael Long, Football</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg has been at its exciting and explosive best during its current five-game winning streak with long passes to receivers (well, one receiver in particular) streaking down the field.</p>
<p>Its longest play came on a pass that traveled about 4 yards beyond the line of scrimmage.</p>
<p>The Mules led Ursinus, 20-3, at the start of the fourth quarter, but after a sluggish third quarter in which they&#8217;d gained a grand total of 3 yards on their last 10 plays, they needed a big play to shake things up and turn the field around.</p>
<p>Facing 2nd and 11 from its own 17 on the first play of the final period, Muhlenberg got the big play from Long. It didn&#8217;t look like much when Nick Palladino threw a quick pass to Long at the 21, but the big tight end broke a tackle, got some good downfield blocking from Chris Litzenberger and knocked down two would-be tacklers with stiff arms before finally getting dragged down at the Ursinus 17.</p>
<p>The 66-yard play was the Mules&#8217; longest from scrimmage this season.</p>

<p>Three plays later, Muhlenberg was in the end zone to make it 27-3, and less than three minutes, an interception and a long touchdown pass after that, it was 34-3.</p>
<p>Although Long gets the top honor for the second time this season, it really wouldn&#8217;t be the play of the week without some Cody Geyer footage. Below is video of his three touchdown receptions in the 41-10 win.</p>

<p><strong>Women&#8217;s Soccer at Johns Hopkins (Friday, 5:00)</strong></p>
<p>Coming off their thrilling shootout win against McDaniel in the first round of the Centennial Conference playoffs, the Mules (7-10-2) will need another tremendous team effort against Johns Hopkins in the semifinals. The Blue Jays (16-1-1) are ranked fifth in Division III, have won seven of the last eight CC championships and are 8-0 at home this season. They won the regular-season meeting against Muhlenberg, 5-0.</p>
<p>This will be the fifth postseason meeting between the two teams, with Johns Hopkins holding a 2-1-1 advantage. The Mules beat Blue Jay teams ranked in the top 10 in three of the last five years.</p>

<p><strong>Volleyball vs. McDaniel at Franklin &amp; Marshall (Saturday, 3:30)</strong></p>
<p>Two teams that tied for last place in the CC three years ago meet in a semifinal match, with the winner headed to Sunday&#8217;s championship match. It&#8217;s the second postseason meeting between the two schools; the first came in the 1992 MAC playoffs.</p>

<p><strong>Football at Ursinus (Saturday, 1:00)</strong></p>
<p>These two teams are tied for second place in the Centennial Conference and have identical records of 6-2 overall and 5-2 in the league. Muhlenberg comes in on a roll, having won its last four games, all by at least 20 points. Ursinus was 5-0 before the bye week and has been hard to figure out since returning: The Bears lost 28-7 at home to Juniata and nearly won at Johns Hopkins.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg has won 12 of the last 13 meetings to extend its series lead to 45-24-7. The last two meetings came down to the last play, with the Mules blocking a field goal at the final horn for a 24-21 win two years ago and batting away a pass in overtime last season to preserve a 24-17 victory.</p>
