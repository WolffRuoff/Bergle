								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Even with the dangerous persuasion of social networking sites, along with the anonymity and individualistic power there is online today, the vast majority of our worlds digital users still shy away from understanding what really is hidden within “The Cloud”. In my article entitled, “Influence of Social Media on Teenagers” written by Suren Ramasubbu, many of the realistic threats of the internet are looked at in comparison with the benefits new technologies have to offer. We all know that social media can broaden social connections throughout the world and may seem harmless as advertised thousands of times per day but what isn’t shown are the life altering repercussions in both professional and personal areas of life.</p>
<p>The real problem is right in front of us. Facebook depression, Internet addiction, cyber bullying, sleep deprivation, obesity and sexting are just a few of the things that should call for the attention and be recognized as a major problem in our world today. Ramasubbu affirmatively states, “The lack or difficulty in self-regulation and susceptibility to peer pressure makes adolescents vulnerable to such evils as <a href="http://guilfordjournals.com/doi/abs/10.1521/jscp.2014.33.8.701">Facebook depression</a>, sexting, and cyberbullying, which are realistic threats” (Ramasubbu, 2015, p.1.). Our youth’s vulnerability can lead to much more than just an occasional blog post or tweet. The consequences of cyberbullying can be life altering. Ramasubbu made a very interesting point in that the two kinds of people who are likely to be cyberbullies are the popular ones and those on the fringes of society. Many technologies today have the power to disconnect children from reality. It is those people who then feel invincible hiding their insecurities behind their 20 inch laptop computer screen to go out and hurt somebody else’s life. It becomes very ironic how the individualistic nature of social networking can make it difficult to recognize a victim of cyberbullying. Not only does social networking give adolescents the power to bully behind a computer screen but it hides those being bullied as well. Ramasubbu closes his argument by saying, “Adolescence is the time for teens to spread their wings and take the tentative first flight out into the world…” (Ramasubbu, 2015, p.1.). He encourages teens to make a productive leap into the world, and not the digital world. He advocates that teens must learn to understand what the internet has to offer and how these things can both positively and negatively impact society.</p>
