								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The amount of people that are gaining access to the internet and smart technology is increasing every day. According to a recent study conducted in seven different European countries (Belgium, Denmark, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Romania and the United Kingdom), many more children aged 9-16 are obtaining these technologies (Mascheroni &amp; Ólafsson, 2016). There has been less attention to this issue than issues such as inequalities in technology (Mascheroni &amp; Ólafsson, 2016).  According to another study “People who have more Internet access points are more likely to possess higher levels of online skill and have more opportunities to explore a wide range of mobile phone features” (Mascheroni &amp; Ólafsson, 2016). The usage patterns suggest that those better connected had a better chance to climb the ladder of opportunities which would make them better candidates for jobs (Mascheroni &amp; Ólafsson, 2016). When the data for each country was compared to the others, the variations were linked to the different levels of adoption and use of smartphones in each country (Mascheroni &amp; Ólafsson, 2016). This was tested to show that the increase in children with smartphones directly impacted the ability to get jobs. They compared gender, age, smartphone ownership and daily use, child’s experience with the internet and parental ownership and use of a mobile device so that all variables were accounted for (Mascheroni &amp; Ólafsson, 2016). The results indicated that kids were more likely to own a cellphone in certain countries and those who do had a higher likelihood of using it for the internet (Mascheroni &amp; Ólafsson, 2016). Another result found was that those of higher socioeconomic status were “69% less likely to use social media” (Mascheroni &amp; Ólafsson, 2016). This is odd because in America, it’s usually the opposite with wealthy people using more social media than those with less wealth.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In my senior year of high school, everything went digital. Every student was given an iPad that came with many educational apps. The most essential one was called eBackpack, which contains all of the worksheets and activities for each class. Every assignment was to be submitted digitally, and even some of my quizzes were digital. My grades peaked senior year, and to this day I still wonder if it is because of the iPads. Prior to senior year, I always had trouble keeping track of all of my papers. Not only was it a drag to carry a 6-pocket folder that was completely stuffed with papers, but <strong>on top of that</strong> I had to carry my notebooks and heavy textbooks. Once I got my iPad, the after school backaches went away by this environmentally friendly substitute.</p>
<p><em>Aside from saving trees, why else are technological advancements positive for educational systems? </em>Well according to Tiffani Pittman and Trudi Gaines, &#8220;technology can be an important tool used to enhance and expand the learner’s opportunities to interact with the environment by providing access to a virtual environment previously unavailable in real life and real time&#8221; (Pittman and Gaines 540). In their research study, Pittman and Gaines conducted a survey for 3rd, 4th, and 5th grade teachers in a Florida school district and concluded that there is a positive correlation between high-level technology use and &#8220;teachers’ attitudes and beliefs about the importance of technology integration and direct student access to computers within the classroom&#8221; (Pittman and Gaines 550). This conclusion is significant because it is important for teachers to be enthusiastic about integrating technology in the classroom in order to get the children to be enthusiastic.</p>
<p>Though this research is reliable, it is limited in that it doesn&#8217;t cover the negatives of technology in classrooms. One of which I found to be big senior year was that technology can be very distracting. It was very easy to make it look like you were doing work on your iPad. But in reality, you were playing Candy Crush.</p>
