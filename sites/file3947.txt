Company bets we&#8217;ll listen to a &#8216;celestial jukebox&#8217;. <em>IndyStar Business and Technology</em> Retrieved From <a href="http://www.indystar.com/article/20110403/BUSINESS06/304030004/1281/BUSINESS06">http://www.indystar.com/article/20110403/BUSINESS06/304030004/1281/BUSINESS06<br />

<p>Are we beginning to count on the Internet for everything?  Not only are we beginning to rely on our music playlists created on online streaming cloud-based sites, but the founders of Skype are betting on our usual creation of playlists created in iTunes, are moving to &#8216;<a href="http://www.indystar.com/article/20110403/BUSINESS06/304030004/1281/BUSINESS06">celestial jukeboxes</a>&#8216; listened to through the Internet.  These internet radio stations, and cloud-based playlist options, are becoming new distributors for artists&#8217; music.  We aren&#8217;t completely forgetting about terrestrial radio in cars, and on systems in the house, but when people are choosing to listen to these internet streams they immediately think, well&#8230; can I play this in my car? Around the house?  In the bathroom?  And with the emergence of new technologies that support the access of these internet &#8220;user-created&#8221; stations and playlists, industries of many different types want to get their feet in the door.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span id="more-1043"></span></p>
<p>Linking with the music industry, radio is now becoming an on-demand service.  Listeners are able to pick their music, and if they have the technologies acquired for listening to their music, they will be more than willing to do so.  The automobile industry, smartphone industry, and the television industry are all becoming exhibitors and distributors for this idea of the &#8221; &#8216;celestial jukebox&#8217; of the Internet, allowing listeners to play virtually any song, any time, anywhere, through a variety of Internet-linked devices.&#8221;  Not only do we see the Internet becoming a huge producer and distributor for the internet radio, its facilitation is allowing for extreme variety when it comes to listening to music.</p>
<p>This is extremely threatening to FM/AM radio.  Those who will have access to these streaming sites will begin to acknowledge the fact that they are willing to pay a subscription fee/month to be able to listen to any music of their choice.  Instead of turning on the radio, hearing the same 20 songs played by the hour, and listening to boring, ever-lasting advertisements, they can subscribe to the internet radio sites, create their own playlists, and enjoy the music that they want to hear.  Some of these cloud-based sites aren&#8217;t subscription based yet, so they still need the support of the advertising power role, but in time they will build up to being subscription based.</p>
<p>&#8220;<a href="http://mog.com/">Mog</a> and <a href="http://www.rdio.com/">Rdio</a> offer subscribers unlimited access for a set monthly fee &#8212; $9.99 for both companies. For that amount, subscribers can select any song from a catalog of 8 million to 10 million tunes and listen through any device connected to the Internet.&#8221;  These are other Internet radio sites like Pandora and Slacker radio, and are giving people the chance of unlimited access for a small fee.  These sites can be accessed in the car, on a smartphone, and even on the television. &#8221; For times they lack an Internet connection, subscribers can store songs to a phone or laptop, music they can use as long as they subscribe.&#8221;  This is an extremely important feature because I&#8217;m sure the client-based roles were concerned with this aspect.  Not only could this bump out iTunes as a music distributor and exhibitor, but it can also knock out mp3&#8217;s and CD&#8217;s.  All in all, the internet is beginning to control not only social life, but how we now listen to music, and understand radio.  We don&#8217;t envision radio as talkshows, or advertisements anymore, because we have the ability to create the music played for us on &#8220;our&#8221; own, creator made radio stations.</p>
