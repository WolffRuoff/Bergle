<p>Are you ready? Sitting down?</p>
<p>I am sorry to announce that this will be my last blog post of the year. Yes I know, so sad! Unfortunately the time has come to say goodbye. Junior year has come to an end and now it’s time to start thinking about the summer festivities.</p>
<p>I am thrilled to announce that this summer I will be conducting Neuroscience research with a professor at Muhlenberg. Additionally, I was awarded the position of <em>Presidential Assistant for Religious Life</em> at Muhlenberg, where I will be responsible for programing and engagement for Hillel (the Jewish organization on campus). I am so excited to begin this position in June of this summer and continue through the end of the academic year (2016).</p>
<p>Thank you all for letting me share my experiences at Muhlenberg and abroad with all of you. To all of those prospective students out there, come find me next year! I would love to meet all of you and introduce you to my home away from home, Muhlenberg.</p>
<p>Always,</p>
<p>Ariel</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every weekend abroad has become a different adventure: new cities, interesting countries, and even secluded kibbutzim around Israel. My experience so far has been a collage of new people, new experiences, and new ideas. I finally feel like I am home here. The friends that I have made along with these adventures have shaped my time abroad into such a special experience.</p>
<p>Yesterday, my sorority was having their “Senior pass down”, a ceremony where the Seniors “pass down” their letters (the sorority shirts) to the Juniors and Sophomores. I Skyped into this ceremony because it is a very important day for our Seniors. Although I feel so at home right now in Israel, I couldn’t help but think about how much I am missing at Muhlenberg this semester. Even though I know leaving Israel will be incredibly difficult, I am comforted by the fact that I will be coming back to my other home-away-from-home, Muhlenberg.</p>
<p>&#8216;Till next time,</p>
<p>Ariel</p>
