								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Patel, K. (April 4, 2011). Networks, Exchanges Are Not Immune to Groupon-Cloning Fad. <em>Advertising Age.</em> Retrieved from <a href="http://adage.com/article/special-report-audience-buying-guide/networks-exchanges-immune-groupon-cloning-fad/149656/">http://adage.com/article/special-report-audience-buying-guide/networks-exchanges-immune-groupon-cloning-fad/149656/</a></p>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://www.welovedc.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/groupon.png" alt="" width="400" height="155" /> Groupon uses the power of the traditional “group discount,” and economies of scale, to save individuals money. When a certain number of people opt-in, they all benefit from the discount. One may consider Groupon the improved digital incarnate of coupon circulars, socialized to create better deals. This has attracted the attention of the newspaper industry, as newspaper titans such as Hearst and New York Times have contracted with smaller distributors in the emerging “deals market,” or exchanges, such Analog Analytics. For example:</p>
<div><span id="more-1050"></span></div>
<div>
<blockquote><p>On Analog, a publisher like the Register, which sells the deal, gets 15% of all deals sold on any site; the publisher that distributes the deal &#8212; LA News, in this case &#8212; gets 20% and Analog gets 15% for brokering. (The merchant, per the usual Groupon model, gets the 	remaining 50%.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Deals networks such as ReachLocal and Tippr easily entered the deals market, breaking the traditional high barriers to entry that existed with printed circular coupons. While Groupon and LivingSocial are dominate players in the deals market, power is less concentrated because of the ease at which new locally focused exhibitors can enter the market. For example, Facebook is working with ReachLocal to target audiences in San Deigo, while using Tippr, Gilt City, OpenTable and PopSugar City to target markets in other cities.</p>
<p>The power roles frame classifies these Internet group coupon companies as an exhibitors and producers. Smaller companies occupy the exhibitor role, choosing to give up a certain percent of profit to brokers such as Analog Analytics (who produce the deals).  This allows for smaller exhibitors to compete with the major players in the industry. Without the help of deals suppliers such as Adility, who have built up relationships with local merchants over the years with printed coupons, these larger companies would have near complete control the industry.</p>
