					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Sites like Groupon are really fascinating in the Internet industry, because much of their content relies on the crowdsourced content provided by online users (the paragon of this is, of course, YouTube).  In this sense, the websites act simply as distributors of user-generated content (placing the user in the role of creator!  Though, of course, without the power that creators typically have).  The exhibitors would be the ISPs that provide user access to the Internet - So, in this case, it would be companies like Comcast, etc that sell access to the Internet for a monthly fee.  Hope this clears up some of the power roles confusion!&lt;/p&gt;
