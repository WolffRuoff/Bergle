					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Great one again, Group 4 - The syndication market can be a very profitably distribution strategy for reruns of major network programs.  Indeed, if you look back to the 90s and the attempt by Time-Warner to start their own television network (the WB, if anyone remembers!), their feature selling point was rerun of the hit TV show &quot;Friends&quot; which they owned because they were the producer of the program (NBC was simply the distributor).  The Friends example shows the limits of this strategy, though - while the ratings for the Friends reruns were strong on The WB, the other shows they programmed did not as a rule catch fire with viewers.  Perhaps Glee&#039;s cross-promotion and linking pins will make it a better bet for future profitability.  Good article and analysis here.&lt;/p&gt;
