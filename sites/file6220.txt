								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>**I wrote this post last week and I just found it in my drafts when I was writing my final paper!</p>
<p>I was not in ELL this week because I had a dance performance. However, I did have my last week of fieldwork and I must say that I learned the most in that week then in any other. Â We had a shortened class because of a field trip so me and my fieldwork teacher ventured up to the 3rd floor where some of our students were in math class and we were there for extra support. Something that stood out to me is how well some of them did in this class. Yes, they struggle with reading however they make up for it in math. I think that this is because math is numbers, not letters. As long as the instructions are clearly mapped out for them they exceed in it. These children are not stupid (not that I ever thought they were) they are just English Language Learners with an uneven disadvantage.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ELL: This week, in ELL, my micro teach group gave our presentation to the class. Although we were prepared, there were still parts of it that surprised me. Something that stood out were the various ways that we approached the same thing. For example, when somebody asked Anna a question her response was a bit more direct and to the point. She was a lot more strict and and stern with &#8220;the children&#8221;. However, Brooke, on the other hand went slower and answered questions in a different manner. This made me realize that team-teaching, even though there is many good aspects, can be difficult and confusing, especially for the children.</p>
<p>GEOGRAPHY: During our final wrap-up, something that stood out to me was how our conversation started as geographical locations and quickly shifted to societies, cultures, religions and even our own school. It amazed me how something that I used to think of as so one-dimetional can actually have so many moving parts. For example, at one point I brought up the fact that when I was in Israel who the culture there is my religion here and how where we are on a map, physically, can affect our relationships with not only others, but ourselves as well.</p>
<p>FIELDWORK CONNECTION: There is a distinct difference in the way I answer question an approach situations in my fieldwork classroom than in the way my cooperating fieldwork teacher does. Of course, it is her classroom and I am just the guest so I expect that I would not go in with the same manner that I would in my own classroom, especially when I do not always know the answer to the students questions. With that being said, this (along with all of my other fieldwork) is helping me in seeing not just what I want to do the same, but also what I want to do differently when I am a teacher. Not all teachers are the same.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ELL: A majority of class this week was focus of SIOP. Me and a few other people worked on revising a lesson that was given to us. What really stood out to me the most is that I am finally on the other side. Yes, I am a student at school. However, I am no longer just the student. I am also the teacher and soon I will be a teacher. SIOP is the first step to this realization that someday soon I will be planning and executing lessons of my own. After all, I already did that last week in my fieldwork classroom, with the assessment.</p>
<p>GEOGRAPHY: Something that I find kind of funny about the &#8220;quinoa fad&#8221; is that seven years ago, before everybody really knew about it, my mom had be eating quinoa like no tomorrow. She said it was super healthy and I never really thought too much about it. When it came to processed foods like cereals or snacks my mom would always mention how they came from plants where stuff is processed and chemicals are added. However, she never really mentioned (probably because she does not know) that healthy food, like quinoa can come from &#8220;bad&#8221; places too. Yes, it may not be processed however it is still not from a pure place that is not hurting people.</p>
<p>FIELDWORK: Last week I gave my assessment in fieldwork and the previous week I wrote my paper regarding comprehensible input. This week, in ELL, we spoke of of SIOP, and this is something that made all of the moving pieces that we have been doing come together in my mind. SIOP is the overarching idea/concept that surrounds, not only the teaching of English Language Learners, but all learners in general. Personally, I feel that Comprehensible Input and SIOP are paired together, as one and that the assessment that I gave and bits and pieces of each, without me even realizing.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ELL: This week we focused on SIOP. One part that stood out to me was when we watched the videos of the two teachers teaching in separate classrooms. Pretty quickly the class was rumbling about various things that each one did. Good and bad. For example, when the first teacher was pacing back and forth and reading a book without any pause we all knew that that was not a &#8220;good&#8221; or effective way of teaching. However, when it came to the other teacher, sitting in a circle with the children, it seemed as though there were many praises. For example, how she called each student by name. When I am a teacher, I hope that I can take all of the experience and what I have watched and apply it (whether that be not doing something or doing it).</p>
<p>GOEGRAPHY: The part that stuck out to me the most, about the film, was how quickly Vik Muniz was to change his opinion. Also, how contradictiveÂ he was to what he was saying. Before he left for Brazil he was showing his wife pictures of the site where he was going to head. He was saying how the pickers their work as drug dealers and are the lowest of the lows. However, he then goes on and says that he is making art of them to show how beautiful and big they can be, they are not just other scraps of garbage.</p>
<p>FIELDWORK and ELL: This week I got a chance to work one-on-one with a few children. There was one point where I was explaining directions to a girl and all of the sudden she said, &#8220;No speak English&#8221; -like something you would see out of a movie. I then had to try to remember the little Spanish that I did know and say a few words here and there. However, besides that Â there was not much else I could do. I tried to slow down and annunciate what I was saying. My ELL paper was on Comprehensible Input and one of the techniques of CI is slowing down and pronouncing the words that you re saying. I knew that she would not understand what she sis not know, but if I slowed down and pointed to words while seeing them she may be able to comprehend something.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[ELL: Comprehensible Input is something that all teachers, not just ESOL teachers do. I feel that comprehensible input does not just happen in the classroom, but in everyday life, as well.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ELL: Comprehensible Input is something that all teachers, not just ESOL teachers do. I feel that comprehensible input does not just happen in the classroom, but in everyday life, as well. For example, when I was a nanny, over the summer, I watched five girls..two of which were under age two and did not communicate using words. I would point to objects and say what the object was, such as &#8220;juice box&#8221;. I would then say the word &#8220;juice box&#8221; and they would repeat what I just said. Not only would I be saying the word but pointing to an object, thus making them comprehend what the object was.</p>
<p>GEOGRAPHY: Could something be a bad and aÂ good thing? Yes, I think that it can. Rarely, something is black and white&#8230;it is grey and that is the case with China and the current pollution problem. It is true that China is a major contributor to green house gasses, after all they are the largest coal consumers. With that being said, it seems as though they are taking big steps to reduce the emissions. So when somebody asks, &#8220;is China a problem or a solution?&#8221;, I think it is the problem and the solution.</p>
<p>FIELDWORK: One of the students in my fieldwork is from a refugee camp, in Africa. She does not speak English or Spanish, so there is no mode of communication. She does not even know the sounds of the English alphabet. With that being said, she was able to repeat a word when the teacher looked her in the eye and said a word. She was able to say it with ease. My question now is how does this child learn the English language? Should she learn the alphabet first or just repeat words? What is the best method?</p>
<p>ELL and FIELDWORK: When teaching a lesson, my cooperating teacher uses pictures and word banks to help make the lesson more <em>comprehensible</em>. However, when that does not work, she usually code-switches. For example, she would say, &#8220;everybody please eschutar&#8221;. However, there are a few students who do not speak English or Spanish. So what do you do then? The only way to communicate it through pictures and pointing&#8230;and it seems to be more memorization for them, rather than learning. Is there a way to make a lesson more comprehensible? I feel bad for these students. For me, it would Â be like moving to China and having somebody say something in Russian and Mandarin, I would not be able to understand either.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>FIELDWORK: This week was my first week of fieldwork, and it was hectic to say the least. For half of the time, I was in the wrong classroom (the security guard brought me there, and it was an ESOL class, and she was expecting a fieldwork student-so it took an hour and half to figure out that I was in the wrong place. Needless to say, even though I will never be in the first classroom, again, I still got a glimpse into two teaching styles for English Language Learners.</p>
<p>ELL: The process in which students are evaluated if they should go into an ESL classroom, or not, I found highly fascinating. I mainly thought this because it seems like there are many flaws in the system. First off, the form that the student&#8217;s families have to take home and fill out are in English (some many be in Spanish), but what if the family speaks another language, such as Mandarin or an African dialect? Also, Professor Emetic told us that sometimes you see multiple forms from the same family, but with different answers-sometimes it would say that English was there first language, and sometimes it would say that another language was there first langue. This opens up a whole new question&#8230;did the family not understand the question or were they trying to cheat the system?</p>
<p>GEOGRAPHY: Something that we discussed is, as a teacher, how do we redirect topics, especially uncomfortable ones? We were doing it unintentionally in our own debate, however if a kid comes into our class and asks about Israel, What do we say? Â Karl suggested saying, &#8220;we are not talking about the region at the moment&#8221;. However, what if you are talking about that region? What do you say then? DoÂ we say what is going on, do we fabricate the truth or do we lie? These are questions in which I am not sure can be completely answered,ever.</p>
<p>BOTH, ELL and FIELDWORK: In my fieldwork classroom (the one that I am actually suppose to be in) there are two rounds of children, 2nd grade and 4th grade. In the 2nd grade round there are three children, two native Spanish speakers and one, little girl, who just moved from Africa a few weeks ago. My cooperating teacher is a native English speaker and is fluent in Spanish, so when the children really do not understand her, in English she may throw in some Spanish phrases. However, the girl from Africa does not know Spanish or English, so it is ten times harder for her to understand a task. This is just like on the Home Language Survey. If the survey only comes in a Â few languages, how is a school suppose to judge a student&#8217;s abilities?</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ELL: The main question for our class, this week, is &#8220;how do we teach to children who are different than ourselves?&#8221;. During the class, I thought about my fieldwork last semester, and how I responded to my environment. It was in a kindergarten classroom at Muhlenberg Elementary and even though the children there were having much different kindergarten experience than I had, such as security guards right outside of school and uniforms, I strived to find the similarities. I feel that in order to teach kids who are different than you, it is helpful to first find what you have in common, such as a favorite color or book. Once, we can connect on that level, I feel that it is easier to connect on a much larger level.</p>
<p>GEOGRAPHY: None</p>
<p>BOTH: Since my first fieldwork is on Monday I am unable to connect that, however I have found similarities in my past week, here at school.</p>
<p>In my Dance and Society class our theme for the past two weeks have been focusing on African American dancers throughout American history, and many hardships are similar to what most face. I have never and will never be able to connect with African American&#8217;s by the color of our skin. Meaning, I will never know what it is like to be an African American dancer, however we still do have things in common. We are all people, and we all face hardships such as body discrimination or hard rehearsals.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ELL: One of the main highlights of class, this week, was the debate which took place. What I found interesting about it is that, I feel, that you go into some of the situations, in the classroom, and have your own personal opinion on the way things should be. However, in a debate when you are automatically given a side, it is not always the one that you agree with. Because of this, you have to switch your way of thinking. This can be annoying and difficult, however it can also help, in many ways. For example, you are now better able to, not necessarily understand, but see where the other side is coming from, and in turn, see the struggle with the real-life debate going on, outside the classroom and are able to get a little bit of insight of why the answer is not always black and white.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>GEOGRPAHY: This week I had to drop off a few checks at the Bank of America, down the street. However, I have never been to it before. When I looked it up on the map, I must admit that I was a bit nervous traveling to 14<sup>th</sup> street, by myself, to a bank. However, I then thought of geography class and I thought of âwhy is past 17<sup>th</sup> street considered âsketchyâ?â I then decided rather than being nervous to venture by myself to change it into a learning opportunity, to ask myself âwhy do I feel this way when I think of this area? âis it because others have told me? Have I actually experienced it for myself?â</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BOTH: Both things that I wrote about, this week connect in the sense that there is always another side to a story. In ELL, I feel that the connection is more prominent. We literally we debating two separate sides in class, it was a literal sense of two points of view regarding the same story. We saw, talked about and discussed both sides. However, my experience with geography, this week, was more along the lines of the idea of trying to understand the full story before judging it. Before I say, âthis place looks sketchyâ, I should try to think that there is another side to this story, just because a place looks the way it does, does not mean that the people are a direct representation. For example, people living in a run-down house, may actually want to upkeep it more (for example, fix the paint on the outside) however, the land lord will not let them.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ELL: Unfortunately, I was in the hospital, this week, so I was unable to attend class. However, I was able to do the readings and the video. One idea that stood out to me in the Patricia Kuhl, TED Talk was the period of time that is the &#8220;critical period&#8221;, which is age 8-10 months. Yes, I understand how babies are &#8220;taking statistics&#8221;. However, I am still left with a lot of questions. For example, I had a roommate at a summer program who was from Switzerland. She grew up speaking German and French, but learned English, in fourth grade and was fluent in it. She said she usually dreamt in German but when I heard her speak in her sleep, she spoke French. What is happening in people&#8217;s brain in order to switch languages on an off?</p>
<p>GEOGRAPHY: Â Our readings and theme this week surrounded the American Indians. When I was writing a post for class, something popped up in my brain. Yes, I did have the privilege to learn a great deal about both sides of the &#8216;original&#8217; settlers (Pilgrims and Indians) when I was younger. When I lived in Boston, we would go to Plymouth Plantation all of the time. I learned about how each side lived-their cultural believes and how there was a lot of dispute. But despite all of this, I never really learned, or at least I do not remember learning what finally got the original settlers and Native Americans to make peace and have the First Thanksgiving. I know we read more about modern times, but this is something that started to bug me.</p>
<p>BOTH: There are many stereotypes about the American Indians, in today&#8217;s world-I mean there are stereotypes for almost every, if not every, race, culture, religion, etc.. However, where do these stereotypes come from? Are they taught to us when we are young? If we experience something that gives us a glimpse into what other cultures are like why are people not totally rid of their previous thoughts, all of the time? Is it because we, as humans, have this sort of &#8216;common underlying proficiency&#8217;. Yes, I know that that is a language term that was used in an ELL article this week, but I feel that it can be used for other things, as well. Even when stepping into a community I feel that it almost impossible to try and totally rid your stereotypes of the type of people who are there-you drawn knowledge from what you already know, just like you draw knowledge from what you already know when learning a language.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ELL: The topic in which I found the most interesting, in class this week,Â is when we started to talk about back channeling, pauses, etc.. These are things that we do in our everyday life, every minute we talk, and we do not think about it, at all, and people cannot have normative English-speaking conversation without these cultural markers. Something that resonated deeply with me is that, growing up, we do not only learn the physical parts of a language but also the cultural tendencies that go with the language, as well. Such as saying &#8220;um&#8221; for a pause or &#8220;mhm&#8221; and nodding our head, when we understand something. If somebody from China came to America and was not use to these &#8220;customs&#8221; which we take for granted, they could be seen as rude, strange or unintelligent, however it can be an easy fix.</p>
<p>GEOGRAPHY: Our main focus, this week was Africa. We had to complete a map quiz, as well as some readings regarding the lack of knowledge that some may have of the &#8220;true&#8221; Africa. At one point, we were asked how much schooling have you had regarding Africa. At first, I thought I had a lot..I mean in high school I took World history and geography and did Model UN. However, I realized that it was not until high school that I actually learned about Africa. I cannot remember a specific time in elementary or middle school where the continent was a main focus point. I think that the closes that I ever got to learning about Africa, specifically, (until high school) was when we learned about the different climate.</p>
<p>BOTH: I feel that one of the themes, this week, was the idea of seeing life through through a tunnel. As Americans, we may not know the customs of other countries/continents or what other countries/continents may actually be like. In both classes, we got a glimpse into that. In ELL we talked about the cultural normative regarding fluid conversations and speech-something that we may take for granted. And in Geography, we discussed the continent of Africa, and how or perceptions on it may not actually be true. This idea can be true to any country, however we were looking at both from the American point of view, since that is what we know the best.</p>
