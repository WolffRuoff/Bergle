					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Great job here, and terrific analysis about the power struggle between distributors and exhibitors in the movie industry!  Of course, the real reason that the major studios are launching new at-home exhibition for their films shortly after their theatrical release is to blunt the power of the elephant in the room: Netflix.  If they can release the film before their contracted release window with Netflix, then the studios will have effectively done an end-run around Netflix and, hopefully for them, they will lessen Netflix&#039;s exhibition power.  Great job here!&lt;/p&gt;
