					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;This was great to read Mike. I have googled myself too many times before this activity. Before I got to high school when I googled my name I just found other people and nothing of me besides maybe a profile picture on facebook. It was interesting to though to see what other people with the same name are doing once you finally decide to look at them. It does take awhile to finally look at them though. I agree with you I am very comfortable and okay with what comes up when people google my name I have nothing to hide. Definitely going to follow in your footsteps and google myself more and make sure nothing negative comes up under my name.&lt;/p&gt;
