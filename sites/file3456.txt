					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Fascinating article here, Group 3.  You&#039;ve touched on two separate yet important new revenue streams for the motion picture industry.  The first is product placement - the featuring of a specific product or service in the actual content of the film.  Here is the client power making itself known in the industry with a company like Chevrolet.  The second is cross-promotion, as you point out, which includes the all-important merchandising opportunities presented by films.  These are yet more methods of making up for lost revenue from lackluster ticket sales and thereby reducing the risks of producing ever more expensive movies.&lt;/p&gt;
