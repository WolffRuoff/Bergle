								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There wasn’t a time in High School that I wasn’t using an IPad or even a computer, I was always attached to some kind of screen I never really was able to get a break. Every homework assignment that I had, had to be done on my IPad and sometimes a computer. I would sit in class looking at a smart board and then writing down the notes on my IPad. By the time I was done with school and my homework I didn’t even want to look at my my phone or TV because I couldn’t stand looking at screens.</p>
<p>When looking at different books on IPads the one that really struck me was “Routledge Research in Early Childhood Education: IPads in the Early Years: Developing Literacy and creativity.” By Dezuanni, Dooley and Gattenhof. The whole concept of the book had to do with children developing with IPads and how they can use them for learning at a young age. Chapter seven focused on Preschools letting parents take home IPads for there children to use for learning. They would have to bring them back but they first teach the parents all about them and how to use them. Then they tell them what their children would be using them for.</p>
<p>This does sound like a nice way to have kids learn in a fun way but children shouldn’t be looking at screens at such a young age. Kids should be learning in a normal class room setting with paper and white boards and we should be teaching kids how to write in cursive not learning how to use a IPad. Even though its something that I only happening at home and not for a long time kids shouldn’t be learning IPads or any kind of small device until there older.</p>
<p>Kids should be playing with toys and going outside not looking at screens they need to build their imagination. They wont fully be able to do that when looking at a device, and playing video games.</p>
<p>The teachers didn’t really see much of a difference from the kids who did use IPads at home verse the kids who didn’t use IPads. The one thing that they did notice is that when the teacher pulled the IPads out for a class activity the kids who used them at home knew how to use and the kids who don’t use it at home had a little bit of a hard time.</p>
<p>My old school is a Pre-K – Twelve school so when we started using IPads in the high school they decided that the middle school and lower school should use them. They haven’t suggested that the little kids use them yet. I would find it absolutely crazy is they made Pre-K and Kindergarten kids use IPads for learning. Kids need to just play with each other and learn to socialize.</p>
