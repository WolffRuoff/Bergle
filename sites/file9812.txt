			<p>Muhlenberg welcomes five Johns Hopkins teams for some key games on Homecoming Weekend. Plus, the cross country teams have a race just a few blocks from campus.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-104" title="Mule Marquee Matchup" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="237" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg 350w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1-300x203.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" /></a>Football vs. Johns Hopkins (Saturday, 2:00)</strong></p>
<p>Johns Hopkins vs. Muhlenberg is always one of the big games in Centennial Conference football, and this year is no exception. Both teams have dominated their first three opponents, the Blue Jays outscoring them 119-35 and the Mules 81-7.</p>
<p>Hopkins, ranked 16th in one Division III poll and 24th in another, brings in a regular-season winning streak of 17 games. Muhlenberg has won six straight at home, the last three by shutout.</p>
<p>The Mules are the only Division III team to have played three games this season and allowed no more than one touchdown. (In all NCAA divisions, the only other schools to do that are Division II Indiana (Pa.) and FBS Florida State.) They&#8217;ll be challenged to keep that streak alive against a Blue Jay offense that averages nearly 500 yards per game.</p>
<p>The winner of this game has gone on to play in the NCAA Tournament every year but one since 2001.</p>

<p>Live television: Service Electric TV2</p>
<p><strong>Field Hockey vs. Johns Hopkins (Friday, 7:00)</strong></p>
<p>Two teams coming off losses to nationally ranked opponents look to get back on the winning track. The Mules (4-2, 1-1) fell to No. 12 Haverford, 2-0, on Wednesday, while the Blue Jays (3-3, 0-1) lost to No. 1 New Jersey, 5-1, on Sunday. Hopkins also dropped its CC opener to Washington, 2-1 in overtime.</p>
<p>The Blue Jays lead the all-time series, 16-5, but Muhlenberg&#8217;s last two wins came in 2008 and 2009 when Hopkins was ranked in the top 10 in Division.III.</p>

<p>Muhlenberg looks to avoid going to 0-3 in the CC against a Johns Hopkins team that is ranked sixth in Division III and has won 14 straight CC games. The last loss before that streak started was in the last meeting in Allentown; the Mules beat Blue Jay teams ranked in the top 10 in both 2009 and 2010.</p>

Muhlenberg, ranked seventh in the Mid-Atlantic Region, is winless (0-5-2) against Hopkins since 2005, although only one of those games was decided by more than one goal.</p>

			<p><em>Not all of Muhlenberg&#8217;s campus will be packing up and heading to McDaniel tomorrow &#8211; just most of the fall athletes. Except for football, the teams will be playing their Centennial Conference openers, so it&#8217;s a big day. Here&#8217;s a look at the matchups, in order of game time:</em></p>
<p><strong>Volleyball at McDaniel (Saturday, 12:00); vs. Goucher (Saturday, 2:00)</strong></p>
<p>Two teams on the rise will try to get a leg up on the CC season. McDaniel (3-6) has already surpassed its win total from all last season, when it went 0-25, and Muhlenberg (6-3) is closing in on its 2011 total of 10 wins. McDaniel leads the all-time series, 15-5, but the teams have split the last four years, with all of those matches ending in 3-0 sweeps.</p>

<p><strong>Men&#8217;s Soccer at McDaniel (Saturday, 1:00)</strong></p>
<p>The regionally ranked Mules (3-1) rebounded from their first loss of the season to knock off Moravian, 5-0, on Wednesday. McDaniel is 2-3. Muhlenberg&#8217;s 31-7-1 all-time series lead includes a 16-2-1 mark in CC contests. The Mules are undefeated (9-0-1) in the last 10 meetings with the Green Terror, but from 2005 to 2009 the games were all decided by one goal, and the score was 2-0 the last two years.</p>

<p><strong>Football at McDaniel (Saturday, 2:00)</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg opened CC play with a 21-0 win against Franklin &amp; Marshall last week; McDaniel, the only winless school in the league, lost to Moravian, 21-7. Bair Stadium used to be a house of horrors for the Mules, who went from 1990 to 2006 without winning there, but they&#8217;ve captured their last two games in Westminster. The Green Terror leads the all-time series, 22-17-3.</p>
<p>Through two games, Muhlenberg leads the CC in pass efficiency (146.3 rating), while McDaniel is last in pass efficiency defense (164.8).</p>

<p><strong>Women&#8217;s Soccer at McDaniel (Saturday, 4:00)</strong></p>
<p>McDaniel is off to a 3-0 start for the first time in 10 seasons. Muhlenberg is 2-3-1 following Wednesday&#8217;s 3-0 loss to No. 4 Messiah. The Mules are 7-0-1 in their last eight games against the Green Terror with six straight wins.</p>

<p><strong>Field Hockey at McDaniel (Saturday, 6:30)</strong></p>
<p>The grand finale matches up two teams looking to return to the CC playoffs. Muhlenberg is 3-1 for the first time since 2007, when it last qualified for the playoffs, and received votes in the national poll. McDaniel is 3-2 and averaging 3.0 goals per game; the Mules have allowed only five goals in four games. Muhlenberg leads 10-9 in a series in which the road team has won the last three meetings.</p>

<p><strong>Men&#8217;s Golf at Guy W. Kuhn Invitational (Sunday and Monday)</strong></p>

			<p><em>The second weekend of the 2012-13 athletic year features a volleyball tournament, a throwback soccer rematch, two spring teams opening up competition &#8230; and the football home opener with a coach going for a major milestone.</em></p>
<p><strong>Football vs. Franklin &amp; Marshall (Saturday, 1:00)</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-104" title="Mule Marquee Matchup" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="237" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg 350w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1-300x203.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" /></a>It&#8217;s the home opener for Muhlenberg and the Centennial Conference opener for both teams. The CC promises to be especially competitive this year after going 7-3 in non-conference games last week. Included in that record are the Mules&#8217; 27-7 win at The Apprentice School and the Diplomats&#8217; last-second 35-28 win against a Washington and Lee team that was 8-2 last year.</p>
<p>The defenses will be on alert to stop three hot quarterbacks. F&amp;M&#8217;s E.J. Schneider was named CC player of the week after throwing for 270 yards and rushing for 110, while Muhlenberg QBs Dan Deighan and Joe Carlucci combined to pass for 337 yards.</p>
<p>F&amp;M leads the all-time series, 52-42-1, although the Mules won last year&#8217;s matchup, 34-13.</p>
<p>Mule head coach Mike Donnelly enters the game with a career record of 99-61 and goes for his 100th win against John Troxell, who was his assistant at Muhlenberg for four years before taking the head reins at F&amp;M.</p>

<p>Coming off its rousing five-set win against DeSales on Wednesday, Muhlenberg hosts the 15th Buttermaker Tournament. The Mules (4-1) are seeking their first title since 2005. This year&#8217;s nine-team field includes defending champion Moravian as well as Salisbury, a team that went 32-4 last year and is currently receiving votes in the AVCA Division III poll.</p>

<p>One of the biggest wins in program history came in 1995, when the Mules beat Ithaca 4-0 in an NCAA quarterfinal game at Varsity Field to advance to the &#8220;Final Four.&#8221; Nothing of the sort is at stake here, although Muhlenberg (2-0) is ranked 11th in Division III. Ithaca is 1-1-1.</p>

			<p>It&#8217;s opening weekend of the 2012-13 season, and all seven Muhlenberg fall sports teams are in action &#8211; three at home, three others close by and one in Virginia. Here&#8217;s a quick look:</p>
<p><strong>Men&#8217;s Soccer vs. Elizabethtown (Friday, 5:00); vs. Cortland State (Saturday, 5:00)</strong></p>
<p>The Mules (10-6-1 last year) renew an old rivalry with Elizabethtown (10-7) in their season opener. In the late 1980s and early-to-mid 1990s, Muhlenberg and Elizabethtown were two of the &#8220;Big Three&#8221; (along with Messiah) of the Mid-Atlantic Region. The Blue Jays were the visitors for the first night game at Varsity Field in 1997. The teams haven&#8217;t met since 2008. Muhlenberg did play Cortland State (3-8-5) last year, winning 3-2.</p>

<p><strong>Women&#8217;s Soccer vs. Wilkes (Friday, 7:00); vs. Penn State Altoona (Saturday, 7:00)</strong></p>
<p>The Mules open their season against two teams that were in the postseason last year. Wilkes (8-6-3) made the Freedom Conference playoffs, while Penn State Altoona (14-5-3) lost the Allegheny Mountain Collegiate Conference championship game on penalty kicks and earned a bid to the ECAC South Tournament. After this weekend, Muhlenberg (6-10-2) has six straight road games over the next three weeks.</p>

<p><strong>Field Hockey vs. Scranton (Friday, 7:00); vs. Elizabethtown (Saturday, 2:00)</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg (5-12) played the same two opponents on opening weekend last year, losing to both on the road. Scranton was 12-6 last season, and Elizabethtown was 10-7, with both falling in the first round of their conference playoffs.</p>

<p><strong>Volleyball at Greyhound Premiere Invitational (starts Friday at 4:00)</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg (10-18 last year) starts the season with matches against Wilkes (3-22), King&#8217;s (3-20), Wesley (5-26) and host Moravian (23-13). The last time the Mules were in this tournament, 2008, they went 3-1 to finish in second place.</p>

<p><strong>Cross Country at Lehigh Invitational (Friday, 5:30)</strong></p>
<p>For the ninth straight year, the Mules open up at Lehigh&#8217;s Goodman Campus Course in a field that includes Division I opponents Lehigh, Lafayette and Mount St. Mary&#8217;s. Last year, Samantha Mayden was the top Division III runner in the women&#8217;s race, coming in seventh overall.</p>
<p><strong>Football at The Apprentice School (Saturday, 1:00)</strong></p>
<p>The last time the Mules were scheduled to play a regular-season game in Newport News (at Christopher Newport in 2003), the game was cancelled by Hurricane Isabel. No danger of that this year as Muhlenberg (7-3 last year) opens its 111th season with its first game ever against the Builders (2-8).</p>

We were all dressed in <a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/SpecialOlympics3.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-969" title="Special Olympics" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/SpecialOlympics3.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="245" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/SpecialOlympics3.jpg 350w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/SpecialOlympics3-300x210.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" /></a>Muhlenberg t-shirts, but many of the athletes were dressed in St. Patrick’s Day attire. One of the staff members even had a green beard! Still, we were welcomed with open arms by the staff, athletes and the local Girl Scouts who were helping out as well.</p>
<p>The staff seemed stressed from the beginning and we were a bit nervous. The reason behind this tension was because there were 96 bowlers that we had to keep track of! Bowlers were either playing individually against other bowlers in the same lane, or there were two teams that were competing against each other in opposing lanes. It was handled pretty smoothly, though, as the competition started at 1:00 on the dot.</p>
<p>The national anthem was played after the reciting of the Special Olympics Oath:</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Let me win, but if I cannot win, let me be brave in the attempt.”</strong></p>
<p>It was pretty powerful to hear all of the athletes say this oath before they began bowling. It represented a lot of what Special Olympics Lehigh County is about, where their philosophy asserts the athletic spirit of courage and joy, as well as giving those with disabilities the opportunity to share their skills and friendship with the community as a whole. Special Olympics Lehigh County provides year-round sports competitions, such as for basketball, gymnastics, track and field and more, for adults and children of a variety of ages. For this event specifically, the bowling winners had the chance to advance to different competitions, so it was safe to say that the contest was fierce from the get-go.</p>
<p>Coach and Kate were assigned to keep score for the lanes that had a battle between two teams. Erica, Brittany and I were placed on reward duty, so we got the chance to sit back and watch a couple games before we had to turn on our math brains to add up the scores.</p>
<p>The bowlers were allowed to practice a bit before the scoring started. We were a little confused to see how even though they were on different teams, they switched back and forth to each other’s lanes between turns. I could see Coach starting to get uncomfortable because we all didn’t really know what was going on. Coach asked one of the bowlers, Christina, to explain the switching of lanes. She claimed that this is what they have been doing for weeks, so they knew that what they were doing was correct.</p>
<p>Christina went on to explain how the bowling event that we attended was actually the end of an eight-week series, where bowlers competed every weekend since sometime in January. Bowlers that were at this event were allowed to compete to move onto the next competition if they were present at at least five of the eight weekend events. With this being said, the athletes took control, and quickly moved from the practice round onto their competing games.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/SpecialOlympics4.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-970" title="Special Olympics" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/SpecialOlympics4.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="264" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/SpecialOlympics4.jpg 400w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/SpecialOlympics4-300x198.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></a>It was fun to walk back and forth between games to see how well they were doing. One of the bowlers, David, was angry about one of his scores, 130-something mind you, which is way higher than I would ever get personally. I told him I celebrate when I break 100 and he laughed at me.</p>
<p>It was certain that these athletes were in it to win it, although the more serious bowlers were also balanced with those who were there just to have a good time. It showed because they were the ones that were making jokes with us and taking pictures with us. <a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/SpecialOlympics2.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-971" title="Special Olympics" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/SpecialOlympics2.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/SpecialOlympics2.jpg 400w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/SpecialOlympics2-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></a>Kate especially looked like she was having a great time, as she was surrounded by two teams of all happy-go-lucky bowlers. All in all, it was fun to take photos, laugh, and just watch and learn as they racked up impressive scores.</p>
<p>At the end, Erica, Brittany and I were in charge of adding up the scores and distributing the ribbons. I think Erica would agree when I write thank goodness for calculators! The scores were added and a ribbon was presented to each bowler representing first, second, third or fourth place, with their names and individual scores written on the back.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/SpecialOlympics1.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-972" title="Special Olympics" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/SpecialOlympics1.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/SpecialOlympics1.jpg 400w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/SpecialOlympics1-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></a>It was an amazing feeling to see how excited they were to receive their ribbons from Brittany for any place that they got. It really allowed me to think back about why I started playing sports in the first place: for the happiness I feel because of it.</p>
<p>Kate Clawson said, “Overall, the experience at the Special Olympics bowling event this Saturday was very rewarding. Interacting with the athletes was awesome. They were all such great sports and that’s something I really admired about them, as they admired us for volunteering our time.”</p>
<p>I think generally we were just happy to interact with each other, especially on such a fun holiday and a beautiful day. It was something that I’ll always remember, and wouldn’t hesitate to do it again.</p>

			<p><em>The Centennial Conference hosted the 13th annual Snell-Shillingford Symposium at Haverford last weekend. Female athlete representatives and coaches from the conference’s member schools participated in sessions designed to empower women in the coaching profession and to encourage them to take up the legacy of those who have gone before them.</em></p>
<p><em>Muhlenberg was represented at the three-day event by two coaches, Cindy Wilson (assistant lacrosse) and Rhonwen Peters (assistant field hockey), who attended as a presenter and mentor, respectively, and two </em><em>senior athletes, Davi Gordon (volleyball) and Jessica Shegoski (lacrosse).</em></p>
<p><em>Here is what Gordon had to say about her experience:</em></p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/gordonhs2.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-67" title="Davi Gordon" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/gordonhs2.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>… Students and coaches from each school in the Centennial Conference attended this all-female conference to learn, share and present about women in sports and coaching. Various coaches and representatives from the conference presented about the history of Title IX, the different responsibilities a coach may have, creating a practice and season plan, developing a coaching philosophy, and sportsmanship and ethics in coaching.</p>
<p>I wanted to attend this symposium because I have a passion for volleyball, and with graduation quickly approaching, I know that I want to continue to keep the sport as a major part of my life. Although I’m not sure what level I ultimately want to coach, this conference definitely confirmed my desire to coach volleyball in the future.  I have had some great (and not so good) coaches in the past, and I think that my coaches have helped me develop into the person I am today. I would love to be able to have the same impact on other girls, and being able to see their progress will be very rewarding!</p>
<p><em>And Shegoski gave this insight into the Symposium:</em></p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/02/shegoskihs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-781" title="Jessica Shegoski" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/02/shegoskihs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>The Snell-Shillingford Symposium is a weekend full of education and fun. I attended the Symposium because I have always had a love for coaching and teaching a sport I love to other girls. It’s a great feeling to see their eyes light up when they master a new concept and fall in love with the game. This is also the reason that I am considering a career coaching either at the college or high school level.</p>
<p>I learned so much throughout the weekend, not only about sports and females, but also about myself.</p>
<p>During one of the sessions, presented by the Bryn Mawr soccer coach Erin DeMarco, we did a personality test that grouped you into colors (Davi, Cindy and I were Blues). These colors gave insight into our personalities; there were the builders, the planners, the realtors and the adventurers. Erin then let us know how each of these personalities got along during a LONG road trip.</p>
<p>The builders were the one who had already loaded the directions into the GPS that was of course already set up on the dash, read the directions a couple times online, printed out the Google Maps version of the directions, and just in case none of those worked packed the 50 state atlas in the back of the car. They also have already mapped out the trip down the minute (including bathroom stops).</p>
<p>The planners are the ones at the hood of the car with the atlas spread out. They are looking at the route printed by the builders and thinking to themselves “well what if we instead took this road, it would add 10 minutes but we would hit traffic, or this road we wouldn’t have to pay a toll but again more mileage.” The planners are not going to be ready to leave until every possibility is looked over.</p>
<p>Then there are the relators (Davi, Cindy and I). We are the “moms” of the group, and we are already sitting in the car with a snack packed for each person in the group, making sure that no one is hungry and trying to find out how everyone’s day is going so far, while at the same time trying to make sure everyone is comfortable for the long trip ahead.</p>
<p>Lastly, there are the adventurers. These are your friends who are always last minute (you know you are thinking of that person right now). They come running up the driveway two minutes before the builder has planned to leave (pan to the builder constantly checking their watch), throwing their duffel into the trunk and screaming, “road trip here we come.”</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/02/snell_symposium.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-782" title="Snell Symposium" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/02/snell_symposium.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="223" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/02/snell_symposium.jpg 450w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/02/snell_symposium-300x148.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a>As we sat and listened to Erin describe this scenario we all realized that we were the person that she was describing and that we could place our teammates and friends into the other roles, which helped us to learn the best ways to work within a team and thrive as a team.</p>
<p>Overall the Symposium was a fun, long, amazing weekend that I would tell any female athlete in the Centennial Conference to attend if they even have the slightest draw towards coaching in the future. And that doesn’t mean you have to want to coach at the college or high school level &#8211; the pee wee leagues matter just as much.</p>
<p><em>The above picture of Shegoski (in pink sweater) and Gordon (to her right) at one of the sessions was taken by a former Muhlenberg Symposium attendee &#8211; Jamie Gluck &#8217;03, head women&#8217;s soccer coach at Haverford.</em></p>

			<p>This fall, the members of Muhlenberg’s Student Athlete Mentors (S.A.M.) teamed with the Mule field hockey team to raise money for breast cancer research.</p>
<p>S.A.M. sold “Think Pink” t-shirts, and the field hockey team sold wristbands and took donations during its “Think Pink” game in October. All told, they raised $870 for Susan G. Komen for the Cure.</p>
<p>They recently posed for a picture with a check in Parents Plaza.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/11/SAM-think-pink.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-525" title="Think Pink check" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/11/SAM-think-pink.jpg" alt="" width="655" height="252" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/11/SAM-think-pink.jpg 655w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/11/SAM-think-pink-300x115.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/11/SAM-think-pink-500x192.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 655px) 100vw, 655px" /></a></p>
<p>“We wanted to try to do our part to help out, and we want to say a big thank you to everyone who helped out by either buying a shirt or making a donation,” S.A.M. president and Mule volleyball player Jackie Price said. “Almost everyone has been affected by breast cancer in some way, and this was our way of trying to help.”</p>

			<p>The last full weekend of the fall season has two teams competing for Centennial Conference championships and another trying to earn a playoff spot.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-46" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="237" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee.jpg 350w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee-300x203.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" /></a>Men’s Soccer vs. Ursinus (Saturday, 11:00)</strong></p>
<p>The Mules (9-5-1, 5-3) are in a three-way tie for third place in the CC with Franklin &amp; Marshall and Swarthmore. They need a win or a tie to clinch a spot in the CC playoffs for the 11th straight year.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg is undefeated (5-0-1) at home this season and undefeated (25-0-2) against Ursinus since 1985. The Bears (3-11-3, 2-5-1) have already played spoiler once this season, defeating then-No. 9 Swarthmore two weeks ago.</p>

<p><strong>Cross Country at Centennial Conference Championships (Saturday, 11:00)</strong></p>
<p>Dickinson is the host for the first CC championship event of the 2011-12 school year. The Mule women are ranked fifth in the region and will look to improve on their sixth-place finish of a year ago. The men also were sixth in 2010.</p>
<p><strong>Football vs. Dickinson (Saturday, 1:00)</strong></p>
<p>It may be Family Weekend at Muhlenberg, but it will feel like Homecoming for the football team, which has not played at home in four weeks. Turnovers could play a role in the outcome, as the Mules (4-3, 4-2) lead the CC with 22 takeaways and the Red Devils (3-4, 3-3) have a league-high 22 giveaways.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg leads the all-time series 39-25-2. In the last two games at Scotty Wood Stadium, a team came back from at least 16 points down to win.</p>

			<p>As the regular season for fall sports comes to an end, we will be taking a closer look at Muhlenberg’s senior student-athletes.</p>
<p>In the coming days, the MuhlBox will feature some of the highlights from the traditional <a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/seniorbanner.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-369 alignright" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/seniorbanner.jpg" alt="" width="360" height="309" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/seniorbanner.jpg 360w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/seniorbanner-300x257.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/seniorbanner-349x300.jpg 349w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" /></a>senior question and answer profiles that run with the programs for Senior Day. So be sure to check back next week when we will profile the seniors from the field hockey, football, and men’s and women’s soccer teams.</p>
<p>We start with volleyball, which beat Ursinus, 3-1, in its final home match on Wednesday. Seniors Davi Gordon, Brooke McQueen and Jackie Price were honored before the game and then played important roles in the win.</p>

<p><strong>What did it feel like playing at Gordon College seeing your name plastered all over the place? </strong>I never really thought about that, but now that you mention it, I guess it was pretty cool! When I was in third grade, I did convince one of my best friends that Jeff Gordon was my uncle, so maybe people will believe me if I tell them the college was named after my family…</p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans? </strong>I am that senior that is not exactly sure what I want to do come May! I think my parents have already changed the locks and turned my bedroom into a workout area, so I should probably figure it out soon. I’m not sure if I want to start coaching and/or work in an office, so I’m just going to go with the flow! I would love to travel the world and visit more countries. But at this point, my minimal funds will probably only get me to the nearest Wawa.</p>
<p><strong>What kind of person is Jackie Price? </strong>Jackie is not only a great teammate, but she is also an amazing friend and roommate! Both on and off the court, Jackie is super competitive and supportive. She is a natural leader and pushes everyone to work their hardest and do their best. I have the utmost faith and trust in her and know that she will get the job done. With a microphone always in hand, or at least close by, Jackie never ceases to be able to make me laugh with her made-up song lyrics, her impeccable barrel rolling, her love of noodles (xoxo) and her flawless peace sign. YEAHBUDDY!</p>

<p><strong>Are you a fan of the movie <em>Cars</em>? Is Lightning McQueen a longlost automotive relative?  </strong>I get this question a lot! And to many people’s disappointment, I have never even seen the movie! However, I would say that Lightning McQueen and I are long, lost siblings since we both have lightning fast speed!</p>
<p><strong>You’ve had internships at a physician’s office and St. Luke’s Hospital; what were those experiences like? </strong>…<strong> </strong>I have seen C-sections, open heart surgery, eye surgery and total knee replacements, to name a few! Having these experiences where I got to have a front row seat to watch were once-in-a-lifetime-opportunities. The joy and excitement that I got from having these experiences has helped me decide to go into the health care field after graduating.</p>
<p><strong>What kind of teammate is Davi Gordon? </strong>Dav, Davs, Dovensauce, Davilicious, Davicreature, Creatch … How do I describe this girl in one short paragraph? Being not only my teammate, but also best friend since freshman year, Davi makes up one third of the friendship that us seniors have. We refer to ourselves as “the 3/3rds.” Honestly though, Davi is one of the best teammates you could ever ask for. She is a pillar of unending optimism on and off the court. Davi is always there at just the right moment to remind you to smile, breathe or simply pass the ball. She is also there to mop the floor up when even the tiniest drop of sweat may fall! Davi is always sure to make everyone on the team feel included, and that is a valuable attribute that not all teams have. Davi has been a great teammate and an even better friend for the last four years, and I can’t even believe how fast the time has gone!</p>

<p><strong><img class="alignleft" src="http://www.muhlenberg.edu/images/main/athletics/women/volleyball/hs/vb11/pricehs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" />Jackie Price</strong></p>
<p><strong>What was it like studying abroad in Geneva last spring? </strong>It was definitely one of the highlights of my college career. We attended lectures at the UN, Red Cross and World Health Organization, which taught me so much about public health. Our program took us to Morocco for two weeks, where I lived with another student from my program with a family that spoke no English. We had to communicate via the little French we had learned, but we did create long-lasting relationships with our family there.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans? </strong>I plan to go to physician’s assistants school. I have worked as a medical assistant and am participating in the St. Luke’s shadow program (yes, the same one Brooke did last year since we are basically the same person). I have had great practice thanks to Davi, who seems to have come down with almost every injury and illness there is. From bone bruises to bulging disks, she always keeps me and Brooke, the “PA roomies,” on the edge of our seats trying to figure out what is wrong.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s Brooke McQueen like off the court? </strong>Brooke is a very energetic, outgoing, hard-working and great friend and roommate!! In addition to her positivity on the court, she is always smiling and more than willing to help out one of her friends. I am so glad that I have become so close with her. After living with her for the past three years, she has become one of my best friends. Whether it is in volleyball, academics or our social lives, we are always able to relate to each other and share a laugh. She works extremely hard, and I admire her for how well she is able to multitask and succeed in all that she does.</p>

			<p><em>Fall is in the air as the fall seasons come to a close &#8211; it&#8217;s the second-to-last weekend of the regular season for soccer, volleyball and field hockey, and all Mule teams are on the road.</em></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-46" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="237" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee.jpg 350w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee-300x203.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" /></a>Men’s Soccer at Gettysburg (Saturday, 7:00)</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg plays the first of back-to-back crucial Centennial Conference road games under the lights at Gettysburg. The Mules (8-4-1, 4-2) are in a three-way tie for second place in the CC, one point ahead of the Bullets (6-6-1, 3-2-1).</p>
<p>Gettysburg started out 3-0-1 in the CC but has lost its last two games to Swarthmore and Haverford. The Bullets have played six 1-0 games and a 0-0 tie.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg has won three straight CC games following road losses to Johns Hopkins and Swarthmore. Like the Bullets, the Mules have allowed only four goals in six CC games.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg leads the all-time series 33-18-6, including a 12-4-2 margin in CC competition. The Mules have won four straight meetings, the last three by shutout.</p>

<p><strong>Football at Juniata (Saturday, 1:00)</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg looks to rebound from a disappointing loss at Gettysburg last week against a team it has never lost to. In fact, since Juniata joined the Centennial Conference in 2007, it has not scored an offensive touchdown against the Mules. The Eagles come in with an 18-game losing streak.</p>

<p><strong>Volleyball at Gettysburg (Saturday, 12:00); Women’s Soccer at Gettysburg (Saturday, 4:00)</strong></p>
<p>Both Muhlenberg teams need a win to keep their Centennial Conference playoff hopes alive, but it won’t be easy: Gettysburg volleyball is 7-0 in the CC, and the Bullets women’s soccer team is 6-1.</p>

<p><strong>Field Hockey at Gettysburg (Friday, 3:30)</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg looks for its first win at Gettysburg since 1993. The Bullets have won their last three CC games to climb back into the playoff race.</p>
