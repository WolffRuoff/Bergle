			<p><em>In celebration of the NCAA&#8217;s inaugural Division III week, we&#8217;ve had perspectives on the unique Division III experience from a <a title="Division III Week: Faculty Perspective" href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/2012/04/10/division-iii-week-faculty-perspective/">faculty member </a>and a <a title="Division III Week: Coach Perspective" href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/2012/04/11/division-iii-week-coach-perspective/">coach</a> in The MuhlBox this week.</em></p>
<p><em>But it wouldn&#8217;t be Division III without the student-athletes. So we asked a few Muhlenberg athletes what Division III meant to them.</em></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/beckhs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1059" title="Brian Beck" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/beckhs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Brian Beck, Baseball</strong></p>
<p>What playing in Division III means to me is the ability for experiences and opportunities off the field. Although throughout the year, dedication and focus for the upcoming season is key in my mind, Division III allows me the opportunity for other focuses as well. Whether it is from an engaging academic environment or the ability to pursue things such as internships during the year, Division III allows for opportunities both on and off the field, which is what you want as a student athlete.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/meolahs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1060" title="Alyssa Meola" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/meolahs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Alyssa Meola, Women&#8217;s Soccer</strong></p>
<p>Being a Division III athlete means being able to excel in academics and athletics. The great thing about playing at Muhlenberg is that I can be fully invested in soccer, as well as academics, clubs and other organizations on campus. Besides being able to participate in a variety of different activities, I love that as a Division III athlete, I&#8217;m playing with other athletes who still play because they love the game. None of us have athletic scholarships, and most of us will never get drafted to play professionally. But, we continue to play for our love of the game, which I find to be humbling. It&#8217;s exciting to look around the field, and see that you&#8217;re playing a game with all your best friends, who are working hard for each other.</p>
<p>We play Division III because we have flexibility to pursue other activities, and because we love the game, and need it in our lives because it is such a strong part of who we are, and most of us could not live without it.</p>

<p>I chose to play DIII after seeing what my sister went through playing at the DI level. I wanted to go to a small school that had good education, but was also very competitive with athletics. DI programs make playing a sport your job, and I wanted to have a life outside of sports. What made DIII appealing to me is that I could do other things and still have time to focus on school.</p>

<p><em>Yesterday, mathematics/computer science professor Michael Huber gave a <a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/?p=1042">faculty perspective</a>.</em></p>
<p><em>Today&#8217;s guest writer is Marisa DeStasio, head coach of the Muhlenberg softball team. DeStasio is in her second season with the Mules; in her first, she coached the team to the Centennial Conference championship. Like Dr. Huber, who taught at Army before coming to Muhlenberg, DeStasio has a Division I background.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/destasiohs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1052" title="Marisa DeStasio" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/destasiohs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>It is August and finally sunny in the southern tier of New York. Although it is a warm day, the sweat dripping down my forehead is not because of the sun. I am standing on the starting line of the track with my teammates, most of whom I barely know yet. “Go!” screamed my new coach, so I ran and I ran and I ran. I ran for an entire mile! Yes, all 5,280 feet!</p>
<p>I was freshman at Binghamton University and a new member of the softball team. It was the point in my life when my biggest stressor was running the timed mile. I can still feel the nervousness flowing through my body on that day. In hindsight, I realize running a mile is not a big deal and really not all that challenging, but give me a break… I was a naïve freshman.  The month and a half of our fall season had just begun and so had a new school year.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/destasio1.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1053" title="Marisa DeStasio" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/destasio1.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="515" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/destasio1.jpg 250w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/destasio1-145x300.jpg 145w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px" /></a>During the fall, we had practice every day with tournaments on the weekends until the end of October. Three times a week we were also required to lift with our strength coach. However, the end of the fall marked the beginning of our offseason training regimen. Monday through Friday we had either 7 a.m. conditioning or lifting sessions and then individual skill workouts with our coaches in the afternoon. We had a countdown in the locker room of when our next dreaded conditioning day was, so we could mentally prepare ourselves for sprint torture.</p>
<p>Over winter break we were given a lifting and conditioning workout packet. Upon our return, we would “max out” with the strength coach and once again run the dreaded mile with the goal of beating our previous time from the fall. (Thankfully, I always did.) It was comforting when spring practice finally started because all our hard work would pay off soon.</p>
<p>In Division I, you get the chance to travel all over the country, albeit mostly on a smelly, bumpy charter bus. Sometimes you drive sixteen hours in one weekend and live in a hotel room just to get beat up on by nationally ranked teams. Our goal every year was the same, make the America East Conference Tournament. We may have come up shy, but it did not make my experience at Binghamton any less rewarding. It was certainly not glamorous and you often ask yourself why you do it. The answer is always the same, because you love to play the sport.</p>
<p>After working with student-athletes at Muhlenberg for the last three years, I realize some of the similarities and differences between divisions have nothing to do with skill. This campus has shown me the true meaning of “student-athlete.”</p>
<p>Being a Division I athlete is like having a job, with little time for anything else other than classes and your sport. At the time, I was not interested in expanding my horizons beyond softball and certainly could not fathom life after Binghamton. I should have been more focused on my future.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/destasio2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1054" title="softball team" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/destasio2.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="158" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/destasio2.jpg 500w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/destasio2-300x94.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>This cannot be said for the student-athletes at Muhlenberg. Everyone here is committed to success both in academics and athletics. And from what I can tell, it comes from pure self-motivation. They work extremely hard in the classroom and then on the field, while also striving to make a difference in the community. They wake up early for practice, they sprint just as hard, they are just as competitive, and they hate running the mile just as much as I did. The bottom line is they want to win.</p>
<p>In the end, it does not matter what division you play because the ultimate goal is an education. A mile is still 5,280 feet, and we all play for love of the sport.</p>

The week celebrates the unique Division III student-athlete experience, which offers a highly competitive athletics environment, a commitment to academic excellence and time to pursue other interests. </em></p>
<p><em>We will look at the Division III experience from three different perspectives this week in The MuhlBox. The first comes from Michael Huber, an associate professor in Muhlenberg&#8217;s Department of Mathematics and Computer Science.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/mike_huber.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1044" title="Michael Huber" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/mike_huber.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>It’s time to come clean. I like sports. Not specifically one sport, but just about all sports. I am also a member of the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science. </p>
<p>Sometimes it appears that the two groups (sports fan and faculty member) are not compatible, but in reality, the intersection of the two groups is the set of students we have.</p>
<p>Before I arrived at Muhlenberg, I taught for nine years at the United States Military Academy. I was also an Officer Representative to the Army baseball team. An “OR” is a fancy term for a faculty member who was part of the administrative group supporting a specific team. Our mission was to be at every game in the dugout, to support the team as a role model, but never to coach. To root for the guys on the squad but also to assist them academically (and it seemed that some Army baseball players always needed help with mathematics). I got to know the players really well, as I was usually in the dugout or in the stands for most of those games, including spring break trips to Florida and away trips to other Patriot League schools.</p>
<p>Now, at Muhlenberg, I am the faculty liaison for our volleyball team. We created the faculty liaison program a few years ago to connect faculty members with specific sports programs. Some of my math colleagues are faculty liaisons to our women’s basketball team. Again, my role is to be a fan. I attend many home games, but I have also traveled to away trips, including a five-day trip to Texas, but usually to Centennial Conference opponents. I have given exams to students in the hotel conference room when the players missed a biology or calculus exam back in Allentown. Academics is a priority for our sports programs.</p>
<p>The Division III athletes we have at Muhlenberg are just as competitive as the D-I athletes at West Point, in that they are passionate about their sports, practice hard, try to successfully balance academics with intercollegiate sports, and have an unwavering loyalty to their coach and teammates. </p>
<p>The level of competition might be different between the two divisions, but the drive to succeed is just as fierce. </p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/D3week_vb.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1045" title="volleyball celebration" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/D3week_vb.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="291" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/D3week_vb.jpg 500w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/D3week_vb-300x174.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>I was fortunate to get to know several Army players who were selected in the Major League Baseball First Year Player Draft each June. These young men were able to play professional baseball before serving our country as leaders in the U.S. Army.</p>
<p>At Muhlenberg, I have also been fortunate to know several young women who, as the NCAA commercial tells us, “will go pro in something other than sports.” These ladies are leaders on and off the court. They are peer tutors for the Academic Resource Center, earning secondary education certificates in addition to their majors, studying abroad to enrich their lifelong learning, and receiving accolades for being on the Dean’s List. I see them around campus all the time. Although they will probably not be professional or Olympic volleyball stars, they will still be successful after graduation.   </p>
<p>Students want us to get involved. I honestly believe that they appreciate seeing us in the stands or mentioning their names in connection with being on the ‘Berg webpage when they come to class. I like to take copies of our school newspaper and give it to my students who adorn the back page of the Sports section. I usually tell them to “send it home to Grandma,” but it means a great deal to them to be recognized, not only by the school, but by a teacher in class. Further, the Athletic Department at Muhlenberg tracks each student-athlete and is in communication with the faculty, to ensure that academics remains a priority for all students.</p>
<p>As a parent, I tried to attend as many of my daughter’s high school lacrosse or volleyball games as possible; most parents do as well. As students go away to colleges that are not close to home, their folks are not always able to be in the stands. That’s where faculty members can play crucial roles. Go to a game or match to cheer for students in your class. Yell out a player’s name when she blocks a shot or hits a winner down the line.  Wear your “Go Berg” spirit gear to class before Homecoming. </p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/mike_huber_vb.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1046" title="volleyball huddle" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/mike_huber_vb.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="261" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/mike_huber_vb.jpg 500w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/mike_huber_vb-300x156.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>At Muhlenberg, we have a Guest Coach program, where players ask coaches to invite their teachers to be on the bench during a match or game. I was the guest coach for a softball game three years ago when our pitcher no-hit Gettysburg College’s softball team. I was as excited as the Mule players, and my enthusiasm for their performance showed my genuine support for them. </p>
<p>I try to attend as many athletic events as possible, and I encourage other members of the faculty to support our players. Go Mules!</p>

			<p>In the third inning of the Muhlenberg softball team’s game at McDaniel, a Mule fan looked toward the on-deck circle and said, “Oh, Kelly’s up next, I need to get my front row seat,” before hurrying to the first row of the bleachers.</p>
<p>That’s because when the sophomore first baseman steps to the plate, it is more than just an at-bat, it’s a chance to witness history.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/kline_blog.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1039" title="Kelly Kline" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/kline_blog.jpg" alt="" width="330" height="458" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/kline_blog.jpg 330w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/kline_blog-216x300.jpg 216w" sizes="(max-width: 330px) 100vw, 330px" /></a>Moments after the fan got to his seat, Kline sent a towering shot over the right-center fence for her third straight home run. It was just the latest in what has been a sizzling season for Kline. And her onslaught at McDaniel helped her leave some impressive marks on the school record book.</p>
<p>The three straight blasts, one in the opener and two in game two, not only kept her school-record hitting streak intact at 23 games, but they moved her season home run total to nine, breaking the Mule single-season record of seven set last season by two-time CC player of the year Ashley Brewer.</p>
<p>They also moved her within one of Brewer’s career home run mark of 13 less than two seasons into her career, which Kline could hardly believe.</p>
<p>“I had no idea,” Kline said when told about the season record. “Ashley was a great player; I really looked up to her. She helped me a lot as a freshman. To be mentioned with her is incredible. It means a lot.”</p>
<p>Through games of last Sunday, Kline led the CC and ranked in top five in Division III in batting average (.519) and slugging percentage (1.013). Her 23-game hit streak is five more than the previous Mule record. She’s also two home runs shy of the CC single-season mark.</p>
<p>But wait, there’s more!</p>
<p>Kline needs only one more extra-base hit to tie the program season record of 20, and she currently sits third on the single-season lists for total bases (78, 11 shy of second and 15 away from first) and RBI (34, 2 away from second and 17 shy of first).</p>
<p>There’s more than enough numbers and records to make heads spin. But it’s nothing compared to head spinning that comes from trying to figure out how to get Kline out.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why McDaniel gave Kline the &#8220;Barry Bonds&#8221; treatment in the second game of Saturday&#8217;s doubleheader, walking her intentionally to start the sixth inning despite having a six-run lead.</p>
<p>Kline can hit for both power and average, and she can make things happen when she gets on base, witnessed by her team-high 26 runs scored.</p>
<p>Much of her success comes from the time and effort she puts in every day at practice. Senior Shelby Smith said Kline is the hardest worker on the team, and makes everybody better just by being in the lineup.</p>
<p>“She’s amazing,” Smith said of Kline. “She hits the ball so hard, and you think she’s going to get a hit every time. She’s just a great player and a great teammate.” </p>
<p>But for all the astronomical numbers and tape measure shots she’s been putting up this season, Kline said she just tries to keep things simple when it comes to hitting.</p>
<p>She tries to hit the ball as hard as she can every time up, and if it goes out of the park, all the better, she added.</p>
<p>So while she said the records and accomplishments are nice, she’s far more concerned with team goals. And after winning the conference title as a freshman, she has her sights set high again.</p>
<p>“I didn’t even know how many home runs I have hit, so I don’t think about it. I just wait for a good pitch and try to hit it,” she said. “It’s cool to have records, but it’s just really fun to win. We’ve been playing well, and hopefully we can keep on winning.”</p>

<p>Softball and track and field take the spotlight this weekend.</p>
<p><strong>Softball at McDaniel (Saturday, 1:00)</strong></p>
<p>What makes this the marquee matchup of the weekend? It&#8217;s not just that McDaniel is in first place in the Centennial Conference with an 8-0 record <a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-104" title="Mule Marquee Matchup" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1-300x203.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="203" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1-300x203.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>and Muhlenberg is one of two teams tied for second at 6-2 &#8211; although that certainly is a big part of it.</p>
<p>The two teams have come by their success in extremely different manners. Muhlenberg is hitting .374 and averaging more than nine runs in its eight CC games. Reigning CC player of the week Kelly Kline is hitting .593 with a .963 slugging percentage in CC games .</p>
<p>McDaniel, on the other hand, has done it with pitching, allowing only eight runs in its eight CC games. Reigning CC pitcher of the week Caroline Brehm is 8-0 with a 0.46 ERA and 88 strikeouts in 45.1 innings in CC games.</p>
<p>What will win out, hitting or pitching?</p>

<p><strong>Track &amp; Field hosts Muhlenberg Invitational (Saturday, 10:00)</strong></p>
<p>The Mules welcome 15 other schools for their only home meet of the outdoor season. This meet has been contested in rain and snow in previous years, so the sunshine and mild temperatures should lead to some good performances. Muhlenberg is also sending a handful of runners to Princeton for a distance event Friday night.</p>
<p><strong>Women&#8217;s Lacrosse at McDaniel (Friday, 3:30); Men&#8217;s Lacrosse at McDaniel (Saturday, 1:00)</strong></p>
<p>The Mule lax teams travel to Westminster in search of their first Centennial Conference win of the season. Both teams defeated McDaniel last year, the women 17-6 and the men 8-5. Both Green Terror squads have won just once in the CC.</p>

			<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been a crazy few days.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what sophomore Chelsea Benjamin of the Muhlenberg softball team said following yesterday&#8217;s doubleheader sweep of Haverford. And it was a bit of an understatement.</p>
<p>For better or for worse, the Mules are doing their best to dispel the notion that fastpitch softball is a low-scoring game dominated by pitchers.</p>
<p>On March 23, in the first game of a doubleheader against then-No. 17 (now No. 14) Cortland State, Muhlenberg played what many would consider a traditional college softball game. The game was scoreless after seven innings, after which the teams went to international tiebreaker rules, starting each half inning with a runner on second. The intent is to increase chances for scoring so games do not go on inning after inning with zeroes on the board.</p>
<p>Cortland scored three in the ninth to win that game, and in the 12 days since, there haven&#8217;t been many zeroes on the board when the Mules have played.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/run-scoring.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1030" title="run scoring" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/run-scoring.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="467" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/run-scoring.jpg 250w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/run-scoring-160x300.jpg 160w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px" /></a>Starting with the second game of that twinbill, Muhlenberg&#8217;s final scores in the next eight games were 7-6, 11-5, 11-3, 10-3, 7-6, 9-8, 7-6 and 6-0. In three of the four one-run games, the Mules took a lead of at least four runs into the final inning, losing the lead once and twice ending the game with the tying run on base.</p>
<p>Those eight games averaged more than 13 runs scored. And they were nothing compared to the second game of yesterday&#8217;s doubleheader, won by Muhlenberg, 17-13.</p>
<p>It was the fifth-highest scoring game in team history; the other four came in 1979 and 1980, the first two years of softball at Muhlenberg. The record for runs by both teams is 37, set in a 28-9 win against Moravian in 1980.</p>
<p>The game marked the 11th time in team history that both teams scored in double digits, and most of the first 10 occasions come from the early days of the sport:</p>
<ul>
<li>1979 Allentown 18, Muhlenberg 13</li>
<li>1979 Moravian 22, Muhlenberg 13</li>
<li>1980 Delaware Valley 18, Muhlenberg 17</li>
<li>1981 Kutztown 11, Muhlenberg 10</li>
<li>1982 Wilkes 12, Muhlenberg 11 (MAC championship game)</li>
<li>1983 Lehigh 11, Muhlenberg 10</li>
<li>1988 Lafayette 13, Muhlenberg 12 (8 innings)</li>
<li>1995 Muhlenberg 14, Dickinson 13</li>
<li>2000 Lake Forest 11, Muhlenberg 10 (8 innings)</li>
<li>2011 Wesleyan 12, Muhlenberg 10</li>
<li>2012 Muhlenberg 17, Haverford 13<a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/softball_scoreboard.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1031" title="softball scoreboard" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/softball_scoreboard-300x205.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="205" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/softball_scoreboard-300x205.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/softball_scoreboard.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></li>
</ul>
<p>The good news for the Mules is that they have won most of the high-scoring games this year, and despite all of the drama they are sitting in good position in the Centennial Conference with a 6-2 record. They are averaging more than nine runs in their eight CC games and have reached double figures four times &#8211; as many times as they did in the last four years combined. The school record for scoring in double figures in CC games is eight times, set in 1994, the first year of the league.</p>
<p>And in case yesterday&#8217;s Game 2 score reminded you of another sport, it should be pointed out that the last Haverford-Muhlenberg softball game outscored the last Haverford-Muhlenberg football game, a 28-0 Mule win in 1971 shortly before the Fords discontinued the sport.</p>

			<p>A pair of Muhlenberg men’s lacrosse players recently traded in their sticks and pads for pencils and sketchbooks.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/salaskoart21.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1018" title="salaskoart2" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/salaskoart21.jpg" alt="" width="396" height="396" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/salaskoart21.jpg 396w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/salaskoart21-150x150.jpg 150w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/salaskoart21-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 396px) 100vw, 396px" /></a>Seniors Jay Salasko and Alex Ardolino are taking the class Drawing from Nature this semester, and some of their work is currently on display in the Galleria Lobby at the Baker Center for the Arts.</p>
<p>The class encourages students to seek inspiration from the natural world, be it birds, fish or animals &#8211; or even their bones. For a recent project, they were given various skulls and skeletons from the science department replicate. Both Salasko and Ardolino took a shot at drawing a pig skull. Salasko also tried his hand at sketching pig foot bones.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/salaskoart.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1011" title="salaskoart" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/salaskoart.jpg" alt="" width="269" height="720" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/salaskoart.jpg 269w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/salaskoart-112x300.jpg 112w" sizes="(max-width: 269px) 100vw, 269px" /></a>And while the subjects may seem rather macabre, Salasko said they were interesting and that he enjoyed the challenge of trying to convey the depth and feel of the objects.</p>
<p>“There are a lot of curves and shadows that can be tough to draw, especially on the skull,” he said. “It was cool to hold the two next to each other when I was done.”</p>
<p>While neither of them consider themselves artists, they said they’ve always been interested in drawing and that it gives them a chance to be creative.</p>
<p>A psychology major, Salasko has been drawing and doodling since he was a kid. But he never had any formal training until he took Drawing I in the spring of his sophomore year. That experience piqued his interest, so he took Painting I this past summer. And when he needed credits this spring to fulfill his graduation requirements, he took a look at the available art classes.</p>
<p>Ardolino, who is majoring in business administration, got his work hanging on the gallery wall in much the same fashion. He took Drawing I this past fall, and enjoyed it so much that he decided to keep with it this semester. Of course it didn’t hurt that one of his teammates was also in the class.</p>
<p>Now that they’ve gotten their works on display, Salasko and Ardolino hope to draw a few more masterpieces on the field.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/ardolinoart.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1014" title="ardolinoart" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/ardolinoart.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="396" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/ardolinoart.jpg 400w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/ardolinoart-150x150.jpg 150w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/ardolinoart-300x297.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/ardolinoart-303x300.jpg 303w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></a>And when they’re sitting at their desks a few years from now working on a project or doing some research, they just might start to doodle. And pretty soon that doodle could turn into a sketch, which just might bring back some memories of their time taking Drawing from Nature</p>
<p>“It’s a fun class, and I’ve learned a lot,” Ardolino said. “I never thought I’d be taking many art classes, but I really enjoy it. And I definitely think I&#8217;ll keep drawing.”</p>

<p>Kline was almost impossible to get out in a 4-2 CC week for the Mules, reaching base in 19 of 25 plate appearances and hitting .684 with 10 runs scored and 12 RBI. She had two doubles, a triple and her fifth home run of the season for a slugging percentage of 1.053 and an OPS of 1.813. Kline also broke the school record for longest hitting streak &#8211; 19 games.</p>

<p>Ferlan played &#8220;stopper,&#8221; halting the Mules&#8217; two-game skid with an impressive performance in the second game of the McDaniel doubleheader. He pitched into the ninth inning, scattering nine hits and striking out five in Muhlenberg&#8217;s 4-2 win. Ferlan is the first Mule hurler to win his first four decisions in a season since 1988.</p>

			<p><em>As college basketball prepares for the last few games of the 2011-12 season, here are some final thoughts from the two seniors in the Muhlenberg men&#8217;s basketball program, taken from their Senior Day profiles.</em></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/01/liddichs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-662" title="Spencer Liddic" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/01/liddichs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Spencer Liddic</strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s your secret to grabbing so many rebounds? </strong>My real secret to grabbing so many rebounds is simply to miss a layup and grab the offensive rebound. <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>How have you changed as a player during your career? </strong>I have continually tried to extend my game away from strictly layups and become a better outside shooter. I believe I have also become a better leader, and I strive to make everyone on our young team better every day. Lastly, as coach can attest, I have become a pretty tenacious defender. I regularly match up against our opponent’s fifth-best scorer.</p>
<p><strong>What did it mean to you to be just the third first-team Academic All-American in school history? </strong></p>
<p>It is an enormous honor to represent Muhlenberg College both academically and athletically at the national level. It is also a tremendous tribute to my teammates, coaches and professors; I would never have been able to achieve such an award without their help. <em></em></p>
<p><strong>What’s the most memorable moment from your Mule career? </strong>Besides all the friendships that I have made during my four years at Muhlenberg, my most memorable moments are definitely the two home wins over nationally ranked Franklin &amp; Marshall teams. Those are two wins that I will remember for the rest of my life. <em></em></p>
<p><strong>Your great-grandmother was Gertrude Hawk of candy fame. How much chocolate did you eat growing up? </strong>Let’s just say I have had my fair share of Smidgens over the years.<em></em></p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans? </strong>I have already accepted a job with JPMorgan Chase in Newark, Delaware. I also hope to one day open my own business.<em></em></p>
<p><strong>What has Max Saidman meant to the team as a student assistant? </strong>Max brings a lot of basketball knowledge to the program. He does an immense amount of behind-the-scenes work and has poured his heart and soul into the program over the past four years. Max recently scouted and successfully put together a winning game plan against the No. 8 team in the country, F&amp;M. The program will greatly miss Max when he graduates in May.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/saidmanhs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-993" title="Max Saidman" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/saidmanhs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Max Saidman</strong></p>
<p><strong>What made you decide to become a student assistant?</strong><em> </em>Coach Madeira told me he didn’t need any more sub-six-foot slow guys and decided to cut me. So I stayed around pretty much for the free gear.  <em></em></p>
<p><strong>What do your duties entail?</strong><em> </em><strong>What do you like doing best?</strong> My duties entail everything that Coach Finch doesn’t want to do. The thing I like to do the best is set the “Swag Standard” for the squad. <em></em></p>
<p><strong>What’s the most memorable basketball moment from your time at Muhlenberg?</strong><em> </em>When we toured Ireland the summer before my sophomore year. This year, it was definitely beating F&amp;M at home. That game and atmosphere were awesome. <em></em></p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans?</strong><em> </em>Continue to work with a team or company that is basketball related. I’m a free agent, and I’m looking for the first place to step up with a six-figure signing bonus.<em></em></p>
<p><strong>What’s it been like spending four years with Spencer Liddic?</strong><em> </em>Spencer this, Spencer that. All-America this, All-America that. 4.0 GPA this, 4.0 GPA that. Spencer, Spencer, Spencer &#8230; That’s all we ever hear!! But actually, believe it or not, Spencer is even better than all the hype. He never lets it get to his head and is always putting the team first. He’s a great player, but an even better guy off the court.<em></em></p>
