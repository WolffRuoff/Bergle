								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;d be lying if I said I don&#8217;t care about how many likes my Instagram posts get. If I don&#8217;t get as many likes as I expected for a post, a part of me feels disappointed. There&#8217;s something about getting a lot of likes that is so fulfilling and satisfying. When I first got an Instagram, I was always jealous of people who got more likes than me. I was so desperate at one point, that I used #likesforlikes to get strangers to like my posts. Why must we be in this preconceived notion thatÂ we are defined by numbers?</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not against social sharing, I&#8217;m against the current status of social media.&#8221; -Essena O&#8217;Neill, a 19-year-old from Australia (BuzzFeedBlue 2015). From a glimpse at her Instagram, O&#8217;Neill looks like she has it all. Not only is she gorgeous and has a small figure, but she has over half a million followers on Instagram and gets thousands of likes. Who wouldn&#8217;t want to be like that? Well it turns out that her &#8220;perfect&#8221; life isn&#8217;t as perfect as it seems. Because she got so Instagram-famous, O&#8217;Neill felt this pressure to continue posting picture-perfect posts of herself. She became miserable because &#8220;she became addicted to the approval of her appearance&#8221;, and the only thing that made her feel better was getting more likes and followers (BuzzFeedBlue 2015). As a result, O&#8217;Neill changed the captions of her pictures to expose how these &#8220;candid&#8221; pictures were staged so that she would look her absolute best.</p>
<p>I feel that even though we live in an era of technological advancements, we should all take a step back and look at what is truly important. Family, friends, health, equality&#8230;values in life that can&#8217;t be defined by numbers. It is up to us social media users to get out of this habit of caring about likes and start caring about things that are authentic.</p>
