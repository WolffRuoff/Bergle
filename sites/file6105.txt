								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today, one event in particular stuck out to me, showing me how close a group of my classmates have become.</p>
<p>I’m taking this rather unusual First Year Seminar called <em>Finding Your Muse</em>. (Check out my previous post for more details.) Each Monday, two students lead the entire class period. I co-led my “Monday Muse” session several weeks ago. In consultation with the professor, you plan out the class period considering where the ensemble is now, where they need to go, and how they can get there.</p>
<p>Today, the theme was Vulnerability. The two students leading the session had us each prepare a story to share about a meaningful experience that has affected our life in a profound way. What was so fantastic about this was that, going around the circle and telling our stories, everyone completely trusted each other. Some people shared stories that they never had before. Some people cried. Some people talked about hardships that they’re still struggling with today. I won’t share details, but let’s just say it was deeply moving.</p>
<p>We also had a discussion about each individual student, examining how others see them versus why and who they actually are.</p>
<p>After just an hour-long discussion, the feeling of unsurpassed safety was unanimous. We hugged, wiped our tears, and some parted ways while others continued bonding over lunch.</p>
<p>In the everyday hustle and bustle of college students’ lives, it’s easy to disregard the larger, sometimes painful truths that exist in our histories. It was such a remarkable blessing to have this experience today. It was so refreshing and enlightening to have everyone shed their defenses and just talk about big, complex things that have made them who they are.</p>
<p>We’re not just a class anymore. We’re becoming a family.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey everyone! My name is Emma and I’m a freshman double majoring in Theatre with a concentration in Directing, and Business with a concentration in Arts Administration. I have absolutely adored my Muhlenberg experience so far, and wouldn’t change it for the world. This semester I’m taking five classes:</p>
<p><strong>Principles of Microeconomics</strong>, taught by one of my favorite professors, Dr. Laposata, is the first Econ I’ve ever taken. We have a quiz every other class, which I really appreciate because it (hopefully) ensures that everyone stays on top of the material we’re covering.</p>
<p><strong>Principles of Fitness &amp; Wellness</strong><span style="color: #333333; font-style: normal; line-height: 24px;"> is a General Academic Requirement (GAR) that all students typically take during their freshman year. We’ve just completed the Wellness module of the course, which featured many guest speakers from areas of the college including IT, Res Life and the Career Center. Next up is the Fitness module, led by soccer Coach Topping.</span></p>
<p><strong>Voice and Speech for the Actor</strong> is probably both my favorite and most dreaded course I’ve yet to take at Berg. Through three-hour experiential workshops each week, we’ve so far explored the production of sound, tension and stress, phonetics and personal histories, all the while tackling my ironic fear of speaking in front of a group. The teacher, Troy Dwyer, is perhaps the most enlightened and motivating professor at Muhlenberg, and this class has allowed me more personal growth than I’d ever have anticipated.</p>
<p><strong>Design for the Theatre</strong> with Tim Averill is a requirement for my Directing concentration and I’m enjoying it very much. It’s definitely more of a discussion and experiential learning class than my other courses. We’ve recently been learning about different elements of visual and spatial design through our in-class analysis of the play <em>Peer Gynt</em> by Henrik Ibsen.</p>
<p><strong>Finding Your Muse</strong> with Dr. Michael London is my first year seminar (FYS), and is both a writing intensive and performance ensemble course. Through discussions, papers, in-class free writes, readings, artistic collaborations, etc., we are spending the semester exploring what it means to be creative and developing a cumulative large-scale performance piece. As part of the curriculum, two weeks ago I was challenged to lead an entire class period with one other classmate. It was an absolutely fantastic experience.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi everyone! I&#8217;m Caroline and I&#8217;m a sophomore here at Muhlenberg. I&#8217;m pursuing a major in Spanish along with two minors in sociology and studio art. While my schedule is sometimes hectic, it&#8217;s nice that I&#8217;m able to study three incredibly different fields during my time at school. That&#8217;s one of the benefits of a liberal arts education-students at Muhlenberg are able to combine many of their interests, including subjects that might not normally seem like they fit together.</p>
<p>This semester, I&#8217;m taking four awesome classes, one in each major and minor I&#8217;m pursuing and one General Academic Requirement. I start off my week with Postcolonial Realities in Spanish American Literature, which is an advanced literature class taught entirely in Spanish. We&#8217;re reading lots of awesome texts, and exploring poets and writers who I&#8217;ve never had the chance to delve into as much before taking this class. After that, I move on to Inequality and Power, a sociology course investigating the many aspects of the American criminal justice system.  I love that this class is discussion based, and I often come out of it continuing to talk with my peers as we walk to our next classes.</p>
<p>Later in the week, I head to the Center for the Arts for Painting II, a continuation of a class I took last spring. This is one of my favorite parts of the week because I get to take a break from the stress of my more academic classes and just enjoy the studio time. I&#8217;m currently working on a series of small paintings which will eventually be turned into a collage and later on a large-scale painting. (more on this later!)</p>
<p>My last class is Topics in Environmental Science, which fulfills my science requirement for graduation. I&#8217;m lucky that even though science is not my favorite subject, I have a great teacher who explains all the material in a way that is engaging and accessible to all students. So far, I&#8217;ve been enjoying the class more than I thought I would, and I like knowing that if I ever needed extra help, both my professor and the Academic Resource Center would be able to provide me with it.</p>
<p>I am enjoying having no Friday classes this semester, which allows me to spend time in the library and get a head start on my homework before the weekend begins. Although the weekend is a break from the daily class schedule, I still have just as much going on (sometimes more!) as I do during the weekdays. That&#8217;s a whole new blog post!</p>
<p>Until next time,<br />
Caroline</p>
