					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Sorry to hear so many of  you had to experience some unpleasantness during your trip. Hope you managed to make some good memories anyway, had time to bond, practice in the sunshine and are ready for a great season. Can&#039;t wait to see you all on the 14th.  Bellini&#039;s mom&lt;/p&gt;
