					<description><![CDATA[Great blog post title!  Nice one...This is a great example of both the power and limitations of the blockbuster format, Group 3.  This is an interesting case in which a production powerhouse, Disney, had made a strategic move to buy a production firm specializing in animation (ImageMovers) - thereby consolidating some producer-role power.  It looks like that gamble did not pay off, however, and Disney is now cutting its losses by selling or divesting itself of that firm.  How might we think about this move, and the low opening weekend box office revenues, in terms of power roles?  I like your selection of articles here, but more is needed to contextualize what this means for the industry.  Take a look back at my comments on the midterm blog sheet for some guidance here.  Also, please provide a direct hyperlink to the article you used as well.]]></description>
