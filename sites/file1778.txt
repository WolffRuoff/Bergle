					<p>We understand that student networking and endorsement opens <strong><span style="color: #9d2235">&#8220;RED&#8221;</span></strong> doors to valuable student internship opportunities on campus.  Read on to learn about student internship and practicum experiences recommended by our Media and Communication majors.</p>

<p><em><strong>Guilia Santoro&#8211; Public Relations: </strong></em>As an intern in the Public Relations office I was given the opportunity to get hands on experience with creating content for social media, filming talks on campus, and photographing students and faculty. I was exposed to the public relations industry through the lens of higher education. It also just gave me the experience of having an internship in a very rich and educating environment. I had filming and photo equipment available to me and was able learn in real time. My knowledge and experience with shooting on a DSLR grew exponentially. This internship taught me how to be flexible and ambitious with taking on projects. I was given the opportunity to take on a project, which involved taking and editing photos of Emerging Leaders on campus. I then created posters with the images I took. This internship gave me the confidence to take on projects solo and adapt to changing environments.</p>
<p><strong><em>Melissa Bodnar- Alumni Relations, Social Media: </em></strong>As the Social Media Assistant for Alumni Relations, I had the opportunity to develop my own skills in a dynamic and emerging field.  Through this internship experience, I learned how to use social media to strengthen the connection between our vast alumni network and the Muhlenberg College community.  Over the course of the semester, my confidence in my own creativity grew, as I was given the freedom to create content and social media campaigns that I was passionate about.  Had I not graduated, I would have already submitted my application to continue. Without a doubt in my mind, I can say that this internship experience has been one of the most enjoyable and valuable of my college career.</p>

<p><em><strong>Natalie Coy- Johnstown Magazine</strong><strong>: </strong></em> This summer, I participated in a practicum internship as an editorial intern for Johnstown Magazine. Through this program, I was able to receive credit for my internship as my CUE course that is required for all seniors at Muhlenberg. This being said, I never would&#8217;ve imagined the amount of real-life educational experience I would be able to gain in just one summer on top of the credential benefit. As an editorial intern, I got to experience first-hand what it is truly like to work in the magazine industry, a career I have always dreamed of. Besides copy-editing stories and fact-checking pieces, I actually got the opportunity to write several articles for the magazine which were published in a few of the monthly issues. As a writer, I was given the chance to investigate leads, interview subjects, schedule photo shoots, and write pieces with my very own journalistic touch, which I can now use as published clips when applying to future jobs in the journalism field. While my long-term goal is to work for a well-known lifestyle magazine, my experience at a smaller publication was overwhelmingly positive due to the amount of freedom, responsibility, and opportunity I was given to work as if I were a true editorial employee. As an intern, I frequently found myself having &#8220;aha&#8221; moments, in which hands-on experiences or dilemmas reminded me of concepts discussed in the Muhlenberg classroom. All-in-all, I think that this is the greatest benefit of the internship experience  ̶  I have been able to better solidify my knowledge and understanding of the media field by applying practice to concept. My advice for those considering internships is to dive in! No matter the size of the company, your experience level, or how sure you are about your future plans, an internship is your chance to explore and discover just as much about yourself as a worker as the field that you are interested in.</p>
<p><em><strong>Catt Minster-</strong> <strong>SWB&amp;R:</strong></em><strong> </strong>Though I could tell from the office&#8217;s positive energy and my supervisor&#8217;s lively sense of humor that I was going to have a ton of fun, I underestimated how much I would grow from my internship experience. I knew a little bit about public relations from previous internships and coursework, SWB&amp;R taught me so much about working with clients, writing marketing content, and business development.  Though the internship was challenging, my supervisors helped me feel a sense of success.  They gave me work at a nice, even pace, and I never felt overwhelmed or under appreciated.  As a senior I&#8217;ve had many fears about graduating; my supervisors taught me so much that I feel well-prepared for a job in the &#8220;real world.&#8221;  After having such a positive experience at SWB&amp;R, working in an office does not seem so intimidating anymore.  If my job experience is anything like SWB&amp;R, I know I&#8217;ll love every minute and I&#8217;m excited to bring stronger writing, editing, business, advertising, marketing, and other skills with me.  Gaining a deeper knowledge of the industry will serve me well no matter where I end up working.</p>
<p><em><strong>Max Suitovsky- Menu Genie: </strong></em>At Menu Genie, every day is different, and an adventure in its own right. If you are looking to work in an innovative and dynamic working environment, then Menu Genie is the place to be. Menu Genie is an online restaurant search and order portal where users can browse menus and place takeout and delivery orders from their favorite local restaurants.

Menu Genie gives you the opportunity to construct your own innovative and dynamic marketing designs and apply them to real-world settings. It is up to you to bring a fresh set of eyes and a new perspective to the table. If you are a college student looking to gain skills in marketing, social media, and technology, then look no farther than Menu Genie. You get the opportunity to interact with various customers, restaurants, and designers throughout the Lehigh Valley. You will have the opportunity to promote Menu Genie through your own innovative and dynamic marketing channels. If you are a creative thinker and willing to learn, then Menu Genie is the place for you.</p>
<p><strong><em>Hanna Work- Connasseur Media:</em></strong><em> </em> There are many different facets to radio that I didn’t know about while coming into this internship.  There are the sales, advertising, promotions, and accounting departments, and the actual DJs.  Day by day, everyone is working really hard to get the radio stations more acknowledged.  The sales department deals with getting companies to buy air time on the radio stations so our company can make money and so the other company can be advertised for.  The advertising department works closely with the promotions department by sending part-time workers to various sites for remote locations.  There have been times where people sat outside the Amazon warehouse with a DJ playing music and giving away prizes so Connoisseur Media’s station can be more known.  The DJs are obviously the ones playing the music on the stations.  Being a DJ is extremely difficult and there is a lot that goes into it.  I worked closely with the promotions assistants and set up their agendas for them while the go on-site.</p>
<p><em><strong>Hayley Galembo- Sparks Creatives</strong><strong>:  </strong></em>Interning at Spark Creatives has taught me a great amount about working at a full-service marketing, public relations and advertising agency in the Lehigh Valley. I worked directly under the supervision of the PR manager and learned how an agency handles multiple clients and crafts different strategies for each one. Some of the clients Spark works with include: Lehigh Valley Health Network, St. Luke’s Physical Therapy, Melt, Air Products, PPL and more. So what is really interesting about this internship is that by working with so many clients, you can really have an overview of a bunch of different businesses and the culture behind them. I gained a range of experience regarding what it takes to write press releases, feature stories, pitches, conduct competitive analysis and manage client relationships. Through this experience, I really was able to improve my communication and writing skills and became a more confident student. I had a lot of fun interning here and it certainly is an energetic environment. The employees love to have fun and while they work hard, they always make sure to include time to goof off or discuss football (they loved football!). I would highly recommend this internship for a student who wants to test out the waters of PR and someone who is a strong writer and can work individually and independently on a variety of products.</p>
<p><strong><em>Kate Burdick- Civic Theatre:</em> </strong> Everyday in the office at The Civic Theatre of Allentown brought something new, exciting, and challenging.  There was always a new project or task to complete and being at a non-profit organization made work a group effort. Even though I had my individual responsibilities as Development Intern, it was a necessity that everyone in the office worked together, such as writing grants, transitioning a database with new software, compiling a Playbill, and day to day duties such as writing press releases, updating the website and social media pages, writing letters to sponsors and members, marketing upcoming productions, and helping with ticket sales.  I was able to strengthen my skills in many different areas because I was expected and able to partake in multiple facets of the theatre.</p>
<p><em><strong>Kira Colburn- Sue Williams &amp; Associates LLC: </strong></em>I had an internship with Sue Williams at her self-established company Sue Williams &amp; Associates LLC located down the street from Muhlenberg. I appreciated getting first hand professional experience in public relations and communications.  The main project I worked on was the Muhlenberg College Annual Report where I got to actively contribute to the process. I conducted online research about certain topics pertaining to Muhlenberg then drafted a paragraph or more based around what information I found. To make sure all facts were accurate, all research was recorded and referenced if needed. I also drafted many contact lists for the Parkland Community Library, which has made me proficient in Excel.  This opportunity has helped improve my writing skills and learn about the public relations world, important aspects to have as a pre-professional.</p>
<p><em><strong>Stephanie Huber- ArtsQuest</strong></em>: My internship with ArtsQuest was a one of a kind great experience. I did the Arts and Administration/ Education internship so I would get experience in both internships. They wanted to have their Visual Design intern get a hands-on experience of everything the Banana Factory (ArtsQuest’s art branch) had to offer. My boss would hand me assignments with not much to go off of to encourage me to be resourceful and take initiative; yet she was there for me if I had any questions or wanted more direction.  While I site I constructed publicity, helped ensemble gallery installations, and worked directly with artists in residence.  Overall, the experience was a great way to combine my Art and Media &amp; Communication majors. While I had the opportunity to interact with different mediums hands-on, I also got to flex my mind with varying types of writings such as press releases that I had learned from my Media and Communication classes.</p>
<p><em><strong>Katherine Peikes – WDIY 88.1</strong></em>: My experience at 88.1 WDIY was highly beneficial in furthering my interest in a future radio career. The stations’ call letters, “DIY”, stand for “definitely it’s you”, or, “do it yourself”, and as per its name, teaches one to be independent while they do their job at the station. By the third week of my production internship, I not only felt like I knew what I was doing, but also revised the instructions for my internship tasks (digital file uploading and archiving radio shows/segments) so that future interns would know how to do it. In addition to learning a lot about making cleaner, quicker edits to radio pieces, I was given the opportunity to write, record and edit my own news feature piece for the station. I spent two months enhancing my interviewing and conversational skills to question various people around campus on how they felt about their privacy on technology being violated (after the Edward Snowden story became dominant in our news).  I am grateful for the experience I had at WDIY, and because of it, I plan to be more involved in campus radio, and radio when I am abroad.</p>
<p><em><strong>Emily Szulman- Men’s Health</strong></em>: Interning at Men’s Health magazine has taught me a considerable amount about the communications field, specifically the marketing and advertising aspect. I gained a wide range of experience regarding what it takes to publish a magazine, how to create an effective and efficient PowerPoint presentation, and how to stand out from competitors, to list a few. Working with a range of employees has also improved my communication skills, which I will be using for the rest of my life. Some of these skills include a strong work ethic, management and interpersonal skills, computer and technical skills, and organizational skills. Working with Word, Excel, Outlook, and Compass (the main database) have all given me certain skills that will help me thrive at my next job.  Through this experience, I have become a more creative and self-confident person, which will significantly benefit me in the future. I gained valuable experience in a wonderful environment and I would highly recommend this internship for Media and Communication majors.</p>
<p><em><strong>Jordan Gruber- Swain School</strong></em>: I used to believe that finding my niche in the professional world would never happen. What I took away from my experience at The Swain School this semester was truly more than just on the job skills. It gave me confidence in what I chose to do in college and where to head in life. I learned that even if you go through an internship that does not fit you, you should not chalk it up as wasted time. The time you spend at any job or internship will always teach you something more about what you want to end up doing as a career.</p>

<p><em><strong>Kaitlin Mitchell- Saturday Night Live:</strong></em> Interning in New York City as a Writers’ Research Intern at<em> Saturday Night Live</em> has been a rewarding and amazing opportunity. As a child, I only dreamt of interning at a television show such as this one. As a Writers’ Research Intern, I am responsible for assisting writers, producers, and the cast with anything that they might need to facilitate the production of the show. This includes both running errands and performing research for particular show segments. Working at SNL is exciting because you never know what kind of tasks you are going to be asked to do. It is an incredible networking opportunity, as I have found myself building relationships with people in the industry who can help me in the future. I feel lucky to be observing the staff at this Emmy award winning show. Their insight truly is invaluable and it has given me the confidence that I need to know that I can one day produce successful content of my own. The Media and Communication Department at Muhlenberg prepared me well for this internship experience, as they provided me with a plethora of theory based knowledge and information that helps me understand how SNL comes together as a show on a weekly basis. This knowledge has also challenged me to consider the production aspects of SNL from the standpoint of a media student. I could not have asked for a better internship to round out my senior year, and I know that between my experience at SNL and my education through the Media and Communication Department, I can find success when I venture into the real world full time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong>Alexa McKeon- Caro Marketing</strong></em>:  Caro Marketing is an extremely small fashion public relations firm located on both the east and west coasts. Interning at Caro Marketing allows you to get as much experience as possible since there are only a few people working in their New York office.  They rely heavily on their interns and give them a lot of responsibility.  Some of the possible tasks that an intern has to do in the office are to send out and check in samples, take inventory of the samples, researching fashion blogs, writing editorial pitches, maintaining the showroom, etc.  This internship is very hands on and requires strong people skills, thinking on your feet, writing skills, knowledge in fashion, and definitely passion for the business.  You will not succeed in this internship if you are lacking any of these qualities.  The people that work at Caro Marketing want the interns to succeed and push them to the edge knowing their abilities and skills.  From day one, you will be given a large amount of tasks, which may seem overwhelming at first, but you will be thankful in the end for how much you learn.  I got to do things that actually helped the business and got involved as much as I could.  Caro Marketing is definitely a great company to intern for if you are interested in public relations.  I was very lucky to have such a great experience and felt that I learned from the best.</p>
<p><em><strong>Madison White – Wrightstown Health and Fitness</strong></em>: My internship at Wrightstown Health and Fitness was a meaningful learning experience for me. It not only informed me of what it takes to be part of an actual media and communications job but also provided me with valuable insight and a hands-on learning experience.  When my internship started I was naturally nervous but as each day went on I felt more comfortable with what I could do. I learned a lot about media and communication and gained good experience with real hands-on experience. Some of my jobs included updating and posting on social media websites, creating signs, making website headers, formatting of the website, communicating with others for website changes, hosting an event for Toys For Tots, and more. I believe my communication skills, graphic skills, and overall knowledge for the field increased during my time at Wrightstown Health and Fitness. Having a hands on experience is much different than just learning the subject matter as I learned more responsibility, how to work for someone, and really got to use my creative side. As I am working toward a career in Media and Communications this internship was a very valuable experience to me as I finally got hands on experience. It not only allowed me to improve my media and communication skills, but confirmed my decision of Media and Communication as my major and future career.</p>
<p><em><strong>Jacob Karpen- HBO</strong></em>: I began my internship at HBO, like many other students, unsure of what was going to happen, and wanting to succeed.  As the other employees on my Consumer Marketing team began to open up to me, I began to open up to them.  This really aided in the quality of my work.  I shadowed my team to meetings, listened in on their phone calls, and was copied on all of their emails.  Whenever I needed any help, I learned to ask.  All of the members on my team were willing to help all the time.  As I look back on my internship, I am so grateful to have met such nice, hardworking people.  For the most part, at HBO, you will not find an employee unhappy.  This is a testament to the laid back, yet serious culture at HBO.  If I had to choose one lesson that I learned this summer, that will stick with me for the rest of my life, it is that hard work pays off.  If you are not willing to put in the effort, you will not see results.  Every single employee at HBO had to work hard to get to where they are, and the quality of their work proves this.</p>
<p><em><strong>Amanda Schlussel- EVINS</strong></em>: My experience as an intern at EVINS was an exciting and rewarding one. This internship gave me the opportunity to put my hard work and dedication in school to good use. The most important thing about getting a liberal arts education is the ability to take what you have learned and make real life experiences out of them. This is exactly what my internship this summer has afforded me.  On the first day of my internship we were asked to write down two long-term goals that we had for the internship. Both of my goals came true and that is what I call a real life experience. For instance, the first goal that I wrote and completed was to learn how to successfully execute and plan a Public Relations program/initiative. With the extensive work that I completed for a Tales of the Cocktail event I was successfully able to achieve this goal.   My team was able to go to New Orleans for the event, which was rewarding after days of research and planning for it.</p>
<p><em><strong>Alexandra Rothenberg- Agentry PR</strong></em>: I really enjoyed my experience interning at Agentry PR this summer. I was assigned to work with one of the account managers and was responsible for our newest client, Christian Siriano. I was very excited about having my own client.  I researched blogs that would be appropriate for the client to advertise on, or to have a giveaway to help promote his new collection. I also helped with pulls, which is when a stylist would send us an email detailing a shoot for a magazine, or a celebrity they would be dressing, and I would pick out clothing and accessories to send them that I thought would be appropriate. I would also help with the company’s expenses each month, and would constantly update our client list. For the fourth of July I got to research fashion blogs from last summer to see what types of clothing and accessories were blogged about for the holiday, and then I went through our clients and picked out which items I thought we should include in our send out for the holiday. I attended company and client meetings, in addition to designer parties, meeting clients and industry representatives who could be potential contacts for the future. I was invited back for fashion week in September to help out with our client Christian Siriano’s fashion show that seven hundred people will be attending! Overall this was a great experience for me, and really heightened my excitement for public relations. I enjoyed working at a small company because I was able to have many more hands on experiences, and work closely with everyone in the company.</p>
<p><em><strong>Jenny Karp- TV NBC40:</strong></em> This summer’s internship at TV NBC40 in Linwood, New Jersey, was a fantastic experience for my junior year. There were great advantages of being at a local TV station in that it really helped me to understand the important role of the TV station to the local community.  It was exciting to witness the excitement families had for potentially watching their family members on air. This was such a great experience not only for my future, but also mainly for myself! I understood the business aspect, behind the scenes, and of course the importance for when you are on camera.</p>
<p><em><strong>Lindsay Shedlin- The Wendy Williams Show</strong></em>: I could not have asked for a better summer internship experience. Going in, I thought I was interested in television but I had never had any experience actually working in the field.  Now, I am extremely interested in pursuing a career in the television business. My internship at The Wendy Williams Show was not the typical internship where interns are either sitting around all day doing nothing, or running out all day doing errands for people. From the very beginning, my supervisors had me doing actual work such as research and working with the audience. I got to spend time with various producers and see what their day-to-day work involved and I was constantly on the studio floor working behind the scenes. Another aspect of my internship that made it as memorable as it was, was the staff I was working for. The staff was extremely welcoming and kind to me and I could go to them with any questions I had. Working with such nice, engaging people really made an extreme impact on my experience at the show. I am so lucky to have met these amazing, dedicated people who I will definitely be able to reach out to for guidance in the future. Working at The Wendy Williams Show was truly a life-changing experience that I will never forget.</p>
<p><em><strong>Erica Kornbluh- Kleinfeld Name Change</strong></em>: What will I do with my media and communications degree once I graduate in 2015?  Like many media and communication majors, I began asking myself this question after I handed in my signed declaration paper.  I knew that in addition to taking the nine required courses I needed to gain hands-on experience in the field.  The best way for me to begin doing this would be by getting a summer internship.  From November until March I applied to approximately 15 listings that I mostly found online and around April I landed an internship at Kleinfeld, a Manhattan based bridal store that is featured on the TLC show, Say Yes To The Dress.  Yet this would not be my reality television debut.  Instead, I would be interning for Kleinfeld Name Change, a startup company that recently partnered with Kleinfeld. Kleinfeld Name Change is a service that allows brides to change their maiden name to their married name without the time commitment or hassle.  A large part of a startup company’s success is how well they market and promote their product.  My biggest task was promoting Kleinfeld Name Change to the brides at Kleinfeld. While this internship did not teach me exactly what I want to do with my life after college, it gave me a phenomenal taste of what it takes to be an intern and eventually a full time employee. This summer certainly allowed me to get one foot in the door and a taste of what life will be like post-graduation.  I hope that next summer I will find another internship that allows me to come even closer to picking a career path.</p>
<p><em><strong>Emily Szulman- Hearst’s Seventeen Magazine</strong></em>:  Interning at Seventeen magazine has taught me a lot about the communications field. I learned how important it is to research top competitors in order to find ways to stand out, and what your target audience wants to read about. Additionally, I learned how to effectively communicate via email and on the phone to subscribers, coworkers and clients, and have improved my researching and communication skills. Working in a fast-paced environment has also taught me how important it is to stay on top of your assignments and to have strong organizational and technical skills. I have enhanced my computer skills by using NICA (online database), Word, Excel, and a variety of social outlets including Pinterest, Instagram, Twitter and Facebook. Moreover, I have improved my artistic skills by having the opportunity to create hashtags and workout titles for the magazine and have demonstrated time management and a good work ethic. This internship has offered me many valuable lessons, which I will carry throughout my life, and I would certainly recommend this internship for Media and Communication majors.</p>
<p><em><strong>Kristen Romney- Sharp Entertainment</strong></em>: In the summer, 2013, I interned at Sharp Entertainment, which is a reality-television production company in New York City, founded by Matt Sharp about a decade ago. Essentially, the company produces shows for larger companies (e.g. Animal Planet, TLC, and the Discovery Channel.) It was an invaluable experience working in a real, fast-paced New York television company.  Specifically,</p>
<p>I did pre- and post-production administrative tasks, shadowed editors, and got to watch a shoot. I found it so interesting how much office work goes into television production.  In particular, I really enjoyed shadowing people who do editing, as I’ve had this interest since high school.  One day this summer, I was sent on location.  All in all, I would say this has been a rewarding experience.</p>
<p><em><strong>Annie La Rocca- Casablanca Records:</strong></em> I had so much fun at my internship this summer.  It was amazing working with the general manager and being around the executives, artists, and showcases that inhabit this space.  Showcases are when artists, either established or aspiring, come in and perform a couple songs in front of the executives.  This internship was also really fun for me personally because Casablanca is an electronic dance music label, which is a type of music that I love! This made me really passionate about my work and it made finding new artists fun. The work involved in my internship consisted of mostly working on various reports for Brett and A&amp;R, which was looking for artists to potentially sign.  As this was my second internship with Universal Music Group, I feel as though I’ve become a familiar face around that office and established strong working relationships with the people that I’ve met.</p>
