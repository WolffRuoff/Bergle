								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I first came to Muhlenberg as a freshman I was hesitant about the college for a lot of reasons. Luckily, orientation demonstrated that I had come to a really great place. Especially seeing the Sedehi Diversity Project for the first time.</p>
<p>Myself, along with one hundred or so freshmen filed into the performance space in our orientation groups, and I was completely unsure of what to expect. Orientation puts you through the wringer &#8211; you&#8217;re busy constantly and completely over stimulated by all the new people you&#8217;re meeting and new experiences you&#8217;re having. That coupled by the hurricane and everyone was a little frazzled. Once we were all seated, the director of the project stood up and introduced the play &#8211; I don&#8217;t even remember what she said &#8211; and then it began.</p>
<p>Students just started talking. And saying things I&#8217;d never heard anyone say before.</p>
<p>The diversity project talks about a lot of topics. Generally, we cover discussions of race, class, gender, sexual orientation, religion, ability (in terms of physical disabilities, learning disabilities, and mental health), body image, and Muhlenberg’s relationship to Allentown.</p>
<p>I honestly did not know people were allowed to talk about these issues. I’d been taught all my life that it was rude to talk about race or class or religion or ability, and why bother talking about sexual orientation or gender – non-normativity in these areas doesn’t exist. And suddenly my peers were all around me being blatantly honest about how they felt.</p>
<p>I realized I fit somewhere. That things I’d been experiencing in my life were real. And that conversations about diversity aren’t rude, they are 100% necessary. All of the time. For every.</p>
<p>I cried during my first viewing of the Sedehi Diversity Project. Four separate times. I’d never thought about ways in which core aspects of my identity had an impact on positive and negative experiences of life. I’d always thought it was just my life and those experiences happened detached from any sense of identity. Just to me. But as it turns out, those positive and negative life experiences are attached to aspects of identity that inform how you interact with everything and everyone!</p>
<p>After the Diversity Project, orientation groups have lengthy discussions about what they’ve seen and their feelings regarding diversity. My orientation group, together, grappled with the loss of the naïve perspective our high schools had taught us. We were shocked by the play and shocked by each other. That day 4 of us came out to each other (be it in official discussion or in conversation amongst ourselves). I’d never come out to any one before and here I was coming out to whole groups of people! Because SDP told me I could!</p>
<p>I think the Sedehi Diversity Project, more than anything else, connects people. It facilitates conversations with people who are different. It facilitates conversation with people who are the same (but didn’t know they were the same at all).  And it starts the most important conversation – a conversation about power and access and how we all interact with each other and the world</p>
