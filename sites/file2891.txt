								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bond, Paul. (2011, April 27). &#8216;Atlas Shrugged&#8217; producer promises two sequels despite terrible reviews, poor box office. <em>The Hollywood Reporter</em>. Retrieved from <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/atlas-shrugged-producer-promises-two-182714">http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/atlas-shrugged-producer-promises-two-182714</a></p>

The film, based on Ayn Rand&#8217;s long controversial 1957 novel of the same name, opened on April 15. This is probably news to many of this blog&#8217;s readers, and it&#8217;s news to us as well. In writing the novel &#8220;Atlas Shrugged,&#8221; Rand incorporated her philosophical viewpoints into a highly debated novel that has been drawing negative criticism but a devoted fanbase for decades. Rand, a philosopher and author, was known for developing the philosophical system of Objectivism, which advocated reason as the only method of gaining knowledge and emphasized laissez-faire (or hands-off) capitalism in politics. This should sound familiar, as the recent rapid rise of the Tea Party in American politics gave John Aglialoro, a producer/financier, the idea to finally bring a film version of the &#8220;unfilmable&#8221; &#8220;Atlas Shrugged&#8221; to the big screen. However, the film received an atrocious 9% score on Rotten Tomatoes (which measures critics&#8217; reviews), with only 3 positive reviews out of 35 overall. And with middling box office returns added to the public perception of the film, Aglialoro has spoken out against film critics for their hatred of &#8220;individualism&#8221; and stated his plans to make two follow-up films.<span id="more-1164"></span></p>
<p>Unlike most feature films produced through the Hollywood system, Aglialoro spent $10 million of his money to finance the film through an independent studio. &#8220;Atlas Shrugged: Part 1&#8221; also avoided conventional marketing norms and instead concentrated on the Internet and talk radio to get word out about the film and attract a niche audience of those who share Rand&#8217;s political views. Specifically, Aglialoro was hoping to attract Libertarians and Tea Party followers, an effort that seems to have at least partially worked. Despite the critical drubbing and poor box office, Rotten Tomatoes also indicates that 85% of the audience who voted on their website actually recommends the film. However, the film is becoming well-known for some of the harsh reviews it has received. Peter Travers of <em>Rolling Stone</em> gave the movie zero stars and said &#8220;the novel gets the l0w-budget, no-talent treatment and sits there flapping on screen like a bludgeoned seal,&#8221; while Vadim Rizov of <em>Boxoffice Magazine </em>called the film &#8220;lifeless as entertainment and incoherent as ideology.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aglialoro has accused professional film critics of having a political agenda while speaking out about the film. &#8220;It was a nihilistic craze. Not in the history of Hollywood has 16 reviewers said the same low things about a movie. They&#8217;re lemmings. What&#8217;s their fear of Ayn Rand? They hate this woman. They hate individualism,&#8221; he said in this <em>Hollywood Reporter </em>article. Aglialoro also indicated his desire to continue making adaptations of &#8220;Atlas Shrugged,&#8221; both because particular audiences have responded well to it and as a means of spiting the critics. He also acknowledged that future films should most likely have different marketing strategies to expose them to a wider audience, perhaps by partnering with a major studio or spending more money to advertise the films on television and open them on more theaters.</p>
<p>The limited success of &#8220;Atlas Shrugged: Part 1&#8221; with a narrow audience and the completely negative reaction to it from nearly everyone else shows many things about success in the film industry. To attract a broad audience and win the approval of film critics, filmmakers cannot simply rely on a cult audience to bring in profits. While many films in the past saw box office success despite critics&#8217; negative opinions, the reviews on &#8220;Atlas Shrugged: Part 1&#8221; were <em>so </em>bad that it likely deterred many from seeing the film. The lack of traditional marketing also likely contributed to the film&#8217;s failure. Aglialoro concentrated largely on getting fans of the book and Rand&#8217;s followers to come out to see the film, but the focus on this group was so specific that it alienated everyone else. The Internet can be an effective marketing enhancer when a film is already being promoted through print and other forms of mass media; however, it cannot be the sole marketing technique. &#8220;Atlas Shrugged: Part 1,&#8221; true to its title, was met with indifference from the general audience, and it remains to be seen whether Aglialoro&#8217;s hopes for parts 2 and 3 will be met with a similar response or worse&#8230;</p>

<p>Cecillia Kang. (8, April 2011). Web firms face increased federal scrutiny over Internet privacy. <em>The Washington Post. </em>Retrieved from <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/web-firms-face-increased-federal-scrutiny-over-internet-privacy/2011/04/06/AFvREp1C_story.html">http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/web-firms-face-increased-federal-scrutiny-over-internet-privacy/2011/04/06/AFvREp1C_story.html</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Internet radio, such as Pandora, used with linking pin power roles such as the smartphone mobile industry, was recently subpoenaed by the government on the terms of illegal distribution of personal information.  When a user logs into an internet related radio site on their smartphone, their private information is given to that certain company to be distributed to their client power role, the advertisers.  Using Pandora, (although other internet related radio websites have been included in this court hearing) a federal grand jury served this subpoena in order to justify that these services disclose users personal information such as telephone number, gender, personal interests, and other information, illegally.</p>
<p><span id="more-1100"></span></p>
<p>Not only are the internet radio sites being reevaluated for their privacy terms, but most of the internet is also, involving the internet power role.  In a Washington post article, the associated press tells that the Federal Trades Commission is now wanting to post a &#8220;Do Not Track&#8221; option for internet users.  The federal grand jury investigation is prominent on declining Pandora&#8217;s ability to access users information from their smartphone accounts.  Having advertisers as client power roles, Pandora released the private information to third parties for these advertisers to see the demographics and the amount of users on their site.  &#8220;Pandora said it shared information with third parties to help it track how users interact with the service and to deliver targeted advertising. But the company, based in Oakland, Calif., said it was “not a specific target” of the grand jury investigation.&#8221; (NYtimes.com)</p>
<p>Because internet radio is an enormous distributor and exhibitor power role, it will be extremely hard to shut it down; along with all the other cloud-based radio stations.  But having the &#8220;Do Not Track&#8221; option on their website will definitely create a boundary when it comes to gathering information for targeting their audiences for their paying advertisers.  &#8220;In its filing, Pandora said that a government Do Not Track mandate &#8216;could significantly hinder our ability to collect and use data relating to listeners&#8217; &#8220;(NYtimes.com).</p>

</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are we beginning to count on the Internet for everything?  Not only are we beginning to rely on our music playlists created on online streaming cloud-based sites, but the founders of Skype are betting on our usual creation of playlists created in iTunes, are moving to &#8216;<a href="http://www.indystar.com/article/20110403/BUSINESS06/304030004/1281/BUSINESS06">celestial jukeboxes</a>&#8216; listened to through the Internet.  These internet radio stations, and cloud-based playlist options, are becoming new distributors for artists&#8217; music.  We aren&#8217;t completely forgetting about terrestrial radio in cars, and on systems in the house, but when people are choosing to listen to these internet streams they immediately think, well&#8230; can I play this in my car? Around the house?  In the bathroom?  And with the emergence of new technologies that support the access of these internet &#8220;user-created&#8221; stations and playlists, industries of many different types want to get their feet in the door.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span id="more-1043"></span></p>
<p>Linking with the music industry, radio is now becoming an on-demand service.  Listeners are able to pick their music, and if they have the technologies acquired for listening to their music, they will be more than willing to do so.  The automobile industry, smartphone industry, and the television industry are all becoming exhibitors and distributors for this idea of the &#8221; &#8216;celestial jukebox&#8217; of the Internet, allowing listeners to play virtually any song, any time, anywhere, through a variety of Internet-linked devices.&#8221;  Not only do we see the Internet becoming a huge producer and distributor for the internet radio, its facilitation is allowing for extreme variety when it comes to listening to music.</p>
<p>This is extremely threatening to FM/AM radio.  Those who will have access to these streaming sites will begin to acknowledge the fact that they are willing to pay a subscription fee/month to be able to listen to any music of their choice.  Instead of turning on the radio, hearing the same 20 songs played by the hour, and listening to boring, ever-lasting advertisements, they can subscribe to the internet radio sites, create their own playlists, and enjoy the music that they want to hear.  Some of these cloud-based sites aren&#8217;t subscription based yet, so they still need the support of the advertising power role, but in time they will build up to being subscription based.</p>
<p>&#8220;<a href="http://mog.com/">Mog</a> and <a href="http://www.rdio.com/">Rdio</a> offer subscribers unlimited access for a set monthly fee &#8212; $9.99 for both companies. For that amount, subscribers can select any song from a catalog of 8 million to 10 million tunes and listen through any device connected to the Internet.&#8221;  These are other Internet radio sites like Pandora and Slacker radio, and are giving people the chance of unlimited access for a small fee.  These sites can be accessed in the car, on a smartphone, and even on the television. &#8221; For times they lack an Internet connection, subscribers can store songs to a phone or laptop, music they can use as long as they subscribe.&#8221;  This is an extremely important feature because I&#8217;m sure the client-based roles were concerned with this aspect.  Not only could this bump out iTunes as a music distributor and exhibitor, but it can also knock out mp3&#8217;s and CD&#8217;s.  All in all, the internet is beginning to control not only social life, but how we now listen to music, and understand radio.  We don&#8217;t envision radio as talkshows, or advertisements anymore, because we have the ability to create the music played for us on &#8220;our&#8221; own, creator made radio stations.</p>
