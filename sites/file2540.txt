<p>Communicating sustainability concepts to the community at large is a challenge, especially considering the flood of misinformation in the mainstream media. Effective communication can be quite challenging, because we often need to make scientific concepts, technical data, and moral &amp; ethical &amp; moral issues clear and engaging to the public.</p>
<p>While it is difficult to spell out in the specific activities &amp; topics months in advance, it is safe to say that interns will likely work on print, online, and in-person communications, including reports, posters, presentations, web pages, and/or news releases — and this may at times include controversial issues.</p>
<p>One challenging ‘umbrella’ topic is the extent to which media &amp; communication reinforce the unsustainable practices that are causing so many of our problems, instead of helping move to a more sustainable future. Examples of likely focus areas for 2019 include the following, all of which have technical, social-justice, and community engagement aspects::</p>
<ul>
<li>Community planning &amp; governance that often seems to benefit developers at the expense of the community</li>
<li>Education (Pre-K–12 and higher ed) that has failed to make young people ‘sustainability literate’</li>
<li>Justice systems that exacerbate problems of inequality and injustice</li>
<li>‘Business as usual’ approaches that perpetuate problems.</li>
</ul>
<p>Specific activities depend in part on what is happening in the community during the internship</p>
<p>Note: This internship is usually also available with a graphic design focus for qualified students.</p>
