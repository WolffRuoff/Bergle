Through this work, HYPE helps advance the outreach and social justice mission of the Media &amp; Communication Department, while providing opportunities for Muhlenberg students to collaborate on cultural productions with younger peers.  The department has a longstanding commitment to providing young people access to media tools and practices, established early on by the late Jim Schneider, who used video to help center city Allentown youth tell their stories.  Today, HYPE is a partnership between the department and the Lehigh Valley Health Network.  Students interested in working with HYPE during the summer or academic year can contact Lora Taub-Pervizpour at ltaub@muhlenberg.edu or Jenna Azar at jazarhype@gmail.com for more information.</p>
