								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Peoples, G. (15 April 2011). Vice President Joe Biden calls piracy ‘outright theft.’ <em>Billboard</em>. Retrieved from <a href="http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/industry/legal-and-management/vice-president-joe-biden-calls-piracy-outright-1005136622.story">http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/industry/legal-and-management/vice-president-joe-biden-calls-piracy-outright-1005136622.story</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://images1.variety.com/graphics/photos/_storypics/biden_joe_piracy.jpg" alt="" width="175" height="117" />Stricter copyright laws may be looming, if comments by Vice President Joe Biden are any indication. In an <a href="http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/industry/legal-and-management/vice-president-joe-biden-calls-piracy-outright-1005136622.story">interview</a> with the Hollywood trade magazine <em><a href="http://www.variety.com/Home/">Variety</a></em>, he took a personal stand against piracy (both music and movies), calling it “outright theft.” Industry executives are hopeful that this strong language indicates that Washington is willing to push through new regulations on streaming and downloading despite other drastically more important issues that the White House and Congress should be tackling instead.</p>
<p><span id="more-1145"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to Billboard, Biden’s statements leave “little doubt about where the White House stands on piracy.” This is ridiculous, of course. One of the cardinal rules of politics is to leave a little bit of doubt about your position on everything to avoid those embarrassing “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read_my_lips:_no_new_taxes">read my lips, no new taxes</a>” moments. Biden does this, clumsily, by hinting that the entertainment industry isn’t devoting enough resources to educating the public about piracy. Recording industry executives, however, salivate every time someone in the authority role publicly takes their side. This is because industry people fully understand how important the authority power role is to their business.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s no secret that the recording industry spends more time suing consumers in court than actually producing decent music for those consumers to buy (or steal). And the industry’s success in the courtroom depends crucially on their lobbying success in Washington. Biden’s interview with <em>Variety</em> comes at a time when the White House is busy <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/ip_white_paper.pdf">drafting revisions to U.S. copyright law</a> that will strongly favor the recording industry. First on the block: unauthorized music streaming, the mainstay of facilitators like <a href="http://listen.grooveshark.com">Grooveshark</a>, which the new rules may officially prohibit for the first time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Producers within the recording industry have argued for stricter downloading and streaming rules for years. The industry’s main facilitator, the <a href="http://riaa.org/physicalpiracy.php">RIAA</a>, plasters its website with the <a href="http://riaa.org/physicalpiracy.php">scary numbers behind piracy</a>: $12.5 billion in lost revenue every year, $2.7 billion in lost worker earnings, and 71,060 lost jobs. The money the labels make from sucking their own “artists” dry through exploitative contracts may help lessen this impact, especially if they start passing some of their ill-gotten earnings from their major executives’ pockets to their “workers.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ironically, the ones really feeling the kick of illegal downloading are the exhibitors. The operators of Borders, Barnes and Noble, and Wal-Mart stores are the ones whose pockets you’re actually stealing from when you download <a href="http://rebeccablackonline.com/">Rebecca Black</a>’s new album from Pirate Bay instead of purchasing it. Whether or not the record companies will start sharing any new revenue generated from increased enforcement of copyright laws with artists and exhibitors remains to be seen, but it’s highly unlikely.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ultimately, the recording industry will probably pressure Washington into passing stricter copyright rules. The bulk of the politicians’ electorate—old people—couldn’t care less about music downloading laws, and the people most affected by it—Generation Y—are generally politically disengaged and/or powerless. In a time when arguments about funding for Social Security and international wars are threatening to shut down the government, a new copyright law is an easy pass, and this one will probably slip through Congress unnoticed. The impact it will have on each person’s individual music experience, however, is still uncertain.</p>
