								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Without a doubt, technology has made an incredible impact on the lives of young adults in such an extensive amount of ways. Additionally, &#8220;technology has certainly transformed our libraries. Public Internet access is available at almost every public library, even the smallest and most rural&#8221; (Walter &amp; Myers, 2003, p.50). Young adults have grown up in such a rapidly changing technological era that they automatically expect to see computers when they visit the library, and librarians in return expect to see teens actively using the computers. A recent study funded by the Pew Charitable Trust found that at least 78% of all young people between the ages of twelve and seventeen go online for school or personal use (Walter &amp; Myers, 2003). The number of homes with computers and Internet access has grown significantly over the last several years so much to the point that students themselves are concerned about the digital divide. At times, it can be difficult to be forced to rely on home computers for school assignments, and computers may not always be adequate for purposes of certain assignments (Walter &amp; Myers, 2003).</p>
<p>In an effort to try to keep up with the constant developments of new technologies, public libraries have started providing technologically savvy homework helpers who can accommodate teens&#8217; need for information and their preference for digital media. Young adults have found that the Internet not only assists with communication amongst friends and family, but they also feel that the Internet gives them a broader voice (Walter &amp; Myers, 2003). &#8220;Through electronic discussion lists and chat rooms, they can speak and listen to a far more diverse community than they can in their own geographical neighborhoods&#8221; (Walter &amp; Myers, 2003, p.50).</p>
<p>Since the Internet provides users with unlimited access to information, it is so important to be careful of how you use the Internet. As mentioned in several Ted Talks and in articles discussed in class in regards to privacy, especially now in the digital age, it is becoming more important than ever to be cognizant of what you are searching, downloading, and signing up for. With that in mind, young adults deserve the right to prove themselves as being responsible Internet users until a problem occurs. The Internet is such a useful, convenient, tool, it just needs to be used for appropriate purposes.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have we really reached a world that we might have to start using social Media to enhance our learning? Technology has already changed the way kids are learning so I couldn’t imagine kids using social media to learn. Using social media to learn would be very hard to do because kids most likely do not even focus on the work they would be reading up on their news feeds and talking to friends, but in the same senses I feel that kids would absorb information if it was laid out in social media. If your class was set up as a twitter feed I’m sure many kids would have such an easy time navigating through the work. It would be very interesting to see someone try to set a class up like that, or even if it was set up as Facebook.</p>
<p>But social media can be used in many other different ways for learning. Like in the article “Twitter for teaching: Can social media be used to enhance the process of learning?” Chris Evans does research to see if Twitter helps enhances the process of learning, but he uses students who have never used twitter before. It is interesting to see students who haven’t used twitter before become introduced to it in an educational way.</p>
<p>Evans has the students interact with their tutor over twitter using hashtags so that it is easy for the tutors to be able to go and look at what each student is asking. Evans asks in his research if this replaces kids being able to go to class, which he showed that it doesn’t cause even though the students question or concern might be answered, it can never replace the act of walking in to a class and sitting down for a lecture. Social media can never replace the act of going in to a classroom and having a face to face interaction with a teacher or professor.</p>
<p>Evans studied many different aspects of twitter and educations and he figured out that yes it did help students get more evolved and engage in what they were learning. But you will never be able to replace the classroom, social media will be able to help enhance learning. But I don’t think it will ever replace it.</p>
<p>This is something that as my generation gets older should start paying attention to because there might be a day where our kids don’t even go and sit in a class room. They will be learning everything online. They might not even know what a text book is because they will most likely be caring around a tablet or some technological devices that holds all their information that they need.</p>
<p>Our parents telling us how they remember a day without all this technology, we will be saying to our kids how we remember the days of text books and sitting in classrooms. At some point though I think someone will need to step in and make sure that the idea of sitting in a class room remains that way. Because we don’t want future generations not learning how to socialize in person and not getting those learning experiences that we get.</p>
<p>The movement of technology needs to start slowing down and we need to start looking at how much time we spend already looking at a screen. Its unhealthy and the last thing I would want is to be taking classes all online and using social media to help.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of Apple&#8217;s newest products, the Apple Watch, made its debut in the Spring of 2015. It is an incredible device, and it&#8217;s popularity has exploded because people love the thought of technology right at their fingertips.The watch &#8220;quickly became the best-selling wearable device with the shipment of 4.2 million smartwatches in the second quarter of 2015&#8221; (&#8220;Apple Watch,&#8221; 2015). Apple watch allows you to view text messages and e-mails right on your wrist, while allowing you to keep your iPhone in your pocket (&#8220;Apple Watch,&#8221; 2015). People like this because it comes off as more professional. For example, if an attendee is in the middle of a meeting, it typically isn&#8217;t appropriate for him or her to pull out a phone. However, if the attendee is just looking at their watch, chances are no one can tell the difference. Additionally, users can hold phone conversations and speak right into the watch to reply to messages. This is helpful because people like to be able to manage their time as efficiently as possible. Since the apple watch gives people such easy access to technology, it&#8217;s popularity is going to continue to reflect that.</p>
<p>Through the Fitness app on the watch, people can track their physical activity and send data back to their phone to keep for future records (&#8220;Apple Watch,&#8221; 2015).This feature of the watch is just another of many reasons that people are so drawn to this technology. People no longer have to carry additional equipment with them, aside from their phone and watch, to track their physical activity throughout their day. This is also a huge convenience piece, and people are majorly in favor of it. Interestingly enough even with this convenience factor in mind that draw people to purchase the watch, there have been some negative reviews. &#8220;Many reviewers described the watch as functional and convenient, while also noting failure to offer as much potential functionality as preceding smartphones&#8221; (&#8220;Apple Watch,&#8221; 2015). However, even with mixed reviews, people are still going to be interested in purchasing the watch to explore it for themselves, and still consider it a convenient tool that they can have easy access to.</p>
<p>The Apple Watch comes in different collections, sizes, and colors, providing buyers with lots of choice (&#8220;Apple Watch,&#8221; 2015). Today&#8217;s generation goes crazy at the thought of a thinner, sleeker, piece of technology because of it&#8217;s convenience factor. Apple Watch, along with many other new technologies have proven that people are willing to pay a hefty price just so that they can have the latest and greatest. People want to be able to access technology while putting forth the least amount of effort possible.</p>
<p>In conclusion, Apple Watch is a great example of a new technology that has attracted the attention of millions simply because of its look, its usefulness, and its incredibly small size. Apple watch does it all, and it is going to continue to be a huge success as more versions come out in the future.</p>
