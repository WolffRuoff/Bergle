								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left">     Mike Hanski&#8217;s article titled &#8220;Want to be a Better Writer? Read More.&#8221; discusses the importance of how reading can benefit numerous aspects of the self. Some of his major points included that reading influences your writing, influences your study, and most importantly in my opinion, increases your vocabulary. Having a well-built vocabulary is not only beneficial for your writing and for school, but for everyday life. After college when it comes time to apply and interview for jobs it is valuable to have an understanding of complex concepts and be able to converse intelligently as you get older. Hanski states that &#8220;reading widens a vocabulary, broadens a kid&#8217;s mind, and helps him understand the world better&#8221; (p.2). These are tools that are beneficial for a lifetime.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">     When I am reading and come across a word that seems unfamiliar, taking a few minutes to research the definition always makes a huge difference in my understanding of the reading. Additionally, I am learning new terms that I hopefully will be able to apply and make new ideas out of in future writings. As I build my vocabulary, I find that the quality of my writing increases, in addition to my overall performance in school. This is not only a huge confidence booster, but it encourages me to read more. I find that I feel most motivated to read when it is on a topic that I am interested in. I enjoy reading for pleasure beyond the reading that is assigned in class because it helps me to find where my interests are. Reading newspapers and non-fiction stories allow you to learn about the world which is so important to be knowledgable about. Today, with access to such a vast amount of portable technology such as Kindles, iPads, and iPhones, access to reading material has become easier than ever. In conclusion, if I didn&#8217;t read as much as I do, I would find myself struggling when it comes time to write papers and have to apply my knowledge into real world activities.</p>
