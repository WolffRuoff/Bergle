Jordan, Ph.D.</strong>, of the Annenberg Public Policy Center in Philadelphia, PA.</p>
<p>The title of the lecture is: <span style="color: #ff0000"><strong>The Role of Media in Childhood Obesity: Causes, Consequences, Solutions</strong></span><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Date &amp; Time: Thursday, March 18, 2010, 7:00 PM  Location: Seegers Great Room </strong></p>
<p>Dr. Jordan&#8217;s presentation will look at the relationship between children’s use of electronic media and obesity, exploring the mechanisms underlying the relationship.  In her talk, Dr. Jordan will discuss her research on the role of food marketing in shaping what children eat, when they eat, and what they eat.  She will also present findings of studies that examine how excessive screen time shapes physical activity, sedentary behavior, and sleep habits in children.  Dr. Jordan concludes by highlighting ways in which new media technologies can encourage children to be more active and how marketing strategies can be leveraged to alter children’s food choices.</p>
<p><strong>Amy Beth Jordan </strong>is director of the Media and the Developing Child sector of the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania, where she oversees research on children’s media policy and directs the post-doctoral fellowship program. Her studies have examined the implementation and impact of federal media policy.  Her research also explores the effectiveness of media self-regulation.</p>
<p>Dr. Jordan has published the findings of her research in dozens of peer-reviewed journal articles and book chapters, and has edited special issues of academic journals, including the Journal of Applied Developmental Psychology, the Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, and the Journal of Children and Media.  She is author of editor of several books, including Children, Adolescents and the Media and Messages and Public Health. Dr. Jordan is regularly interviewed for television, radio, newspapers and magazines as a children’s media scholar.  In addition, she has frequently been asked to provide expert testimony in state and federal hearings in which children’s media policy is being considered.</p>
<p>Dr. Jordan is the recipient of the International Communication Association’s Best Applied/Policy Research Award and the National Communication Association’s Stanley L. Saxon Applied Research Award. She received her B.A. Muhlenberg College and her M.A. and Ph.D. from the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania.</p>
