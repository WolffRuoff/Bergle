					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;As a fellow volunteer at Community Bike Works, I loved working with Charlie, and also reminiscing about my experiences as a chem major back in college in the 70s.  He was not only a mentor for our kids, but his patience, sense of humor, and teaching methods served as valuable examples for us volunteers. He will be sorely missed. His kindness and positive influence on us, but especially on so many children, serve as a precious legacy to an all around great guy.  A terrible loss for Muhlenberg College, Community Bike Works, and our community.&lt;/p&gt;
