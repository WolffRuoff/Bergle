								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bruno, A. (16 March 2011). MTV launches Hive website, latest effort to refocus on music. <em>Billboard</em>. Retrieved from <a href="http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/industry/digital-and-mobile/mtv-launches-hive-website-latest-effort-1005075732.story#">http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/industry/digital-and-mobile/mtv-launches-hive-website-latest-effort-1005075732.story#</a></p>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/photos/stylus/1037809-MTV-Hive.png" alt="" width="200" height="140" />The empty acronym formerly known as Music Television (MTV) debuted a new website this week that focuses on…music. The new site, called “<a href="http://www.mtvhive.com/">Hive</a>,” will feature music videos, interviews, book reviews by artists, polls, music popularity tracking meters, and editorials by the company’s top executives. It appears to represent an effort by MTV to reinvent its image after recent Reality- show scandals, including a child pornography investigation surrounding its shock-schlock show <em>Skins</em>.</p>
<p><span id="more-955"></span></p>
<p>MTV wasn’t always a Reality TV depot. At its peak, MTV was one of the most important exhibitors in the music industry. Eighties and nineties kids often heard new music for the first time on the network’s popular request shows, and MTV’s decision to promote or marginalize a new artist could make or break a recording company’s profits for an entire year. The network also transformed the music video into a form of mass media, forcing the labels to dump millions of dollars a year into producing high-quality and catchy videos for audiences.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, over a decade after jumping onto the Reality TV bandwagon, MTV apparently wants to recapture some of its former image (and power). The network will exhibit music on the site, with a section for users to access new and vintage music videos and buy MP3s. Alongside the actual music will be polls that track users’ opinions of new artists, videos that feature <a href="http://www.mtvhive.com/playlists/76BA27020227BA7600010227BA76/mgid:playlist:video:mtvmusic.com:71585">sometimes bizarre</a> consumer reviews of music videos, and a feature called <a href="http://www.mtvmusicmeter.com/">Music Meter</a>, which claims to track an artists’ popularity on social media and downloading sites. MTV’s many Top Ten countdowns and on-air VJ reviews made it a facilitator for the music industry since its inception, and network executives are clearly hoping to carry that role online. To help with the transition, the network is bringing in veteran music industry linking pin Jessica Robertson, who helped <em><a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/">Rolling Stone</a> </em>and <em><a href="http://www.spinner.com/">Spinner</a></em> digitize and re-format their content for the Internet age.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In some ways, it’s surprising that MTV waited so long to overhaul its website. This is the network that has exploited almost every synergistic media connection possible, from television series to a movie division. Now that MTV is finally ready to “flex some music muscles,” as network president Van Toffler says, it may already be too late. MTV’s core demographic, the teen to twenties group, has been getting MP3s and music news online from sources that look suspiciously like MTV’s new website, including <a href="http://www.billboard.com/#/">Billboard</a>, for over a decade. Hive will have to include some outstanding features to draw users away from their established online music outlets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One notable feature of the site is the complete lack of traditional “advertising.” Of course, that’s largely because the site is one big advertisement for all artists whose labels have made deals with MTV to sell merchandise, concert tickets, and MP3s on the site, along with other promotion deals. In fact, the same criticisms that the network faced at its peak are likely to carry over to the new website. For years, critics argued that MTV was the prime homogenization force in the music industry, squeezing out smaller artists whose indie labels couldn’t pay to make high-profile deals with the network. It’s not hard to imagine that any concert tickets or merchandise sold on Hive won’t be for your local neighborhood ska band’s next gig. It’s not really that MTV doesn’t like indie artists. MTV has a bottom line to worry about, and music and promotion deals with Sony and EMI are more likely to increase it than smaller labels.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, it’s not really MTV doing all these things at all. MTV is actually owned by <a href="http://www.viacom.com/Pages/default.aspx">Viacom</a>, a massive media conglomerate that owns a number of television channels (including Nickelodeon) and a diversified portfolio of other media holdings. Viacom is interested in promoting the same content across multiple channels and making deals with reliable companies who they know will follow through on their commitments. Large national corporations don’t necessarily have time to deal with the eccentric smaller indie labels. MTV probably initially jumped into bed with Viacom because it couldn’t afford to do that, either. Like most things, it all comes down to money.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MTV apparently hopes to offer more local music listings and services in the future, but there’s no trace of those features on Hive. As the Internet becomes the primary exhibition and distribution outlet for music, corporations like MTV that specialize in music may eventually have to “own the local” in much the same way newspapers and radio stations had to with the advent of television. It’s too early to tell whether Hive will allow MTV to re-enter some of its former power roles in the music industry. Given Viacom’s financial backing, however, the network certainly has a fighting chance.</p>
