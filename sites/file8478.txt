								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At one point in the article “Want to Be a Better Writer? Read More.” author Mike Hanski claims that every writer’s purpose for writing are the people that will eventually read the work. Hanski’s statement is proven to be true throughout the entire article with his choice of diction which acts as the driving force behind relaying the aforementioned message. With his strategic word choice, Hanski is able to subtly persuade his audience to believe that reading is an essential component in the journey to becoming a successful writer by keeping his audience in mind while writing.</p>
<p>In the first full paragraph, Hanski refers to reading in a positive, upbeat manner to make it seem inviting and fun. A few words that immediately stand out are “fashionable”, “cool”, “awesome”, and “wonderful.” Although these adjectives are not all referring to reading directly, they all have a helpful impact indirectly. Hanski uses such words because he hopes that they will cause his audience to think about all of the positive effects of and thoughts about reading and writing rather than negative ones. Due to the pleasant thoughts that come to the minds of the audience, Hanski’s persuasion becomes effective.</p>
<p>Contrary to initial thought, Hanski does not only focus on the positive effects of reading; he also spends some time reviewing the negative results of not reading. Abandoning his use of positive vocabulary seen in the beginning of the article, Hanski switches to a darker choice of words. He brings up “social exclusion”, “illiteracy”, and “unemployment” which are all undesirable situations to be in. By bringing up such circumstances, he assumes that the reader will realize how serious it is if a person has poor reading habits/abilities because no reader will read this section and think that he or she wants to be in any of the mentioned categories.</p>
<p>In the grand scheme of things, Hanski’s main goal is not to only display the fact that positive words lead to positive thoughts and vice versa; rather, Hanski wants the words in his article to work in a way that will leave a lasting impression on the reader. Because of this objective Hanski does not use trite words such as “good” or “bad” which do not have the same effects that the wisely selected ones have on its’ readers. Nonetheless, it is quite clear that Hanski followed his own advice and wrote his article while keeping his target audience in mind. Throughout the entirety of the article Hanski shed light on all of the positive aspects of reading even though sometimes his description came off as something negative. Due to his very carefully chosen words, Hanski produced an article that truly persuades the readers that reading is a paramount mechanism in order to become a triumphant writer.</p>
