<p>Our Observations:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Grafton Street is a popular attraction for both tourists and Irish citizens alike. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Paved and pedestrian-only, it has a unique atmosphere with top quality shops, flower stands, and buskers along the route. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Throughout the busy street, you can find people shopping, chatting, meeting up with friends and simply taking in the vibrant scene. Located in center city Dublin, Grafton street runs from St. Stephens to college green, only a short walk from the Temple Bar District as well as Trinity College. On the day we ventured to Grafton Street, March 19th, it was quite a cold, however, the su</span><span style="font-size: 14px">n was shining and visitors seemed to be enjoying their afternoon. It should be noted that March 19th is a bank holiday in Ireland, meaning that many people have the day off of work. To our surprise, we did not observe very many people on their phones, or in their “phone space” as Wilken and Goggin (2017) discuss (p. 60). Almost everyone, with the exception of a few phone users, were present in their “local space,” not witnessing the street through their phon</span><span style="font-size: 14px">es but actually being present in the place. After a few minutes of walking around, it dawned on us that we were actually lost in our “phone space” as we attempted to document the environment around us. The people who we did notice were on their phone seemed to be shifting their attention back and forth from exciting activities taking place on the street to whatever they were doing on their phone. Wilken and Goggin describe this phenomenon, “for technologically equipped pedestrians, for instance, attention is always a fluctuating state, where pedestrians tend to switch their attention from one activity to another, each time at the expense of the last and as a result of competing stimuli.” Passerby’s on their mobile phones were in their “phone space” one second and in the blink of an eye, their gaze was back to their “local space” when a busker began performing. This clearly exemplified Wilken and Goggin’s idea that place, with the domestication of mobile phones, is an “experience of distraction and disjointedness” (p. 60). By keenly observing pedestrians on Grafton Street, we were able to witness just how intensely the definition of ‘place’ has changed with the invention and domestication of mobile phones.</span></p>

<p>Domestication is a concept that is used in many fields like sociology of technology, media and communication studies. It deals with how technology is accepted, used or rejected by people and covers analyses and descriptions of processes that govern these choices. By using a theory such as this one, we can look at the various ways in which we incorporate our smartphones into our everyday lives. Maddie, a great friend, and fellow iPhone user, doesn&#8217;t use her phone all day every day but checks it frequently. In the morning the first thing she does is turn off her alarm (which is an application of the iPhone) because that&#8217;s what wakes her up. Then, she will usually check to see if she has any messages or calls that came while she was sleeping. Next, she will usually check all of her social media. This includes Instagram, Twitter, and Snapchat. She said that if she slept through her alarm and was late for whatever she had that morning that she would still check her phone quickly but maybe not respond to them until she wasn&#8217;t in a rush for time. So, even though she still makes time for her phone in a sticky situation, she doesn&#8217;t let it take total priority over her life. However, she said that she would respond in that situation if it were urgent. She said if she doesn&#8217;t have a busy day ahead of her that she will use it for around an hour in the morning. Also, Maddie checks it a lot at night before going to bed. &#8220;It really just depends on what kind of day I&#8217;m having.&#8221; So, depending on how busy she is will determine her amount of phone usage for that given day. She then went on to say that the phone activity she has during her day pertains more towards things that actually involve her day. However, at night she takes that time to catch up with old friends or possibly even call her parents.</p>
<p>When looking at her individual dimensions, Maddie says that she checks her phone at least 100 times a day. This doesn&#8217;t mean that she is actually using her phone but just that she is checking to see if she has any notifications. &#8220;Even if I&#8217;m not expecting a message, I&#8217;ll still check it.&#8221; So, at times, she, like many other iPhone users, get caught looking for ghost notifications. This is when you don&#8217;t actually hear or feel your phone get a notification, but our curiosity drives us towards checking anyway, just in case we may have one. Her main apps include Messaging, Email, Twitter, Snapchat, Facebook, and YouTube. Maddie, like me, is a huge user of YouTube and knows just exactly how much time it can take up. She then went on to say that Messaging is her top application but has gotten more use to using Snapchat ever since she has been abroad. This could be because she is either documenting the various places she goes to or even just sending a quick and easy update to a friend. As for importance, these apps are meaningful towards her because they create the opportunity for mass communication with anyone and everyone. So basically, they just keep her connected with everyone that is special to her no matter where they are. I then went on to ask who her top three people that she communicates with. &#8220;Honestly, my mom, dad, and Jess.&#8221; When traveling, whether it be around other countries or even just Ireland, she finds that both Mytaxi and her maps are a crucial part of her day. Even if she has been to a place already, she still finds herself just making sure that she&#8217;s on the right path. Her iPhone story had to do with our trip to Brussels. We were going from Brussels to Brugge, and we were trying to figure out how to walk to the train station. Using maps, she was able to avoid street work, unnecessary paths, and even get us turn by turn directions to find the exact entrance of the train station. &#8220;At that moment, trying to find your way around an unfamiliar place can almost be impossible, but with the help of my iPhone it made it so much easier.&#8221; In this story, it is evident that through domestication theory one can see how impactful Maddie&#8217;s smartphone has been in her life.</p>
<p>When looking at Malleability, Maddie found that she arranged her smartphone towards the necessities of her current everyday life. She has her music, messages, phone, and internet on the bottom of her screen. This is where people&#8217;s primary applications can be found. As for her home page, she has Instagram, Twitter, Youtube, Facebook, Snapchat, Spotify, Whatsapp, MyTaxi, Dublin Bus App. &#8220;Both my four lower applications and my home page tend to change with the times. Apps like the Dublin bus and MyTaxi would never have been on my home page back in America because we use Uber there or just drive. But now that were in Ireland these apps tend to take priority in my life because they do so much for me&#8221;. She then went on to say that, even though there are a lot of apps on her second page that she uses just as much on her home page, she doesn&#8217;t enjoy grouping the apps together (constructing a category of apps so that way you can fit more apps in a given spot while taking up less room). She said that this was because the apps in her home are there for quick and easy access. Being able to just unlock her phone and just hit the app she was looking for is how she prefers her set up. The extra step of having to go into the category and then find the app she wants is just not the set-up she is looking for in her home page. As for her notifications, she does set individual ringtones to certain contacts. However, these contacts only include people that are very important to her. So, people like her mom and dad may have their own ringtones but someone she just met most likely won&#8217;t. She does this so that way when she hears that exact ring she will know who it is without even having to check her phone.</p>
<p>As for Maddie&#8217;s social connections, she said that her mobile phone is extremely crucial no matter who she is connecting with. Whether it be her friends here or her family and friends back home, her mobile phone is a vital tool towards inhibiting that universal connection to others. Her geographic location will determine who she is in contact the most. So being in Ireland, she tends to contact her friends that are here more than her friends that are at home. Even though all her friends maintain the same level of importance, there is just more relevance towards her friends here when looking at her day to day life.</p>
<p>Ultimately, through domestication theory, it can be said that Maddie&#8217;s phone is an extension of who she is. It makes reduces her life of stress and is a tool that allows her to make and keep connections with all those whom she cares about.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong><em>Shaun&#8217;s Interview </em></strong></span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-153" src="http://mobilemedia.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2018/03/IMG_5066-1-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="http://mobilemedia.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2018/03/IMG_5066-1-300x225.jpg 300w, http://mobilemedia.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2018/03/IMG_5066-1-768x576.jpg 768w, http://mobilemedia.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2018/03/IMG_5066-1-1024x768.jpg 1024w, http://mobilemedia.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2018/03/IMG_5066-1-1x1.jpg 1w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>After interviewing Shaun about his mobile media habits, I learned quite a bit about why and how he uses his phone. Domestication Theory describes how technology is integrated into a user’s everyday life (Sullivan, 2018). Through a domestication analysis of Shaun’s mobile use, I was able to gain deeper insight as to how technology has become an integral part of his daily life and what the functions of his cell phone mean to him. Shaun admitted that he uses his cell phone constantly, every day. He said, “I use it in my bed, I use it when I go out, I check my email with it, I use it literally for everything.” I then asked him what time of day he uses his phone most and what does he do on it during these times. He told me that he uses his cell phone most as soon as he wakes up and also before he goes to bed, but not so much during the day. In the morning, as soon as he opens his eyes, he answers messages he received overnight, checks his email, checks his social media apps and finally, watches YouTube if he has extra time. He does similar tasks on his phone before going to sleep, but most of this screen time is taken up by watching YouTube videos and talking to his family as well as his girlfriend on FaceTime. Shaun explained that since arriving in Dublin, he must FaceTime his girlfriend late at night due to the time difference between Ireland and the U.S and due to both of their busy schedules as well. He describes how this has been difficult for the couple since they have never had to work around a time difference when scheduling FaceTime dates before. This is a great example of how Shaun has had to adapt his technology use to his new living situation. Bertel explains that in the domestication process, “smartphones travel with users across the situations of everyday life and are not tied to specific and bounded contexts…” (Bertel, 2017, p. 85). Just from the first few minutes of my interview with Shaun, it was evident how much his cell phone practices have become a part of his everyday life and that he has been forced to adapt to these practices to a new situation, his move to Dublin.</p>
<p>Shaun engages with iMessage, What’s App, Facetime, Instagram, Twitter, Safari, YouTube, and maps, and the Dublin Bus app every day, multiple times a day. He said that using messaging apps and using Facetime are most important to him because they allow him to communicate with his friends and family back home. He also went on to explain that the map app has been also extremely crucial to traveling not only in Dublin but also to other countries in Europe. To get around Dublin, Shaun takes advantage of the Dublin Bus App when he is on-the-go. He said, “the Dublin Bus App is also really important to me because I can use it to see what bus to take, especially when I’m running late to something, which happens quite often.” Bertel writes about the concept of ‘flexible alignment.’ (p. 87). She says that flexible alignment “captures the fact that users routinely consult online information systems just-in-time (e.g. maps, weather apps and bus schedules), which provides them an increased flexibility in their individual management of everyday life” (p. 87). Shaun’s use of the Dublin Bus app exemplifies flexible alignment as he is able to get bus information in order to get around the city every day. Shaun went on to tell me about a time he lost his phone while on a modeling job in New York City. He said that as soon as he realized it wasn’t in his backpack, he sprinted to everywhere they had been taking photographs that day to look for it. “I was freaking out because if I couldn’t find my phone, I would lose all my contacts, photos, and more importantly, I would not be able to navigate my way back home” Shaun stated. Without the increased flexibly of the maps app, Shaun would have a harder time getting back to Long Island; he would have had to ask strangers for directions and look for street signs, but luckily for Shaun, he found his phone in a friend’s backpack.</p>
<p>Phones allow for customization, and according to Bertel (2017), they are malleable. “Smartphones are malleable devices in so far that the content and services to which they provide access may to a high degree be selected and configured by the individual user” (p. 89).  I asked Shaun a little bit about how he organizes his apps to appear on the mail screen. He expressed that he has his most used apps, like iMessage, What’s App, Facetime, Instagram, Twitter, Safari, YouTube, maps, and the Dublin Bus app set up appear on his mail screen simply for convenience purposes. The accessibility of placing one’s most utilized apps on their mail screen has become domesticated. After this discussion, I asked Shaun if he had customized his background photo or ringtones. He said that he had changed the iPhone&#8217;s default photo to a picture of him and his girlfriend when they first got together and that he hadn’t changed any ringtones. Shaun’s change in background photos displays the malleability of smartphones in Domestication Theory, that users adapt their technological devices to fit a life change.</p>
<p>In the last few minutes of my interview with Shaun, we began to discuss how important his mobile phone was to his social connection with others. He explained that he thought it was basically the only way to connect socially with others, especially connecting with friends back home in the U.S. He stated, “at this point, my phone is literally everything, if I didn’t have a phone, I don’t know what I would do.” This statement alone highlights the fact that technology has become an intrinsic part of socialization in Shaun’s daily life. He then talked about how it would be so much more difficult to stay in a committed relationship without the communicative function of his mobile phone. He said he probably contacts his girlfriend and his parents the most via mobile media. Shaun’s mobile phone has become domesticated in many ways throughout his daily life.</p>
