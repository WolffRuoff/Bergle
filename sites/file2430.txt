Kan, M. April 27, 2011. China&#8217;s Baidu Revenue, Profits Up on Strong Traffic Growth.<em> Network World</em>. Retried from <a href="http://www.networkworld.com/news/2011/042811-chinas-baidu-revenue-profits-up.html">http://www.networkworld.com/news/2011/042811-chinas-baidu-revenue-profits-up.html</a></p>
<p>Google dominants search in nearly every corner of the world, except in one: China. Google’s forays into the lucrative Chinese internet search marketplace, which is estimated at 457 million users, have captured less than 20% of the market. Baidu, an eleven year old competitor, offers many similar services to those provided by Google, yet has gained a significant market share by leveraging linking pin power roles. For instance, Baidu is the “default search engine in 80 percent of Andriod phones in China&#8230;because the mobile operating system is open-source software, device manufactures can make changes to it.” Baidu is pre-installed on devices through revenue sharing agreements with manufacturers.</p>
<p><span id="more-1182"></span></p>
<p>Baidu’s power as a exhibitor in the Chinese search market exceeds that of Google in the Unted States (approx. 65%), and rivals Google’s dominance in Europe (closer to 80%). This runs in paradox to the belief that American media power tends to be more concentrated than the European media system. The internet industry differs in this regard from traditional media. One reason may be the entrepreneurial spirit in the United States encourages more imitators and competitors; backed by venture capital firms (an important investor power role in the internet industry) that provide billions of dollars annually to internet start ups.</p>

<p>RBR-TVBR. (2011, April, 25). In-car streaming perceptions, misperceptions examined. <em>Radio Broadcasting Report.</em> Retrieved from http://www.rbr.com/radio/in-car-streaming-numbers-perceptions-misperceptions-examined.html</p>
<p>With the increasing technological growth and use of internet-streaming radio stations such as Pandora, iHeartRadio, and other cloud-based sites, the public still recognizes that the production and distribution of “over-the-air” terrestrial radio remains one of the most used media outlets while driving.  In a recent Radio Broadcasting Report article, it was made known through a survey of 18-44 year olds, that having streaming-internet radio in cars is not a threat at all to the AM/FM radio stations, or even Sirius/XM.  &#8220;The good news is most users of in-car streaming radio continue to use over-the-air radio extensively&#8221; (rbr.com).</p>
<p><span id="more-1171"></span></p>
<p>Using the Automobile Industry as one of their linking pins, internet streaming radio is trying hard to stream themselves over other industries.  Maybe for the satisfaction of becoming a vertically integrated industry, the internet might be a little over zealous when trying to take over multiple media outlets.  The majority of these blogs have focused on the fact that internet radio sites like Pandora, iHeartRadio and many others are becoming major exhibitors for not only just music, but the recording industry itself.  The popularity of streaming internet stations in the car mostly comes from the linking pin of the cellphone industry.  People are able to buy cables that will simply connect their smartphone to the radio.  They won&#8217;t need to buy a full dashboard radio system that will connect their internet radio to the car.  &#8220;It is thought that most of that listening still occurs at home or at work on computers connected to the internet because of the perceived difficulties related to connecting to the internet in the car&#8221; (rbr.com).  When surveys are taken to see how many people are listening to internet radio, we cannot assume that it is just for the car, all these other media outlets still need to be taken into account.</p>
<p>Within the article there are perceptions noted that describe how certain industry and power roles are concerned with these internet radio stations taking over.  The internet might be able to vertically integrate themselves as producers, distributors, and exhibitors due to the fact that our information age has taken rise <em>because</em> of the internet.  To understand the perceptions (or misperceptions) of the internet radio streaming in cars, it would be better to read the <a href="http://www.rbr.com/radio/in-car-streaming-numbers-perceptions-misperceptions-examined.html">article</a> in full.  But in short the four perceptions are: that streaming is not yet happening in the car, once streaming becomes widely available in cars terrestrial radio will be dead, people won&#8217;t pay for an in-dash solution, consumers will want more pre-sets with in-dash systems.</p>
<p>Although this might be a huge exhibitor power role in the future, in-dash internet radio systems need a lot of adjustment to satisfy the consumer.  Although the client power role of the advertisers might see this as a great deal of business for them, only having one automobile producer and distributor for an internet radio system (Ford and its SYNC system) limits the possibility of substantial profit and growth.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bond, Paul. (2011, April 27). &#8216;Atlas Shrugged&#8217; producer promises two sequels despite terrible reviews, poor box office. <em>The Hollywood Reporter</em>.

<p>Typically <a href="http://mediaindustries11.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/04/3446081393_afc9210f55.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1165" src="http://mediaindustries11.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/04/3446081393_afc9210f55-239x300.jpg" alt="" width="239" height="300" srcset="http://mediaindustries11.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/04/3446081393_afc9210f55-239x300.jpg 239w, http://mediaindustries11.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/04/3446081393_afc9210f55.jpg 399w" sizes="(max-width: 239px) 100vw, 239px" /></a>when critics review films , the range of responses vary; however, in the case of &#8220;Atlas Shrugged: Part 1,&#8221; everyone seems to agree&#8230;it sucks. The film, based on Ayn Rand&#8217;s long controversial 1957 novel of the same name, opened on April 15. This is probably news to many of this blog&#8217;s readers, and it&#8217;s news to us as well. In writing the novel &#8220;Atlas Shrugged,&#8221; Rand incorporated her philosophical viewpoints into a highly debated novel that has been drawing negative criticism but a devoted fanbase for decades. Rand, a philosopher and author, was known for developing the philosophical system of Objectivism, which advocated reason as the only method of gaining knowledge and emphasized laissez-faire (or hands-off) capitalism in politics. This should sound familiar, as the recent rapid rise of the Tea Party in American politics gave John Aglialoro, a producer/financier, the idea to finally bring a film version of the &#8220;unfilmable&#8221; &#8220;Atlas Shrugged&#8221; to the big screen. However, the film received an atrocious 9% score on Rotten Tomatoes (which measures critics&#8217; reviews), with only 3 positive reviews out of 35 overall. And with middling box office returns added to the public perception of the film, Aglialoro has spoken out against film critics for their hatred of &#8220;individualism&#8221; and stated his plans to make two follow-up films.<span id="more-1164"></span></p>
<p>Unlike most feature films produced through the Hollywood system, Aglialoro spent $10 million of his money to finance the film through an independent studio. &#8220;Atlas Shrugged: Part 1&#8221; also avoided conventional marketing norms and instead concentrated on the Internet and talk radio to get word out about the film and attract a niche audience of those who share Rand&#8217;s political views. Specifically, Aglialoro was hoping to attract Libertarians and Tea Party followers, an effort that seems to have at least partially worked. Despite the critical drubbing and poor box office, Rotten Tomatoes also indicates that 85% of the audience who voted on their website actually recommends the film. However, the film is becoming well-known for some of the harsh reviews it has received. Peter Travers of <em>Rolling Stone</em> gave the movie zero stars and said &#8220;the novel gets the l0w-budget, no-talent treatment and sits there flapping on screen like a bludgeoned seal,&#8221; while Vadim Rizov of <em>Boxoffice Magazine </em>called the film &#8220;lifeless as entertainment and incoherent as ideology.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aglialoro has accused professional film critics of having a political agenda while speaking out about the film. &#8220;It was a nihilistic craze. Not in the history of Hollywood has 16 reviewers said the same low things about a movie. They&#8217;re lemmings. What&#8217;s their fear of Ayn Rand? They hate this woman. They hate individualism,&#8221; he said in this <em>Hollywood Reporter </em>article. Aglialoro also indicated his desire to continue making adaptations of &#8220;Atlas Shrugged,&#8221; both because particular audiences have responded well to it and as a means of spiting the critics. He also acknowledged that future films should most likely have different marketing strategies to expose them to a wider audience, perhaps by partnering with a major studio or spending more money to advertise the films on television and open them on more theaters.</p>
<p>The limited success of &#8220;Atlas Shrugged: Part 1&#8221; with a narrow audience and the completely negative reaction to it from nearly everyone else shows many things about success in the film industry. To attract a broad audience and win the approval of film critics, filmmakers cannot simply rely on a cult audience to bring in profits. While many films in the past saw box office success despite critics&#8217; negative opinions, the reviews on &#8220;Atlas Shrugged: Part 1&#8221; were <em>so </em>bad that it likely deterred many from seeing the film. The lack of traditional marketing also likely contributed to the film&#8217;s failure. Aglialoro concentrated largely on getting fans of the book and Rand&#8217;s followers to come out to see the film, but the focus on this group was so specific that it alienated everyone else. The Internet can be an effective marketing enhancer when a film is already being promoted through print and other forms of mass media; however, it cannot be the sole marketing technique. &#8220;Atlas Shrugged: Part 1,&#8221; true to its title, was met with indifference from the general audience, and it remains to be seen whether Aglialoro&#8217;s hopes for parts 2 and 3 will be met with a similar response or worse&#8230;</p>

And why should they when the DVR makes it so easy to avoid them?  But the Turner Company, a cable unit owned by the media conglomerate Time Warner, is developing a new strategy to save commercials from falling to their death (ouch!).  The company has undergone a four year effort to create a new kind of advertising strategy that will offer advertisers on the cable networks TBX, TNT, and True something that many others do not: a strong link between the commercial and the TV show that the consumers are viewing. The goal of this effort is to bring consumers back to commercials by making these ads relevant to the specific program and the specific audience.</p>
<p>Turner’s idea is similar to a technique that other networks have come up with, the technique of embedding show content within the commercial breaks.  We saw American Idol trying out this strategy with their “embedded auditions” that ran between commercials.  Networks and advertisers hoped that when viewers saw a flash of that familiar American Idol logo, they would stop fast-forwarding to see the show content, and, with any luck, see some other ads in the process.<span id="more-1155"></span></p>
<p>But the Turner Company’s strategy is a little different: instead of embedding show content into commercial breaks, the company proposes that advertisers work with Turner to create commercials that look or feel like a particular TV program, even though these spots are not actual show content.  The first step in this strategy is to identify particular moments or themes from the TV show that would seem to resonate with audiences or that serve as clear representations of the program.  The Turner Company uses the phrase “tagging” to describe the specific moments or themes that can be integrated into the commercials that will be viewed when the movie or television series is airing. Tuner Company’s thinking behind this tactic is that if the audience watches the television show or series, they must enjoy these themes or moments; therefore if these “tagged” themes are integrated into the commercials when the particular show or series is airing, consumers will be more likely to enjoy and watch the commercials.  So, if this strategy catches on, a company might develop an ad that features an attractive blonde singing in front of a panel of three (probably multi-racial/gender) judges to air during American Idol—it may not be an actual American Idol audition, but it looks like one, so audiences may be more inclined to watch the commercial.</p>
<p>Turner Company has hired several new employees to “tag” specific moments and themes in television series in the hopes of revamping television commercials. An inside source estimates that this new endeavor will cost Turner about a seven-figure sum amount. Linda Yaccarino, Vice President of Turner Entertainment ad sales states, “Such moves are absolutely critical to survival.”  This situation speaks to the enormous power of the client power role, or advertisers.   Turner, a cable distributor, is desperate to make TV attractive for advertisers, as cable networks rely largely on advertisers to make a profit.   As more and more consumers turn to online forms of media, television networks have to compete for advertiser dollars.  We have seen how this has impacted the print industries, which have either faltered or have been forced to go digital as a result of audience erosion and the resulting loss of advertisers.  The Turner Company does not want to suffer the same fate, so it is actively developing new ways to make its TV networks the hot place to advertise.  Plus, this new technique reflects the trend of audience segmentation: advertisers have always chosen to advertise during programs that draw an audience that would be interested in their products, but now there is even more of an opportunity to target an audience through an ad that is tailor-made for a specific audience.</p>
<p>It’s always a little troubling when the line between content creation and advertising gets blurred.  Turner’s mission is to help create commercials that complement television content, but it’s not a stretch to say that this relationship could become reciprocal with television creators creating content that complements commercials.  Or, television creators might be encouraged to dumb down their content so that it will be easier for advertisers to recycle this content in the form of an ad.</p>
<p>But with the incredible commercial zapping capability of DVRs, will the audiences even notice the change in commercials? Yaccarino is hopeful, stating, “A viewer could be ‘zooming through’ with a DVR, but if the advertising looks like the content the viewer tuned in to see in the first place, they may be trained to stop and watch it.” What are we dogs? We will see.</p>

<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://images1.variety.com/graphics/photos/_storypics/biden_joe_piracy.jpg" alt="" width="175" height="117" />Stricter copyright laws may be looming, if comments by Vice President Joe Biden are any indication. In an <a href="http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/industry/legal-and-management/vice-president-joe-biden-calls-piracy-outright-1005136622.story">interview</a> with the Hollywood trade magazine <em><a href="http://www.variety.com/Home/">Variety</a></em>, he took a personal stand against piracy (both music and movies), calling it “outright theft.” Industry executives are hopeful that this strong language indicates that Washington is willing to push through new regulations on streaming and downloading despite other drastically more important issues that the White House and Congress should be tackling instead.</p>
<p><span id="more-1145"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to Billboard, Biden’s statements leave “little doubt about where the White House stands on piracy.” This is ridiculous, of course. One of the cardinal rules of politics is to leave a little bit of doubt about your position on everything to avoid those embarrassing “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read_my_lips:_no_new_taxes">read my lips, no new taxes</a>” moments. Biden does this, clumsily, by hinting that the entertainment industry isn’t devoting enough resources to educating the public about piracy. Recording industry executives, however, salivate every time someone in the authority role publicly takes their side. This is because industry people fully understand how important the authority power role is to their business.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s no secret that the recording industry spends more time suing consumers in court than actually producing decent music for those consumers to buy (or steal). And the industry’s success in the courtroom depends crucially on their lobbying success in Washington. Biden’s interview with <em>Variety</em> comes at a time when the White House is busy <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/ip_white_paper.pdf">drafting revisions to U.S. copyright law</a> that will strongly favor the recording industry. First on the block: unauthorized music streaming, the mainstay of facilitators like <a href="http://listen.grooveshark.com">Grooveshark</a>, which the new rules may officially prohibit for the first time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Producers within the recording industry have argued for stricter downloading and streaming rules for years. The industry’s main facilitator, the <a href="http://riaa.org/physicalpiracy.php">RIAA</a>, plasters its website with the <a href="http://riaa.org/physicalpiracy.php">scary numbers behind piracy</a>: $12.5 billion in lost revenue every year, $2.7 billion in lost worker earnings, and 71,060 lost jobs. The money the labels make from sucking their own “artists” dry through exploitative contracts may help lessen this impact, especially if they start passing some of their ill-gotten earnings from their major executives’ pockets to their “workers.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ironically, the ones really feeling the kick of illegal downloading are the exhibitors. The operators of Borders, Barnes and Noble, and Wal-Mart stores are the ones whose pockets you’re actually stealing from when you download <a href="http://rebeccablackonline.com/">Rebecca Black</a>’s new album from Pirate Bay instead of purchasing it. Whether or not the record companies will start sharing any new revenue generated from increased enforcement of copyright laws with artists and exhibitors remains to be seen, but it’s highly unlikely.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ultimately, the recording industry will probably pressure Washington into passing stricter copyright rules. The bulk of the politicians’ electorate—old people—couldn’t care less about music downloading laws, and the people most affected by it—Generation Y—are generally politically disengaged and/or powerless. In a time when arguments about funding for Social Security and international wars are threatening to shut down the government, a new copyright law is an easy pass, and this one will probably slip through Congress unnoticed. The impact it will have on each person’s individual music experience, however, is still uncertain.</p>

<p>Lee, E. (April 14, 2011). Google Turns in Mixed Quarter; Loses Search-Market Share. <em>Advertising Age</em>. Retrieved from <a id="internal-source-marker_0.5988184520974755" href="http://adage.com/article/digital/google-turns-mixed-quarter-loses-search-market-share/227004/">http://adage.com/article/digital/google-turns-mixed-quarter-loses-search-market-share/227004/</a></p>
<div>When Google posted its second quarter financial reports, the big news that sent Google’s shares down 5 percent was not a 27% increase in revenue to $8.58 billion, $2.3 billion in profit, or a statement by Susan Wojcicki, head of advertising products, that YouTube “is doubling revenue year over year.” Edmond Lee writes “according to search-marketing firm Experian Hitwise, Google dropped its slice of the market from 71% in the first quarter of 2010 to 66% this quarter.” Although still the dominant player in search, Google’s power as a content distributor is lessened, although from the consumers perspective the search engine distributor power role is dominated by a handful of major players, including Bing and Yahoo!.&nbsp;</p>
<div><span id="more-1129"></span></div>
</div>
<p>Freshman Google CEO Larry Page downplayed the sliding search market share, emphasizing “that future growth will come outside of search, so the company is touting the big investments it’s making in display ads, YouTube, mobile and the Chrome web browser.” In a nod to a power roles analysis, Google’s recent acquisition of Next New Networks, “which helps promote webshows and package them to advertisers,” has “prompted Google to set aside as much as $100 million to finance more production across many content partnerships.”Google takes in much of its revenue by leveraging the client power role, and is not known as a producer of content, but rather as an exhibitor (YouTube).</p>
<p>Yet, in a develop specific to the Internet industry, unregulated vertical integration is widely embraced by conglomerates such as Google and Yahoo!. It is a logical conclusion, as cross-promotion (through the linking pin power role) creates a synergistic web audience (which equals advertising revenue) across Google owned (or controlled) distribution, exhibition and production organizations. For instance, one could search Google, click on a search result for a YouTube video, and consume a video produced by a firm financed Google’s $100 million investment in content production; all the while exposed to advertisements displayed by DoubleClick (owned by Google).</p>

<p>(2011, 12 April) Sirius And XM Allowed To Merge In Canada. <em>FMQB</em>. Retrieved from <a href="http://www.fmqb.com/article.asp?id=2159191">http://www.fmqb.com/article.asp?id=2159191</a></p>
<p>The CRTC (Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission allowing Canadian Satellite Radio Inc. to merge with Sirius Canada Inc. and renewed each of their one-year licenses. CSR is the XM affiliate in Canada. The CRTC claimed that the merger would &#8220;offer clear benefits to the Canadian broadcasting system and to Canadian consumers.&#8221;</p>
<p>The new company will be named Canadian Satellite Radio Holdings, , and its largest shareholders will be John Bitove, the owner of CSRI Inc., US-based Sirius XM, CBC/Radio Canada, and Slaight Communications.</p>
<p><span id="more-1116"></span>The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission is one of Canada&#8217;s authority power roles. Without its approval, the Canadian counterparts to XM and Sirius would not be able to merge, despite facing financial difficulties. The merge could apparently save the companies a combined $20 million over 18 months and allow them to combine their strengths to attract more subscribers.</p>
<p>&#8220;This decision will lead to the creation of a stronger combined  organization, better equipped to innovate and compete in the broader  audio entertainment marketplace,&#8221; said Mark Redmond, President &amp; CEO  of both Sirius Canada and the merged entity.  &#8220;We are pleased that the  CRTC recognized the clear benefits derived from this merger.  This is an  exciting time for Sirius|XM Canada, and we look forward to continuing  to offer a world-class entertainment experience for our current and  future subscribers.&#8221;</p>
<p>The merger is also good news for the satellite radio companies because they will no longer have to compete with each other for contracts with linking-pin companies&#8211;namely automotive companies. This merger may sound good to potential or current subscribers because it seems like the combined company will be able to offer more over a broader range of content. It may be true, however there is also the possibility of viewing this as a continuing trend of consolidation in the radio industry.</p>
<p>Just as the provisions in the Telecommunications Act of 1996 abolished limits on how many radio stations one company may own was followed by terrestrial radio consolidation, the two major satellite radio providers are now owned by only one company. On the other hand, this may give satellite radio a fighting chance at remaining an up-and-coming radio platform that has not yet realized its full, impressive potential.</p>
<p>Canada’s antitrust watchdog is the Competition Bureau. The CB approved the merger  in February, but certain  closing conditions remain. The merger is scheduled to close by June 2011.</p>

<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://echoesblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/grammy-logo-gold.jpg" alt="" width="140" height="178" />In a long-overdue decision, the <a href="http://www.grammy.org/recording-academy">Recording Academy</a> recently announced that it would consider video game music for <a href="http://www.grammy.com/">Grammy Awards</a>. Although video games won’t have their own category (yet), they’ll be included in a general category encompassing “Music for Visual Media.” Nobody in the general public cares about this, of course, but the interesting question is whether they should.</p>
<p><span id="more-1109"></span></p>
<p>It’s tempting to compare the Grammy Awards to MTV—sad stories of once-powerful facilitators that got an ear-boxing from cable and the Internet—but the power of the Grammy Awards to effectively promote music even during the network era is questionable. The event has always been a self-congratulatory party for an inside group of music industry people, and during a time when media choices were more limited, the public mainly just enjoyed basking in the pomp and circumstance of the networks’ glitzy coverage. In fact, a better analogy for the Grammys would be to an Independence Day parade, a once-family friendly event today attended mostly by old war vets as the younger crowd plugs into yet another interactive media platform.</p>
<p>The reality, however, is that the Grammy Awards aren&#8217;t really trying to facilitate interaction with that increasingly disinterested TV-viewing public. It’s aimed at those industry insiders, and that’s what makes the inclusion of video game music into the award categories so important. The Recording Academy may not have much direct power over audiences, but by facilitating interactions between industry creators and producers, it helps to determine what those audiences eventually hear online, in stores, and on the radio. Now it may help to determine what video gamers, probably the least likely subgroup of Americans to care about the Grammys, hear when they log into <em><a href="http://us.battle.net/wow/en/">World of Warcraft</a></em>.</p>
<p>The new rules formalize linking pin activities between the record companies and the video game industry that have been growing with the video game industry itself. Popular titles like <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> routinely license popular rock and heavy-metal songs that fit well within their violent and iconoclastic gaming environment. Now, as new game consoles like Wii <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/tech/gaming/2007-05-24-wii_N.htm">offer games for a wide variety of audience categories</a>—fitness games for kids and older adults, chess games for math prodigies—that expand video games far beyond their traditional teenage-male cult, the record companies are starting to work with the gaming companies to exploit all the new distribution and exhibition possibilities.</p>
<p>Why wouldn’t Sony, for example, create music just for a new video game aimed at a particular age group or gender? These days, online and console games probably have a larger audience than MTV or VH1, and they have the ability to reach at least as specialized an audience as a cable television network. Cross-platform releases that include video games, radio, and television will probably become increasingly common. It probably won’t be long before the major media conglomerates own most of the video game production firms as they seek to streamline production, distribution, and exhibition of music and other mass media materials.</p>
<p>Public advocates within the music and video game industries have wanted the Grammys to recognize video game music for years, especially since some Grammy-winning songs that eventually enjoyed popular release originated within video games. Traditional video gamers, however, should be very afraid. This is exactly what happened when <a href="http://www.viacom.com/Pages/default.aspx">Viacom</a> invaded MTV, and we all saw the results. Now that the Recording Academy is sticking its fingers into video games, the core teenage-male cult may start to witness even more commercialization and homogenization of the music in their once-underground medium. Video game music creators, once somewhat separate from the mainstream music industry and free to experiment in a way unknown at most of the modern corporate record labels, may now be pressured to tow the labels’ line.</p>
<p>Only time will tell how the relationship between the labels and the video game companies will develop. However, if the conglomerates’ past record with new media is any indication, the idiosyncratic array of music in many video games today may soon become an artifact of history.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fernandez, Jay A. (2011, April 14). Roundtable: the writers behind summer&#8217;s biggest blockbusters (exclusive video). <em>The Hollywood Reporter. </em>Retrieved from <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/risky-business/roundtable-writers-summers-biggest-blockbusters-177491">http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/risky-business/roundtable-writers-summers-biggest-blockbusters-177491</a><a href="http://mediaindustries11.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/04/2558435938_dc8097fd79.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1106" src="http://mediaindustries11.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/04/2558435938_dc8097fd79-300x260.jpg" alt="" width="184" height="111" /></a></p>
<p>With the summer fast approaching, the pressure on Hollywood screenwriters is beginning to mount. Summer blockbusters or &#8220;tentpoles&#8221;, while not necessarily containing the same topics or plotlines, tend to share a lot of the same elements. Much like the season itself, summer blockbusters are designed by filmmakers and marketed by studios to &#8220;make you cheer, make you gasp, and make you laugh,&#8221; according to Ehren Kruger, screenwriter of <em>Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, </em>in a Hollywood Reporter roundtable discussion with Hollywood screenwriters. These blockbusters are not typically designed to capture the attention of Oscar voters; instead, studios pour countless amounts of money into these films&#8217; budgets in order to regain profits and more. &#8220;These movies are greenlit now based on pre-visualized animated sequences that are the action sequences or moments that are really designed to wow the audience or stand out in a trailer,&#8221; said Kruger. Kruger&#8217;s quote exemplifies how summer blockbusters are designed first and foremost to appeal to a widespread audience. In order to accomplish this, studios look at past moneymakers and formulas that tend to appeal to the masses, and often design these summer blockbusters with these precedents in mind. Fundamentally, the studios are out to maximize profits when making these blockbusters. The main objective isn&#8217;t always necessarily making a film with quality of the highest caliber. Instead, money is what makes the industries continue churning out these massively-budgeted films year after year.<span id="more-1104"></span></p>
<p>When writing these films in the first place, Hollywood screenwriters face pressure to come up with &#8220;fresh&#8221; ideas that will capture the attention of audiences. Additionally, they must keep in mind how their films can function as collaborative efforts with other industries. Cross-promotion is one of the most effective and essential forms of spreading the word about a film and creating a successful summer blockbuster. Cross-promotion is essentially when consumers of one product are targeted, in a marketing sense, by the promotion of another product. Summer blockbusters are well-known in Hollywood as utilizing cross-promotion; as an example, animated films aimed at children are often promoted through toys in kids&#8217; meals at fast food restaurants like McDonald&#8217;s and Burger King.</p>
<p>Similarly, companies often pay studio substantial amounts of money to have their products featured in some way in a film they believe might be popular, a practice known as product placement. A notable example of this is when Hershey paid Steven Spielberg and Universal to feature Reeses&#8217; Pieces in the film <em>E.T.</em>, which paid off when <em>E.T. </em>became a global success. Both cross-promotion and product placement are considered linking pins with the film industry, as money can be made both promoting films and other products in other industries, such as fast food restaurants.</p>
<p>Two upcoming summer blockbusters will use both product placement and forms of cross-promotional merchandising in order to enhance the visibility of these films in the marketplace. The upcoming superhero film <em>Green Lantern</em> will feature a prominent use of product placement. In the film, the main character&#8217;s mode of transportation is a Chevy Volt, a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle that has only been on the market since December 2010. To accomplish this, Chevrolet struck a deal with Warner Bros., <em>Green Lantern</em>&#8216;s studio, to feature the car prominently. This is an example of two separate industries collaborating financially in a mutually beneficial effort.</p>
<p>In terms of cross-promotion, DreamWorks&#8217; upcoming animated sequel <em>Kung Fu Panda 2 </em>will feature plush toys found in McDonalds&#8217; Happy Meals. In the <em>Hollywood Reporter</em> roundtable, the film&#8217;s screenwriter Jonathan Aibel said, &#8220;There&#8217;s nothing wrong with advertising as long as you feel like you&#8217;re not selling out your characters too much and you&#8217;re still being true to them.&#8221; This is likely a common mindset among the various people involved with making and advertising summer blockbusters. While the actual quality of these summer blockbusters is often hit or miss and/or up for debate, the fact remains that producers in the film industry have their eye on financial success. Above all else, the film industry is a business, and people involved with making these summer blockbusters want to make money.</p>

<p>Internet radio, such as Pandora, used with linking pin power roles such as the smartphone mobile industry, was recently subpoenaed by the government on the terms of illegal distribution of personal information.  When a user logs into an internet related radio site on their smartphone, their private information is given to that certain company to be distributed to their client power role, the advertisers.  Using Pandora, (although other internet related radio websites have been included in this court hearing) a federal grand jury served this subpoena in order to justify that these services disclose users personal information such as telephone number, gender, personal interests, and other information, illegally.</p>

<p>Not only are the internet radio sites being reevaluated for their privacy terms, but most of the internet is also, involving the internet power role.  In a Washington post article, the associated press tells that the Federal Trades Commission is now wanting to post a &#8220;Do Not Track&#8221; option for internet users.  The federal grand jury investigation is prominent on declining Pandora&#8217;s ability to access users information from their smartphone accounts.  Having advertisers as client power roles, Pandora released the private information to third parties for these advertisers to see the demographics and the amount of users on their site.  &#8220;Pandora said it shared information with third parties to help it track how users interact with the service and to deliver targeted advertising. But the company, based in Oakland, Calif., said it was “not a specific target” of the grand jury investigation.&#8221; (NYtimes.com)</p>
<p>Because internet radio is an enormous distributor and exhibitor power role, it will be extremely hard to shut it down; along with all the other cloud-based radio stations.  But having the &#8220;Do Not Track&#8221; option on their website will definitely create a boundary when it comes to gathering information for targeting their audiences for their paying advertisers.  &#8220;In its filing, Pandora said that a government Do Not Track mandate &#8216;could significantly hinder our ability to collect and use data relating to listeners&#8217; &#8220;(NYtimes.com).</p>
