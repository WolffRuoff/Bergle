								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Although now traditional education is the mainstream, do you think this situation will change in the future? With the progress of the technology and science, online education, which is more convenience and selectivity than traditional education, appears and spreads. “The number of student taking at least one online course has now surpassed 7.1 million and represents 33% (21.3million) of all higher education students.” (Allen&amp; Seaman, 2013) As we all know, traditional education is defined as teacher-centered delivery of instruction to classes of students who are the receivers of information. But what’s online education meant, is it effective to take the online education class?</p>
<p>Online education can also call distance education which refers to educational processes in which teachers and students are separated in space and time and communicate with each other mainly asynchronously. And this means convenience and flexible. For example, we don’t need to waste time on the way to class; we don’t have to go out during winter; we can decide the class time more flexible. Also, it’s impossible for us to find all kinds of courses in one place, no matter top university or educational institution. But in online education, courses are variety and concentrated. If online education has so many benefits, why the mainstream is still the traditional education? “Conversely, researchers who critique online education mention the dissociative process that can accompany virtual learning environments, and acknowledge a disconnect in the instructor and student relationship, as well as in the ability to build a learning community.”(Sasha, A&amp; Reese, 2015) Indeed, imparting knowledge is not the only part important in the education. Face-to-face education likes the college, will also help students improve their social ability which is important for their social life in the future. Also many people think the traditional education is more authority and profession than the online education.</p>
<p>Though we can see both the shortcomings and advantages of the online education, from the data we can still know the number of people taking online classes keeps on increasing. “The current educational trend toward the development of 21st century skills has made online learning attractive to both basic and tertiary education.” (Sasha, A&amp; Reese, 2015) But what about the future, can online education replace the traditional education and become the mainstream, or the online education will never catch up with traditional education?</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Social media has impacted almost all aspects of our lives in one way or another. It changes the way people receive news, travel places, make purchases, communicate, the list goes on and on. Today I am going to focus on social medias impact on businesses. After reading pages 1-25 of Brand Buzz in the Echoverse by K. Hewett, W. Rand, R. Rust and H. Heerde, I have a much deeper knowledge on this topic. Businesses are now realizing that they must take advantage of all of their possible communication tools and a big one, especially in this generation is social media.  Through social media, much can be accomplished and in much faster, precise ways. Social media is a platform that allows a single individual or company to reach millions in seconds by blogging or tweeting  and whatnot. When businesses have news to share or prices to reveal, social media is the ideal place for them to post about it and have it reach millions of possible customers. Almost everyday as I go through my twitter feed,  I will find advertisements for the &#8220;hottest new cloths&#8221; or &#8220;the best deal around&#8221;. These companies are using twitter as  a place to advertise that was not available before. Social media is also important for businesses when it comes to damage control. Bad news travels fast and sometimes it can spell the end of a businesses success. One way that companies are able to contain bad news or in most cases cut their losses is to stay on top of it on social media. Company tweets have been proven to improve bad situations, the more tweets posted by them, results in less negative tweets by other people. Twitter can be so effective in this way as a result of the changing way people receive their news. Social media is a growing factor in the news industry and it has become increasingly clear that people are going through sites like Twitter to find news and information that they would have normally found elsewhere. Compared to the radio, televisions, newspaper and others, social media is faster, more personalized and more accessible. Not all social media sites are equivalent when referring to businesses needs. Twitter has been found to contain more of the information and news sharing as apposed to Facebook which is more personal information and communication. Social media has changed the way businesses operate in many ways, it can help companies with advertisement to crowd control and that will help any business succeed.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Digital Natives  was coined by Mark Prensky in 2001 (Vodanovich, Sudaram, Myers, 2010). “It is more specifically defined as those who have grown up in a  world where the use of information and communications technology is pervasive, ubiquitous and where information and communication technologies are used in an organizational and non organizational context” (Vodanovich, Sudaram, Myers, 2010). I have always found the topic of digital natives to be incredibly fascinating. The reason for this is because last year I started babysitting three boys that lived next door to me. I remember thinking to myself the task was going to be incredibly difficult because of the level of activity required to babysit three little boys. To my surprise it was actually incredibly easy. All they wanted to do was play on their I-pads. When I was younger I was constantly outside and I am considered to be a digital native. Now with the younger generation they are even more involved with technology than I was. In a way I found it sad that because their lives are so immersed with technology they may never understand the things that I came to love in my childhood. This leads me to think what are some of the things I missed out on in my childhood.</p>
<p>“Digital immigrants were not born into the digital world; rather they have learnt to engage with it in their adult lives” (Vodanovich, Sudaram, Myers, 2010). The major difference between the two is that digital natives were moulded by technology from a very young age. Digital Immigrants were people who later in life were immersed in the technology culture (Vodanovich, Sudaram, Myers, 2010). The skill set of the two can be completely different because of this. For example most digital immigrants are more comfortable with face to face communication or talking on the phone with someone then digital natives are (Vodanovich, Sudaram, Myers, 2010). This means that it is fair to assume that digital immigrants have better social skills than digital natives. Digital natives however are seen as more tech savvy then most adults. For example my five year old cousin is a lot better at using an I-pad than my Dad will ever be. I also found out from personal experience that digital immigrants seem to be more satisfied with the technology they have rather than yearning for the next best thing. My brother, sister and I always want the new phone coming out. However, my Mom and Dad still have the I-phone four and do not want to get a new upgrade. I think this goes back to the way technology has moulded us. We grew up in a generation were technology was constantly evolving and the next best thing was always considered the best. On the contrary my parents grew up without the same technology and do not value its importance as much as we do.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="control-box-wrapper">
<p>            The proliferation of new technology has brought to the national forefront a new form of bullying. Unlike traditional bullying, cyberbullying is a more insidious, prevalent and difficult to trace form of abuse and the number of cyberbullying incidents seem to be growing in epidemic proportions. With the burgeoning advancements in technology, people now have the ability to instantaneously communicate with others through various technological mediums&#8211;internet, text messaging, social networks, and video games. Consequently, this provides multiple forums for disseminating information and an outlet for hurling anonymous insults and harassing comments. Is there not a way to combat cyberbullying? So far, the answer seems to be no.  No one seems to be shielded from its reach.</p>
<p>Brittan Heller, the Anti-Defamation League’s first director of technology and society discusses her own personal experience, as well as, others experiences with cyberbullying in a recent article in the New York Times titled “What It’s Like to fight Online Hate” (2016). Heller, a Jewish American woman, was flooded with sexist anti-Semitic comments on her Twitter account just moments after the A.D.L announced her hire in early September. She understood that cyberbullying was prevalent in our environment today, but even she was amazed and troubled with the speed and maliciousness in which these attacks were made. Everywhere she turned she was confronted with images of swastikas taunting her about her Jewish heritage and death threats all because she was appointed to this incredibly prestigious position.</p>
<p>The mental and emotionally consequences suffered by countless numbers of cyberbullying victims are resulting long lasting effects. In today’s age technology allows a tormentor to go where bullies where afraid to go in the past. A crisis exists and it needs to be stopped.  If nothing is done soon, increasingly more and more people will be directly affected by this everyday creating a culture where you are forced to conceal your true feelings for fear of public scrutiny, ridicule and humiliation.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do you remember when people would talk face to face, make plans by asking another person if they had plans over the weekend, and interact in ways that did not include digital technology? Personally I do not remember, because I am a digital native and was essentially born with an iPhone in my right hand. Growing up in a society where technology was constantly changing, it was easy for me to adapt to the latest form of technology because I was surrounded by transforming technology, and in order to survive and do well in the society I was growing up in, I had to get used to the use of digital electronics. At a young age, I had learned to speak with people and feel comfortable interacting with others in face-to-face circumstances, but with the development of social media, email, instant messaging and texting, I knew that it was not going to be long before technology took over the world of communication.</p>
<p>I started using social media as a way to communicate with my peers in middle school. Since nobody had a cell phone, we would use email to send each other instant messages, mapping out our weekend plans, and where we would go after school. Not long after that, my friends and I would text each other, as it was easy to send a quick message and then go back to what you were doing. Before I could realize, the way that I communicated with others was permanently changed. I felt myself constantly checking my cell phone for any new text messages, repeatedly checking Facebook to see if any of my friends had posted a new status update. “Let’s use our imagination a bit. If the internet, mobile devices, and games were taken away from us, how would we feel? I know many of us would feel like a part of our life is missing due to technology now being a necessity in our everyday life.” When I did not have my phone on me, or I was not using a source of social media, I felt naked, disconnected, and as if I was missing out, and still feel that way today when I do not carry around my cell phone with me.</p>
<p>I have recognized over time that technology has taken away valuable communication skills from me, and that it is more difficult to hold a conversation with somebody for an extended period of time without checking my phone for new notifications. I also find myself preferring to make plans over text, rather than face-to-face communications. I have also realized that it is more difficult for myself and others to be as social and outgoing as we can potentially be because we are too dependent upon technology. Moving forward I plan on depending less on technology not because I am too dependent, but because it is affecting me as an individual and holding me back from reaching my full potential as a person.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is a fine line between fair use and copyright infringement, especially when it comes to YouTube content. According to Rich Stim, fair use is defined as “any copying of copyrighted material done for a limited and ‘transformative’ purpose, such as to comment upon, criticize, or parody a copyrighted work. Such uses can be done without permission from the copyright owner” (Stim, 2013). With traditional media, discerning what is fair use and what is not may be easier, but the problem has been exacerbated with the introduction of digital media.  On YouTube, “many uploaders do not [address copyright issues] and simply recycle and share copyrighted media with seeming impunity,” while many claim fair use and are still sued regardless (Collins, 2014). The system that YouTube uses to catch copyrighted material is called Content ID, and some claim it is too sensitive. Collins gives many examples of users who used copyrighted material, but claimed fair use in the video’s description, which Content ID does not detect. There are also people who are unaware of fair use and how it could work to their benefit, myself included. For one of my college applications, I needed to submit a dance portfolio via YouTube. One of my background songs got flagged for copyright and I had to find an alternate way to send in my application. I could have claimed fair use, but it would have been extremely difficult to get the video back on YouTube because of how strict these copyright rules can be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I feel that as long as credit is given in the video description, there should be no reason to flag content for copyright. It can be argued that copyright holders putting restrictions on YouTube users will limit creation online. Many artists use others’ work as a starting point for theirs, whether that means making a remix or a parody of the original work. If YouTube’s Content ID continues to be this strict less people will continue to upload to YouTube, possibly leading to a change in the digital space. The types of videos uploaded to YouTube may change and hopefully our online culture is not altered as a result.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The motives found for posting on Instagram are surveillance/knowledge about others, documentation, and coolness. According to &#8220;Instagram: Motives for its use and relationship to narcissism and contextual age&#8221;, of the motives “Surveillance/Knowledge about others” was the most influential reason behind Instagram use&#8221; (Sheldon and Bryant). I myself use Instagram often for knowledge about others and have noticed that my peers also do. I catch myself scrolling aimlessly just to keep updated and see what&#8217;s up with the people I follow on my account. Or I can even keep up with strangers that are not private and I go to the explore page. I can see what they are doing/have done.</p>
<p>The knowledge about others also included the following and &#8220;liking&#8221; of people&#8217;s posts. Several facts about someone can be figured out through their Instagram. This information ranges from someones economic status, relationship status, the amount of friends they have, and along with that who their closest friends are, etc. My friends and I all post a lot on Instagram and a lot about us can be discovered due to what we post. This information is only viewed by our followers, but if someone is not private, anyone can follow them or just view their posts without following them. that means complete strangers form the other side of the world can see what they have been doing in their life.</p>
<p>The next motive was &#8220;Documentation&#8221;. The authors write, &#8220;The reasoning behind Documentation surfacing as a potential motive in this study is likely due to the characteristics of Instagram that set it apart from other social media forums. For instance, Instagram primarily focuses on images or pictures whereas Twitter is a more text-based forum&#8221; (Sheldon and Bryant). People like to document their lives through photos, which makes it more likely for them to post a photo to Instagram rather than composing a tweet. Another good point mentioned in this article is that &#8220;Instagram allows users to provide both a picture and text as there is an option to provide a caption underneath the image. In this way, Instagram acts as a kind of virtual photo album for many people&#8221; (Sheldon and Bryant).</p>
<p>Lastly, there is &#8220;Coolness&#8221;. When it comes to social media people usually want to be on one that is popular among their peers. There are also &#8220;cool&#8221; features on Instagram like filters, links to things that are trending, and ways to explore. Along with these cool features people like to use this social media because of self-promotion and to become more popular. Everyone wants to get a lot of &#8220;likes&#8221; on their photos to show that they are cool and popular.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">                          The article, <em>Fashion in the Age of Advertising</em>, talks about the progression of fashion through advancements in technology and how our views and perceptions have changed. Being “trendy” or wearing popular clothes is instigated by the common use of technology. Using the internet allows people to constantly see what others are wearing and how they are doing their makeup. As soon as New York Fashion Week happens, people are flocking to the stores to get the styles that were worn in the show as they have seen pictures posted online. However, this also instigates the need for material items. When people see that hunter rain boots are in style, they feel the need to spend $100 plus dollars on them to fit in. When picking out clothing in the morning, you  strategically plan out how you want to look to the world. However, the nature of advertising online has changed the access people have to the information regarding the latest styles. Therefore people are more concerned with keeping up with the latest trends than expressing their personality through their style. In </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Fashion in the Age of Advertising</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, Martin states, “The consumer desire for fashion and beauty is one that can be compelled to fast fulfillment and vast urgings.” (1995) With the constantly changing trends and easy access to these changes allows consumers to constantly buy the latest and greatest products. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">                            I know I personally fall victim to online advertisements. As soon as I see an ad for a cute pair of boots, my immediate reaction is go google search those boots. Societal norms makes us want to fit in because we feel as though we are an insider. Therefore, buying the latest trends gives us the satisfaction of fitting in with the norms of society. We can be just like everybody else and for a teenager that is all we want. Many people use the saying sometimes fashion is painful. This rings true in many sense. People are no longer wearing clothing for purely function, it is also about fitting in and looking “cool”. Wearing five inch heels are not very comfortable; however, society tells us that is what we need to wear to be “normal.”It is hard to keep up with the latest trends as it is very costly. Therefore, many times advertisements leave us yearning for material items that often  we don&#8217;t need.  Seeing other people with these items like our friends or celebrities on the T.V. makes us jealous and gives the feeling that we need these items. Will fashion change directions or will the norms they advertise become less and less achievable for the average person? </span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Everywhere we look, we are bombarded by advertisements. Even when we don&#8217;t notice, we constantly have celebrities and people we look up to shoving products, services, and ideas down our throat. What we don&#8217;t seem to think about is the effect that all of this advertising has on on, especially when it comes from social media.</p>
<p>Check for yourself; go onto either Instagram, Facebook, or YouTube, and scroll until you see someone advertise something on their page. Usually, this person is someone who is well liked and has thousands, if not millions of followers. They claim that they love a specific product and that they absolutely cannot live without it, or that a service has helped them turn their life around. Unfortunately for us, this is almost never the case. No, Selena Gomez probably doesn&#8217;t use Pantene to wash her hair, while Kylie Jenner probably doesn&#8217;t use the makeup products she endorses every day.</p>
<p>&#8220;But as more <strong>celebrities</strong>, from Kim Kardashian to Bravo&#8217;s &#8220;Real Housewives,&#8221; are being paid to tweet about <strong>endorsements</strong> and at public appearances on behalf of brands, more marketers are writing <strong>social</strong>&#8211;<strong>media</strong> guarantees into their contracts. &#8220;We&#8217;re starting to hear in negotiations, &#8216;We&#8217;d like to include X number of tweets or Facebook postings,'&#8221; said Peter Hess, co-head of commercial <strong>endorsements</strong> for Creative Artists Agency. &#8220;It&#8217;s similar to traditional advertising-instead of two commercials, now we want two tweets.&#8221; (Hampp, 1). The reality is that celebrity endorsements and advertising are very misleading. The people who endorse these products get paid a lot of money for posting a picture with the product for their millions of followers to see, and then buy.</p>
<p>The reason celebrity endorsement on social media is such an issue is that there are young people who are not educated on the topic and <em>will </em>give in to the tricks of companies and go ahead and buy these things. They look at celebrities as role models, and want everything they have even though it is not used by the person endorsing it. This brings us back to the idea of who controls your digital world? Will society let things like tons of followers on social media be the reason why they will buy certain products? Only we can be the answer to that question.</p>
