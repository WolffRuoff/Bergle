								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-131" src="http://mediacom.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2009/09/9137_TVNM_72ppiRGB_150pixw.jpg" alt="9137_TVNM_72ppiRGB_150pixw" width="150" height="225" />In her new article titled &#8220;As Easy As Pie: Cooking Shows, Domestic Efficiency and Postfeminist Temporality&#8221; that was published in the July issue of <em>Television and New Media</em>, Dr. Elizabeth Nathanson examines depictions of everyday life in contemporary popular and consumer culture. Through analysis of the Food Network television program <em>30 Minute Meals</em>, Dr. Nathanson argues that cooking shows both reveal and construct panics about the nature of women&#8217;s domestic lives in the postfeminist context. As her abstract explains:</p>
<p>This article examines how the media define women’s experience of time in the postfeminist context through analysis of the popular Food Network program <em>30 Minute Meals</em>. In a context in which women attempt to “have it all,” the media expose anxieties about and offer solutions for how women should balance home and work demands. Contemporary representations of domesticity on television present the home as radically affected by the temporal logic of the working world. By interrogating <em>30 Minute Meals</em>’ real-time narrative structure alongside the marketing strategies of stores like Crate and Barrel, this article argues that postfeminist media propose contradictory remedies to the contemporary “time-crunch” in the form of rational and efficient time management and nostalgia for an imagined past in which women had endless amounts of time. Studying how the media represents women’s time is crucial to understanding definitions of femininity, women’s labor and leisure in the postfeminist context.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Professor Sue Curry Jansen&#8217;s research has long been concerned with the relationship between media and democracy.  In her most recent article, &#8220;Phantom Conflict: Lippmann, Dewey and the Fate of the Public,&#8221; published this month in <em>Communication and Critical Cultural Studies, </em>Dr. Jansen brings historical analysis to bear on a deeply misunderstood but dominant view of the intellectual legacies of John Dewey and Walter Lippmann.  In her abstract, Jansen explains:</p>
<p><span style="font-family:tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;line-height:normal"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-73" src="http://mediaandcommunication.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/rccc.jpg" alt="RCCC" width="211" height="300" />Contrary to the prevailing view in media and cultural studies, philosopher John Dewey and journalist Walter Lippmann did not represent different schools of thought. They were not adversaries in a great public debate about the fate of the public in modern democracies in the 1920s. Rather, their exchange about the “phantom” public was reframed as a conflict in the early 1980s, a reframing which has achieved broad interdisciplinary acceptance even though its rests on a casual rhetorical trope, not historical documentation. The reframing provides a salutary but inaccurate origin story for American media and cultural studies, illustrates the hazards of relying on secondary interpretations of historical sources, and deflects attention away from realistic assessment of the problems confronting democracy today. Dismantling this disciplinary folklore is essential to the integrity of the emerging “new history” of media and communication.</span></p>

The conference, titled <a href="http://depts.washington.edu/chid/Program.php">&#8220;States of Violence: Representations of Conflict in the Film, Fiction, and Media of South Asia&#8221;</a> was hosted by the university&#8217;s <a href="http://depts.washington.edu/chid/clowescenter.php">Clowes Centre for Conflict and Dialogue</a>.</p>
<p>Dr. McEwan&#8217;s paper was on &#8220;Modes of Violence in the films of Ram Gopal Varma.&#8221; Varma is a director in Mumbai known for his gangster films set in the Mumbai underworld, and the paper explores the ways in which Varma&#8217;s films attempt to blend &#8220;Bollywood&#8221; conventions with genre elements borrowed from Hollywood and Hong Kong films.</p>

<p>Like many students at Muhlenberg, Eirinn Disbrow and Avivah Furman wanted to volunteer to make their world a better place. They quickly realized however, that making a difference was much more difficult than they had thought. Undeterred, they decided to make a documentary about the challenges of volunteerism. The resulting feature, <em>Good Intentions,</em> debuted this past Friday at Muhlenberg&#8217;s Recital Hall.</p>
<p>Supported by a competitive summer research grant from Muhlenberg, Disbrow and Furman joined a group of American students who signed up to volunteer in Costa Rica. They documented their own experiences and those of their colleagues, focusing on the students&#8217; eagerness and occasional naivete. The film, completed with assistance from a number of Media &amp; Comm faculty,  is a compelling account of the challenges that stand between good intentions and successful results.</p>
<p>Disbrow is a Media &amp; Communication major and Creative Writing minor from Wilton, CT. Furman is a Media &amp; Communication and Film Studies major from Hastings-on-Hudson, NY. Both are juniors.</p>
