As he displays again in this entertaining and illuminating look at how we make snap judgments-about people&#8217;s intentions, the authenticity of a work of art, even military strategy-he can parse for general readers the intricacies of fascinating but little-known fields like professional food tasting (why does Coke taste different from Pepsi?). Gladwell&#8217;s conclusion, after studying how people make instant decisions in a wide range of fields from psychology to police work, is that we can make better instant judgments by training our mind and senses to focus on the most relevant facts-and that less input (as long as it&#8217;s the right input) is better than more.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><em><strong>Infomaniac Tip<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The Living Room Candidate (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.livingroomcandidate.org\/\">http:\/\/www.livingroomcandidate.org\/<\/a>), from the Museum of the Moving Image, presents over 300 commercials from every presidential election since 1952. From the site:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;In a media-saturated environment in which news, opinions, and entertainment surround us all day on our television sets, computers, and cell phones, the television commercial remains the one area where presidential candidates have complete control over their images. Television commercials use all the tools of fiction filmmaking, including script, visuals, editing, and performance, to distill a candidate&#8217;s major campaign themes into a few powerful images. Ads elicit emotional reactions, inspiring support for a candidate or raising doubts about his opponent. While commercials reflect the styles and techniques of the times in which they were made, the fundamental strategies and messages have tended to remain the same over the years.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Browse commercials by election year, type of commercial (e.g., biographical, children, commander in chief, fear), issue (e.g., change, civil rights, taxes, war).<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Calendar of Events\u00a0<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>10\/22<\/strong>\u00a0Meditation.
