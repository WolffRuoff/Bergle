								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Unfortunately, too many people often find themselves unable to find a job in a career they wanted to pursue or find themselves pondering if they’re truly passionate about what they received their degree in. These are frustrating dilemmas to face. Luckily, there are options available for students wishing to change their career path or gain additional skills to better aid them for the career they want.</p>
<p>While the job hunt may feel suffocating, there are many careers paths that have seen significant growth over the course of the last decade which are continuing to thrive in today’s economy. If you’re looking for a career change, the following paths may be worth the investment.</p>

<p><strong>Office clerk</strong> jobs are projected to by nearly 489,500 jobs, increasing the need for financial and accounting education.</p>
<p>The need for <strong>postsecondary teachers</strong> is expected to balloon by 305,700 positions by 2020, which requires detailed education in all subject areas.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/fastest-growing.htm">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>, careers opportunities in technology and finance are expected to increase notably from 2016 to 2026, offering quality salaries to workers in both fields.</p>
<p>Careers in computer science and information technology are growing rapidly, as the bureau expects opportunities as <strong>software developers</strong> and <strong>computer applications developers</strong> to increase by to go up 31 percent by 2026.</p>
<p>Also expected to increase is the need for <strong>mathematicians</strong>, which the bureau projects to increase by 30 percent in the ten-year time span.
