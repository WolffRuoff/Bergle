								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How much do we own of what we post online? The photos that I post online are mine, but they can be anyone&#8217;s. Someone can easily screenshot my photo and then they also &#8220;own&#8221; that photo. I have privacy settings so that only my followers that I approve can see my photos but some people are public which means anyone can see their posts. That makes it easier for others that they do not know to then &#8220;own&#8221; their photos. These photos are not tangible. I do not have them printed out I only have them online so if something happens to my accounts or my laptop, I no longer have those photos.</p>
<p>On social media, teenagers take how many likes they get on a photo very seriously. Now a day it is also a big deal how many comments one gets. The commenting on photos is for your friends, but also in a way for yourself to cement that relationship to others. Getting a lot of likes and comments on a photo usually shows that someone is good looking and popular. But that does not mean that someone that does not get as many likes is not popular and good looking. There are other factors that go into getting a lot of likes. For example someone with one thousand followers will get more likes than someone with five hundred followers because more people are exposed to their photo. A lot of thought is put in to posting a photo on Instagram (especially with girls). Then there is a lot less thought put into what photos are posted on Facebook because the likes and comments are not nearly as valued. It is more of an online photo album for themselves and their friends.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This infographic explains the makeup  of the Instagram audience and their uses of this platform through numerical values. The most Instagram users are from urban settings (42%).  (Hutchinson, 2016)</span> <span style="font-weight: 400">This correlates with the idea that wealthier people use the app more. For example, only 26% of users make an annual income of less than $30,000 ;however, 30% of users have an income between $50,000 and $74,000. (Hutchinson, 2016) Living in a more urban setting is more expensive. From personal experience, Instagram is a difficult social media because it is all about having the perfect picture to get the most likes. One needs to make sure they are consistently posting  on their feed so they please their followers. Living in a more urban setting with some more money makes it easier for people to take pictures of their dinners when they go out to eat or a picture of their friends on their shopping excursion. People feel the need to show off their lives and make it more glamorous to their followers. Looking at the idea of filters and photoshop, one can see that followers can easily be alluded by a post. A mediocre selfie can turn into a work of art with a simple filter. When talking about having a fake identity in class discussions, most students said they don&#8217;t post inauthentic stuff but they don&#8217;t post the ugly or bad pictures. Only showing 50% of your life is inauthentic because from the viewer&#8217;s perspective, your life is perfect.  800 million posts are tagged with love, showing people&#8217;s’ needs to present their best sides and their amazing love life. (Hutchinson, 2016) Although relationships are difficult, followers are only subject to the fun outings and memorable couple moments. Therefore, Instagram often falsely shows a life of fun and luxury. Overall this infographic does a good job using numbers to show how Instagram is an app used for appeal and attention. However it doesn&#8217;t show the entire picture. Who was polled and how do we know these statistics aren&#8217;t biased in any way? </span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span lang="EN-US">In today’s internet community, not only famous people, but also normal people can be seen by the public through search engines or some social media. And the thing we should do first in this open community is to try to know what other people see through my social media accounts. So I use an afternoon to pretend I am a stranger and searching information through Google to try to know a person named JiahuiHuang. First of all, I entered the name JiahuiHuang in the Google engine to see if something shows. But the result really disappointed me, no matter if I click on ALL, Images, or Videos, the only place I can find myself is the LinkedIn—I am the eighteenth in line. To have a more accurate result, I also tried to search my information from other search engines like Bing and DuckDuckGo, though the messages they showed are different, I can’t find more information about myself. I started to think if my mother tongue is not English, and I stayed in a country that speak Chinese in my past eighteen years that would influence the result. So I searched my information in Google again, but this time in Chinese. Again, I found nothing, because so many people in China are named JiahuiHuang and I am not famous. Then I added some key words during the searching like my primary school. Excellent, I finally found a few things about myself during this searching—some writings that were awarded and some other award certificates at my primary school, and no more can be found.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Why do I have so little information in the internet? Few reasons</span><span lang="EN-US">: </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">1. I am not famous</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">2. I am not a person who is outstanding—famous in a particular field, won some special award or had some special achievements.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">3. I am kind of a person that out of the online social community, I post nothing and sometimes I use a pseudonym in some social media such as Facebook and Instagram.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Is it a great thing that others will have a hard time to find my real information through the network? From a security and privacy perspective, yes! But in my heart, I will feel uncomfortable that others can’t find something about me, because this proves I am not an outstanding person. In the future, though I will still not post something about myself, I hope others can find more about me through searching in Google. And what I hope to be seen in the future network in five years is something like this: JiahuiHuang, an outstanding student who used to study in Muhlenberg; Stanford student, JiahuiHuang, assists the professor in the important study of a subject; JiahuiHuang, reports an essay in a scientific magazine… </span></p>

Interestingly, each time I did it was it was with the expectation of hoping to see some stats about a sporting event I recently played in. I expected to read about my sports accomplishments.<span id="yiv2340228953yui_3_16_0_1_1476194798227_2670">  </span>Candidly speaking, I was focused on simply being mentioned since with each published stat my popularity rose amongst my peers and in sports circles.<span id="yiv2340228953yui_3_16_0_1_1476194798227_2671">  </span>With each new sporting event came more name recognition, photos and videos. In all candor, I never really paid much attention to the details. <span id="yiv2340228953yui_3_16_0_1_1476194798227_2672"> </span>Instead, my focus was seeing my stats in print for all to see and the sport’s action photos that usually accompanied the posts.<span id="yiv2340228953yui_3_16_0_1_1476194798227_2673">  </span>I didn’t expect to find anything else—sports is who I am.</div>

Admittedly, each new post helped fuel my self-confidence, motivation and competitive edge. The posts provided positive reinforcement for me and I sough them out. Yes, there was a site here or there that talked about other things such as scholarships received or community projects but for the most part is was all about sports. <span id="yiv2340228953yui_3_16_0_1_1476194798227_2678"> </span>I have managed to keep my private live just that –private&#8211;and I hope to keep it that way. Naturally, there would be exceptions for certain milestones and events that could help me achieve certain goals or are worthy of sharing because of the positive values they evoke and inspire. <span id="yiv2340228953yui_3_16_0_1_1476194798227_2679"> </span></div>

Recognition for community service projects, work accomplishments and promotions, travel experiences and positive news about my development as a person is what I hope they read about me</span></div>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is not the first time I have googled myself; I have done it a few times in the past just for fun, so I could predict many of the results this time around. I searched on Google, Bing, and DuckDuckGo, and the first results were a fitness model named Heather Downey. I received similar results for the images: magazine covers and photoshoots of this model. On Google under the “All” section, it took three pages until I found something related to me; it was the YouTube video I submitted to Princeton as a supplement for my application. Although the application is no longer valid, I keep that video online because it serves as a dance reel of what I did in high school. Even in my intro, I am extremely professional, and the video is not something I am ashamed of. I went through page ten of these results and the video was the only thing I found that related to the Heather Downey I know.</p>
<p>Under the images, it took a few scrolls of the mouse to find a picture of me, which is my senior portrait. It is posted on my home dance studio’s website, where are all the recent graduates are showcased. My dance studio is a place that I am proud to put my name to, and I would recommend it to anyone looking to take dance in the area. The next picture I found was one on my high school’s website from the Senior Citizen Brunch, where my culinary arts class made treats for the senior citizens who live in the town. I was interviewed for the neighborhood paper, where I described the food we made. I actually forgot this existed online, but I’m happy it’s there because it represents how active I was in community service while in high school. The only other picture I found was a picture of me standing in front of a classroom. In my junior year of high school, I participated in a French poetry contest. This was an event that really pushed me out of my comfort zone, and although I didn’t win anything, I am proud that I was able to go.</p>
<p>Bing and DuckDuckGo had even less information, and it took even longer to find myself. I’m not sure whether it is a good thing or not that I am not extremely accessible online. What I could find was information that I am fine with being online, but it makes me wonder if the other Heather Downeys of the world are affecting my reputation. In my search, I found mugshots and criminal records for one Heather Downey, but I also found a Heather Downey who is a life coach and has an inspirational website. If future employers were to google me, they would not find me, but what would they think of the people who share my name?</p>
<p>I think everyone should Google themselves every once in a while. Information changes and is passed around quickly, and although your digital presence may be good right now, it could change with one article or photo. I will make googling myself a habit, especially since I will be moving into the workforce in the coming years.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The book </span><span class="s2">the App Generation</span><span class="s1"> by Howard Gardner and Katie Davis describes the complexities of the technology associated with our generation today. One main point of the excerpt was that the apps a person downloads can be completely different than other people in their generation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>However, all the apps are downloaded with the same intention. This intention is to portray an ideal self image. The article even describes apps and social media as “ identity playgrounds“ (Gardner &amp; Davis ,2014).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>People today would rather spend their time making it look like their having fun than actually trying to have fun. “On Facebook people are more concerned with making it look like they’re living<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>rather than actually living” (Gardner &amp; Davis ,2014).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> What I found interesting in the book was that there was not only an emphasis on digital impressions. There was<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>also an emphasis on the characteristics of the app generation as well. One character trait was narcissism. Teens in the app generation are narcissistic in their appearances because they get constant reassurances from how many likes on Facebook they get. However in real life they are afraid to take risks because in life there is no like button. One point that I find extremely relevant to today’s society is that we do not take enough reflection time. We are constantly on our phones looking at comment sections or texting people that we don&#8217;t have time to formulate our own opinions. Standardized tests are so structured today that they are more about filling in the right bubble then the formulation of opinions on the topic. Teens need someone to emulate if they can’t formulate opinions themselves. This is why they emulate celebrities and famous people on social media. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> I think that it is fascinating that in previous article read in class , As we may think, people were predicting and looking forward to future technology (Bush, 1945). What I am always curious about is even though they could predict the technologies that were going to be made in the future, could they predict the way that it would effect our generation? I also wonder if even people in the early stages of technology could predict the way technology would affect us today. This also makes me wonder how future technology will have affected the generations in the future.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I got a Facebook when I was 12, I was ecstatic because it was my first time using social media. I didn&#8217;t create an account to truly expose my identity, however. I just sought to communicate with my friends and acquaintances. In 7th grade, there was a trend with the girls in my school to change your last name on Facebook to the last name of your favorite male singer. Pretty soon I was no longer Sarah Kremen; I was Sarah Bublé, a 13-year-old with a Michael Bublé obsession. It was also a trend to be &#8220;in a relationship&#8221; with one of your best friends to make it seem like you weren&#8217;t single. To this day, I am still &#8220;married&#8221; to my best friend Naomi. It&#8217;s been so for 5 years.</p>
<p>It turns out, this trend wasn&#8217;t just a trend for teenagers at South Side Middle School. In <em>It&#8217;s Complicated : The Social Lives of Networked Teens </em>by Danah Boyd, social media is a toss-up because while some teens feel the need to take it seriously and make their profile as accurate as possible to depict who they truly are, others find &#8220;playful ways&#8221; to &#8220;respond to social media sites&#8217; requests for information&#8221; (Boyd 33). An example of a &#8220;playful way&#8221; according to the text is how teens like to make their best friends their &#8220;siblings&#8221; on Facebook to show how close they are. I can relate to this because on my Facebook it says I have 6 sisters, even though I only have 1.</p>
<p>Though it is funny to fabricate information on social media, doesn&#8217;t it defeat the purpose of social media? Now that I&#8217;m no longer 13, I depend on Facebook for providing accurate information about people when I go on their profiles. For example, after I came across my roommate&#8217;s profile for the first time, I assumed that everything she established about herself was true so I wouldn&#8217;t be &#8220;catfished&#8221; in essence. Nowadays, we are becoming more reliant on social media to learn about each other, which is concerning because it is so easy to create an inaccurate depiction of yourself.</p>
