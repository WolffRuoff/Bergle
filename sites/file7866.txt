								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After searching myself on multiple different search engines, I found very interesting things. When ever I would search myself, the internet would for some reason try to auto correct my name from two l&#8217;s in Hillburn to one l. With my name spelled with one l it turns out the results would come up with a much wider variety of people compared to Hillburns with two l&#8217;s. At the top of all the pages were mainly football related that includes things like my hudl account, videos of football camps I attended and my highlights. What also came up was my twitter profile and tweets I have posted. This really enforces the fact that everything posted online can be seen and makes me think about how careful I have to be with what I post online. Just a few scrolls down comes up a man with a profile about him going to jail and that is something I definitely would not want people to get confused with for me. What also surprised me is that a few years back I searched myself and found that a division one lacrosse player with the same name as me would come up and now I do not see him on the same page as me. This experience was very eye opening and just reinforces the fact that social media can be very dangerous if you do not be careful and can influence peoples opinions on you without even meeting you.</p>
