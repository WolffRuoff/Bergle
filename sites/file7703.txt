								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A day in the life of the internet by Michael Keshen describes how the ordinary computer user uses technology today. The enormity of the hold that the internet has on our lives is incredible. The internet allows for people to be in constant contact with larger audiences. To put this into perspective the article A Day in the Life of the Internet by Mike Keshen provides an interesting statistic<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>of one hundred million people logging into twitter daily (Keshen, 2014). One hundred and forty characters of tweeted information can potentially reach one hundred million people a day. The article also stresses the importance of how the internet is becoming more convenient with $717,808,219 dollars spent on online purchases (Keshen, 2014). </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Information is at our fingertips virtually any moment that we need it. Proof of this concept was exemplified in the previously stated statistic of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>how many people actually use the internet.We rely on the information given to us because it is easy and convenient to access. This is represented even in our class time. With a click of a button Zoltero can immediately cite a article for a paper. I find this extremely innovative because it really shows how far we have progressed in technology. To reemphasize this point it is important to look back to see how far we have grown technologically. “Two centuries ago Leibnitz invented a calculating machine which embodied most of the essential features of recent keyboard devices, but it could not then come into use. The economics of the situation were against it: the labor involved in constructing it, before the days of mass production, exceeded the labor to be saved by its use, since all it could accomplish could be duplicated by sufficient use of pencil and paper” (Bush,1945). It is truly incredible feat to see how far technology has come since the pen and paper. Also we can see differences in our priorities because in the olden days the cost was too astronomical to see a potential in technology. Now we are constantly advancing technology and spending all of our time and resources on it. </span></p>
