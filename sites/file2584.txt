<p>Remember getting up early on Saturda<img class="alignleft" src="http://www.flowersbyvalerie.com/images/FBVED007.jpg" alt="" width="144" height="122" />y mornings to watch cartoons?  You undoubtedly remember such classics as <em>Recess </em>and <em>Pepper Ann</em>, but you probably also remember those bright, flashy advertisements for products like Gushers, Dunkaroos, and Kraft Mac and Cheese.  However, there have been some changes regarding food and drink advertising aimed towards kids.  After years of scrutiny from the FCC, 17 advertisers, including Burger King and Kraft, have not only improved the health content of their products, but have also changed their marketing strategies.  This agreement is called the Children’s Food and Beverage Advertising Initiative and is a creation of the Council of Better Business Bureaus.  In 2007, these advertisers pledged to promote healthy products in at least half of their media targeted to children.  In January 2010, promoting healthy products during kids’ ad times became an official requirement for businesses that are part of the Council of Better Business Bureaus.  Furthermore, major junk-food companies like Coca-Cola and Hershey have made it their policy to not advertise to children under the age of twelve.</p>
<p><span id="more-980"></span></p>
<p>Why would these companies volunteer to cut down its advertisers to its most eager customers?  It’s probably not because they’re worried about the dental hygiene of America’s youth.  More likely, it’s because these food companies want to avoid government regulation.  If these companies change their programming strategies, they can keep the FCC, playing the authority power role, from imposing its own rules.</p>
<p>We should also consider the role of the Council of Better Business Bureaus, the committee responsible for establishing these new protocols for kids’ food and drink advertising.  Though the BBB theoretically functions as a facilitator that encourages upright business practices and tells consumers which businesses are operating fairly, many have questioned the BBB’s cozy relationship with the very companies that it is supposed to be monitoring.  As businesses pay to be part of the BBB, the council has a strong interest in keeping these businesses happy. If the BBB comes out with strong criticisms against a powerful business, this business could stop participating in the BBB, taking with it its crucial resource: money.  Therefore, it seems unlikely that the BBB was interested in looking out for the health of young TV fans, and more likely that it was trying to assist the businesses that it depends on for its own survival.  For more on the questionable BBB practices, check out this <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2009/jan/21/business/fi-lazarus21">LA Times article</a>.</p>
<p>Another strategy that food and drink companies have taken to avoid FCC regulations is to shift the target of the advertisements from kids to their parents.  Daytime broadcast programming has benefitted from this shift, as advertisers know that this is when some parents (including stay at home moms) watch TV.  Additionally, these advertisers have become more interested in the traditional primetime hours (especially 8pm) as this is a time when both parents and kids watch TV together.  Now more than ever, advertisers are willing to pay a lot for these times slots, which, in turn, encourages the networks to expand their family friendly primetime programming.  This is an example of the advertiser’s, or client’s, ability to influence the types of shows that networks, or producers, create and air.</p>
<p>This example shows the lengths that TV advertisers will go to in order to avoid government regulation.  By making some concessions and shifting their target audience, America’s food and drink companies can both evade strict government rules, and, at the same time, continue to create new generations of French fry fiends and soda slurpers.</p>
