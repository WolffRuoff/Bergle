								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you were to tell the creators of the internet how big and how widely used it would become in the 21st century, they probably would laugh at you. They would not understand how regular users have made it what it has become. The Internet now has the ability to connect so many people though laughter using a single media object and a phrase. These funny and sometimes disturbing images or media objects are known throughout the internet world as memes. Memes however, can become extremely dangerous. They can degrade individuals and even whole groups of people as well as causing damage to cultures and ethnicities. Memes can be extremely funny for everyone if used properly.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The peer-reviewed article I read was </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Reflections on Internet Culture</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">. The article talked about internet memes and how society reacted to them. Some memes pass through the eyes of the internet harmlessly while others may not. One major theme that appears throughout the article is how what you say or do online may affect other things offline. Zittrain writes, “Star Wars Kid turned to the court system, and filed a host of lawsuits against the school, the kids, their parents,” (Zittrain, 2014, p. 390). Star Wars Kid was a video that received 28 million hits on Youtube of a kid who was swinging a golf ball retriever not knowing he was being recorded. His friends thought it would be funny if they posted it online, it became an instant hit. This just goes to show how you never know how somebody will react when you post something about them online. Something may seem harmless to post online at first but may actually be harmful in the long run.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This can relate to another major theme brought up in the article. The theme of  online privacy and the argument of whether it is right to post about someone online just because it is funny. The author uses the example of Disaster girl in his writing, “a perfect example of unsought fame of a sort. She is not superimposed in the photo. She is actually standing in front of that house. The element of authenticity that this photo captures so well, though, means there is a real person implicated as it starts to go viral” (Zittrain, 2014, p. 389). I believe what the author is saying is that these people did not mind that they became famous through a meme. They thought it was funny when people would take the picture of a cute innocent girl standing in front of a burning house and add a funny caption. Other people, like Star Wars Kid, did not think it was so funny when they were posted online.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Overall, I think memes are great. They can be funny, insightful, and even inspiring. They have the ability to make people laugh and share a connection together. I also believe that since they are so powerful they can be used to hurt people. The argument of online privacy is found in every part of the internet including memes. I believe that if people are a little more careful with the power of memes they can be more enjoyable for everyone.</span></p>
