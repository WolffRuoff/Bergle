								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Graser, Marc. (2011, March 31). WB, Sony, U, and Fox cue premium VOD. <em>Variety</em>.

<p><a href="http://mediaindustries11.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/03/home_theter_04-535x354.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1018" src="http://mediaindustries11.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/03/home_theter_04-535x354-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a>In a controversial business venture that could significantly impact the film industry and its audiences, four major film studios have announced their involvement in the launch of Home Premiere, a premium video-on-demand service for feature films. Beginning next month, Warner Bros., Sony, Universal and 20th Century Fox will offer recently released theatrical films for a $30 fee over a two-to-three day viewing period, at the discretion of each particular studio. Several cable systems will offer the service, with DirecTV launching it initially to its 20 million customers. Warner Bros.&#8217; action thriller &#8220;Unknown&#8221; (2011) and Sony&#8217;s romantic comedy &#8220;Just Go With It&#8221; (2011) will be the first major releases offered via Home Premiere. While discussing the reasons this endeavor has come to fruition, studios have argued that offering these films for the $30 rate 60 days after theatrical release will <em>not</em> harm either box office returns or the financial stability of exhibitors, claiming that films make most of their money at the box office within the first three months. Further, these studios claim that the expense of a night out at the movies for families has harmed them financially between the cost of concessions, tickets, and possible babysitters, and this VOD service seeks to appease this by offering an opportunity to view relatively recent films at a cost that would be lower than an average trip to the theater.<span id="more-1016"></span></p>
<p>However, exhibitors and NATO (the National Association of Theater Owners) have expressed disappointment and anger over their fears of this premium VOD plan having a negative effect on theaters. In a statement, a NATO spokesman recently said, &#8220;They risk damaging theatrical revenues without actually delivering what  the home consumer seems to want, which is flexibility, portability and a  low price. These plans fundamentally alter the economic relationship  between exhibitors, filmmakers and producers, and the studios taking  part in this misguided venture.&#8221; In other words, a prominent concern of the exhibition viewpoint of the industry regards possible repercussions this new service could have on theatrical box office revenues.</p>
<p>Several theater chains, including Regal Entertainment, have threatened studios with the possibility of not releasing particular films if they are released on demand just six weeks after opening. Hypothetically, if Regal were to actually go through with this, it would have a devastating effect on nearly all theatrical grosses, as Regal is the largest theater chain in the U.S. When DirecTV initially proposed the VOD launch in February, they had mentioned the possibility of a short four-to-six week window between theatrical release and VOD release. This was when Regal threatened a boycott, and the four major studios had to intervene and talk DirecTV into lengthening the window to 60 days.</p>
<p>This is a striking example of power roles at work in the industry of motion pictures. In terms of the agreement to extend the window to 60 days from roughly 40, the exhibitors wielded their power over the distributors. Without the cooperation of Regal, the nation&#8217;s most prominent movie exhibitor chain, the studios would stand to lose millions of dollars in this risky endeavor. Although the exhibitors and NATO still seem unsure of Home Premiere&#8217;s possible financial implications, they are nonetheless on board with it, at least for now. It remains to be seen what the future holds for this new service, and whether it will be profitable overall or a financial bust. In the meantime, however, the fight between the different entities involved (specifically the exhibitors and distributors) has revealed a great deal of the number of compromises that go on behind the scenes in the motion picture industry.</p>
