								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Everyone relies on Google and other search engines for information. And when googling someone so much information comes up about who they are and what they are doing with their lives. But, sometimes the correct person that you are looking for comes up because there is other people out there that could have the same name.</p>
<p>I have actually googled myself multiple times to look up statistics for lacrosse and other things for the recruiting process. So I had a pretty good idea of what was going to come up. As I expected most of what comes up is for lacrosse, different profiles I have created for recruiting and a statistics website that my high school is on and then my Twitter also comes up.</p>
<p>Then when I go to photos there are photos of me, some members of my family, some friends, and then photos of people that I do not know at all. There are several photos that appear from different social medias that I have. Along with photos from social media there are photos from school events that I am in or I was at the event that the photo was taken at if I am not actually in the photo. When I go to the news tab it is just articles for lacrosse and that is it. Then in videos it is also just lacrosse footage. I have never posted anything to YouTube except for my lacrosse highlight tape and I indirectly did that because it is under my name, but my dad actually posted it on there for me.</p>
<p>Nothing comes up that I am ashamed of or do not want being viewed when my name is googled so I think I have done a good job on being cautious on the Internet.</p>
