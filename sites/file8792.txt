								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“You have to see it to believe it.” Those were the words of a young student referring to the new learning methods used in his classroom. (Google for Education, 2015) In the 21<sup>st</sup> century, it has become incredibly unrealistic when teaching students about the variety of places around the world. However, this is coming to an end. What if you could see anywhere in the world all through a single lens? With Google Cardboard and the company’s new Expeditions program, this has been made possible. Today’s society is in the midst of excessive technological growth and change. Things are being done now that were never imaginable back in the day. Google’s Expeditions Pioneer Program brings class lessons to life. It offers an enriched experience that’s more interactive by letting students enter a world beyond their imagination by putting the globe right before their eyes. Learning has become that much easier.</p>
<p>Many believe it’s hard to learn the true meaning of a place without visiting it in person. Luckily for them, this is all about to change. Just a few years ago, Google unveiled a virtual reality headset known as Google Cardboard. And now it’s taking that one step further. Google’s Expeditions program lets you go places that were never thought conceivable. The program has already reached classrooms in the United States, United Kingdom, Brazil and Australia with many to come. But what’s so great about it? All for an exceptionally low cost, anyone can travel the world through a single lens. It’s quite remarkable.</p>
<p>With Cardboard, Google reinvented virtual reality. While textbooks are a great source for information, they’re sometimes hard to get and not everyone can afford them. Taking the subject Geography for example, while textbooks can show you a bevy of images taken from various places and wonders of the world, they don’t supply a full experience. This has left many wanting something more. According to (Google for Education, 2015), one of Expedition’s major strengths consists of just about anyone being able see the world through a lens in three-hundred and sixty degrees. Students can now walk through the jungle, visit the Great Wall of China, climb through the mountains, and even dive into the deep blue ocean. Many agree that this is the future of education and are shaken by how far technology has come. This relates to our class discussions at the beginning of the semester regarding recent technological growth. The experience is like no other. It’s believed by many that student takeaways will be much larger than one’s gains from just reading. Teachers believe it’s essential that students are able to see what they’re actually learning about in order to learn it properly.</p>
<p>An Expedition can best be described as a guided tour in which schools and buses aren’t capable of. While the list of places is quite vast already, it’s always growing to capture the world. Using Cardboard virtual reality headsets, students can physically walk around on the moon or fly over the Rocky Mountains just by tilting their head and pointing towards a certain direction. During the session, teachers can point out highlights while discussing their class notes at the same time. Many have come to the conclusion that this immerse experience makes learning more fun, interactive and thrilling, which can be seen in the video (Google for Education, 2015) during the student’s reactions. The headset is composed of nearly all cardboard keeping the price down, and thus allowing students all around the world to gain access to it.</p>
<p>Can you imagine sitting in class and visiting some the world’s greatest monuments without ever leaving the room? Now students can live this dream. The journey of Expeditions has just begun. Students worldwide can now see what it’s like in another continent or biome without the need to travel there. With the development of this product along with many others, it has become clear that technology has grown to a point where many can’t even believe the outcomes. There’s so much out there to see in such a small life span, and this device helps us conquer the world at our own convenience. Relating back to the common theme, it’s these experiences that will allow students to thrive in their academics, further enhance their education and develop a better understanding of the world around them. Who knows where it will take us next.</p>
