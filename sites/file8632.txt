								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the article, <em>Social Media Is Redefining ‘Depression’, </em>Bine discusses how Tumblr has become a major platform for teenage girls with mental illness to express themselves publicly in an anonymous way. Tumblr is a form of social media that was developed to promote photography and blogging through pictures. Bine interviews a teenage girl named Laura who has fell victim to the massive online Tumblr community that accepts her for her depression. Bine mentions the Silver Bubble Problem, in which it is, “difficult for those inside the community to see the outside world…But they often don’t want to get out because to leave the community would be to lose the people who understand them.” (Bine 2013, p. 4) While being accepted though, Laura’s identity is still able to remain hidden from the people she knows in the outside world. This anonymity produces its own safety in knowing that “nobody” will find out about what you post. Bine goes on to discuss how a combination of intense feelings, misunderstanding, and a closed off online community all contribute to the exponential rise in depression throughout this upcoming generation.</p>
<p>Yes, Depression combined with an online community of other depressed people is leading to a glorification of a serious mental health issue. When depressed teenagers take to Tumblr, it leads to a, “growing community of people feeding off of each other’s strong emotions, and it’s definitely visible online.” (Bine 2013, p. 3) And yes, it is definitely accurate to say that not everyone who reblogs depressing imagery is clinically depressed themselves and many “adolescents are confusing the clinical disorder called ‘depression’ with normal, everyday challenges.” (Bine 2013, p. 2) However, when Tumblr users feel almost, “strong, beautiful, and mysterious” (Bine 2013, p. 2) for posting, “black and white photos with scars along their wrists, from taking razor blades to their skin” (Bine 2013, p. 1) and are recognized and most infamously, praised for it, this is where the problem of interpretation begins.</p>
<p>Bine is ignorantly incorrect to state that the self expression pertaining to depression has created a, “frenzy” (Bine 2013, p. 2) on Tumblr, for she thinks girls are giving into peer pressure and are self-harming because it is the cool thing to do. It is extremely offensive for Bine to label this social phenomenon as people who are, “‘wannabe depressed’” (Bine 2013, p. 2). Nobody wants to be depressed.  This insensitive label invalidates an adolescent’s emotions, which is all he/she really wants from posting on Tumblr in the first place. This is the problem. The controversy is in the way that these feelings are being expressed and the validity that comes with them. Teenage girls are being praised for being depressed, which turns depression into something that is normal or healthy. Teenagers are aloud to express themselves on the internet, but when it comes to mental illness, there should be a community focusing on recovery and support. Bine misinterprets and invalidates these depression blogs as teenagers, “advertising their suffering.” (Bine 2013, p. 5) She misses the point completely, and doesn’t realize that these teens are going through a difficult time and are simply calling for help through the only tool they feel comfortable with, the internet. The conversation of handling depression is very important in this day and age, however, it must be emphasizing healthy and appropriate ways to treat and overcome depression, not casting it off as an indulgent frenzied phenomenon.</p>
