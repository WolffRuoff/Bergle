								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Reading, often viewed as a dreadful act by students, is much more than just a means of getting individuals to remember the information being presented. As Mike Hanski writes in a piece for the <em>Huffington Post</em>, reading plays a pivotal role in molding the type of writer a person becomes. According to Hanski (2014, p. 1), writing is not a skill that can simply be attained by the memorization of grammatical rules, punctuation marks, and various writing styles. Rather, one becomes a phenomenal writer by reading. Studies have shown that reading produces a source of inspiration for many, leads to increased knowledge, prepares children for school, enables writers to understand their readers, and does much more. Additionally, reading “makes our lives easier” in the long run (Hanski, 2014, p. 3). Hanski (2014, p.3) notes that reading is responsible for broadening our minds, opening our hearts to new things, and teaching us to respect others.</p>
<p>In the grand scheme of things, reading is not so bad. The path to communicating with others effectively starts with reading “as it connects [people] to the rest of the whole world” (Hanski, 2014, p. 2). Communication can be considered more crucial in today’s society than it has ever been before. With so many different communication platforms around, one is constantly expected to be able to convey his/her thoughts. However, several means of modern communication would not be possible without writing. Take email and social media sites such as Twitter and Facebook as prime examples. As people communicate via email, Twitter, and Facebook, they write down their thoughts electronically. While much of what is posted to Twitter and Facebook is written informally by misinformed people, there are instances when individuals make valid points. These points are typically well-thought-out and well-written. This type of writing, as Hanski (2014, p.1) points out, would not be possible without people first making the effort to read about their topic of discussion.</p>
<p>If everyone decided that reading was futile, people would constantly be uninformed about prevalent issues. Moreover, communication between friends, family, high-level business executives, teachers, students, and even the president of the United States and the general public could not exist, as it does today, without individuals first taking the time to read. Just as Hanski (2014, p. 2) writes, one should take the time to read something that he/she enjoys. A person will ultimately find that he/she is not only better equipped to discuss what has been read, but to write about it as well.</p>
