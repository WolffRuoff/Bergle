								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From what I can remember, I first used technology at three years old. I remember watching Teletubbies over and over again. Around four, my parents got me a desktop computer. I used to spend hours playing educational games and always wanting more. I had a Gameboy Advanced where I’d play Super Mario Brothers 2 and get mad at me not being able to finish levels. I once got so mad I, no joke, bit the screen and thus breaking it. After making the transition to kindergarten, I began to watch more TV and do more on the computer. All my friends were talking about that newest Spongebob episode, but I, oddly enough, was not allowed to watch it. To this day, I still haven’t seen one full episode of the show. As I got further into grade school, it was the coolest thing to have a cell phone and a DS. I remember begging my mom to get me a cell phone but she did get me a DS though. I continued to use my computer and watch TV while everyone else seemed cooler because of that phone. In the computer lab at our school, we began to learn to use the computer better on this <em>Learning.com</em> website. I don’t remember the exact site because that was grade school. It was a fun activity because it was interactive and it gave us a sense of accomplishment when we finished it. There were word games, typing puzzles, Excel, Word, and PowerPoint were some of the things I remember doing. When sixth grade rolled around, those skills were put to the test in our first research project The night I finished sixth grade, my parents took me and my sister out to hibachi, the Japanese place where they make the food in front of you. At the conclusion of dinner and desert, my mom handed me a gift. I remember thinking to myself “What’s this for?” before blurting it out my mouth. She just told me to open it. Doing as she instructed, I unwrapped a new phone. I was so happy that this wish of mine came true. I don’t remember what it was but I loved it. It had a slide out keyboard and I could load games onto it. I ended up dropping it half way through seventh grade and my parents upgraded me to a Pantech Laser with the same slide out keyboard. That got me to High School. In eighth grade, specifically on my sister’s birthday, we both got a box. We opened them to find paper iPhones. My sister and I were so confused. We ended up each getting an iPhone 4 while my parents got the 4s. In 9<sup>th</sup> grade, I remember playing it in class. I got caught one too many times and I got my apps taken off for good. I was so distressed. In 10<sup>th</sup> grade, I began watching YouTube videos through Safari on cellular data at lunch. I used my data so fast I really needed to tone it down. After I got Safari taken away, I just stopped really using the phone until iOS 7 came around. iTunes Radio got me through the 45-minute, 6:20am bus ride to school and the 2:12pm, 30-minute bus ride back still using data. My parents upgraded to a shared 10GB plan; I still used 75% of the total data every month. I got an Instagram account but deleted it soon after because I really didn’t have much to do on it. Then, earlier this year, my parents decided to take us on a “family trip” that my sister and I were not given any information about. They ended up getting us the iPhone 6s. A few months ago, my grandmother offered to get me a computer for use at school. This turned into the mac that I use. I had used a Mac since 2009 when my mom got a MacBook pro. It seemed easier to use and paired well with our iPhones. This completes my technology timeline for now as the future holds a great many secrets ready to be uncovered.</p>
