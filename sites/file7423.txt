								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The talk with Jim Groom gave me a new perspective on the dangers of the internet. The sheer amount of spying the government does is awful. Although I put next to nothing about myself online, I can’t help but feel like I should be putting a tin foil hat on. My data should be my own and not the government’s. I understand the concern about national security but having data about every American is just wrong. There are those who just want to live a private life and not have to deal with the government spying on them. Although I’m flattered that the government finds my internet activities interesting, this might be stalker-ish. The pizza call was what really made me scared. If companies could have access to that much information on us, what would stop them from inserting ads everywhere. You might be on a conference call with your boss when all of a sudden an ad for soap pops up in the call. The sheer amount of invasion of privacy in that one situation alone is unbelievable. Once the government has it, what’s to stop companies from doing the same? It’s a blatant invasion of innocent people’s privacy that needs to be stopped. No matter how much the government says it’s just for safety reasons, the line between safety and the straight up mass-stalking the American public is being increasingly tested. It really makes you wonder what is really your information and data verses what the government claims is yours.</p>
