<p>Albiniak.P (2011 March 14) Selling the Glee: Twentieth Television turns its attention to pitching its hit to stations for 2013 <em>Broadcasting and Cable </em>retrived from:<a href="http://0-web.ebscohost.com.library.muhlenberg.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=01ff61a1-db46-49b8-b3ca-e777fb23c69a%40sessionmgr10&amp;vid=7&amp;hid=15">http://0-web.ebscohost.com.library.muhlenberg.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=01ff61a1-db46-49b8-b3ca-e777fb23c69a%40sessionmgr10&amp;vid=7&amp;hid=15</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whether it’s on magazine covers or red carpet shows, the stars of Glee seem to be everywhere.  But Twentieth Television, which produces Glee, has plans to make the show even more ubiquitous.  Glee’s original episodes air on the Fox network, which makes sense as both Twentieth Television and Fox are owned by News Corps—both producer and distributor are owned by the same media conglomerate.   However, last summer, Twentieth Television sold syndication rights of Glee to Oxygen, a network owned by NBC Universal, which falls under the Comcast umbrella.  Here we see one television distributor making a deal with another one—a deal that has proved beneficial for NBC Universal’s Oxygen, which earned a record 4.4 million viewers during a weekend of Glee re-runs (a “Gleekend”).<span id="more-1032"></span></p>
<p>But Twentieth Television’s plans for Glee don&#8217;t stop there.   Twentieth’s mission is to get the rest of the country on board the “Glee train.” The television producer is seeking to sell syndication rights to television stations, both Fox affiliates and independent stations,across the country. This represents an attempt to go directly to exhibitors,many of whom have hours that need to be filled with content.  Glee re-runs could be a very viable option for these stations: the show’s audience is predominately female, and, crucially, predominately affluent.  This is the kind of audience that advertisers, or clients, are willing spend a lot of money on, as this demographic has a lot of buying power. Plus, Glee has proven to be a ratings smash, with both new episodes and re-runs earning large audiences, so acquiring the rights to air Glee could be financially smart for the exhibitors that are given the opportunity to grab a slice of the Glee pie.</p>
<p>As if that wasn’t enough, there is a spin-off reality show in the works. This summer, Oxygen will air The Glee Project, a reality show in which contestants will compete for a spot on Glee.  This program is yet another example of Glee’s already-abundant examples of linking pin activities, including CDs and music downloads featuring the songs head on the show.</p>
