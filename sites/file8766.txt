								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When people talk about Microsoft, the first thing that usually comes to people’s mind is Bill Gates and the software that he developed that made people’s lives so much easier. What a lot of people do not know however, is that Microsoft has many more services and software products marketed toward teens and gamers. The Wikipedia article I read was on Xbox Live which is an online multiplayer gaming and digital media delivery service developed by Microsoft. Most teens know about Xbox Live because it allows you to play video games online with your friends. It is an extremely popular service and mostly everyone that has ever owned a Microsoft gaming product has used it at least once. Xbox Live comes in two forms, Xbox Live Free and Xbox Live Gold. Xbox Live Gold being a subscription based service. Xbox Live offers a wide variety of features for the user. The most popular being the online gaming portion of the service.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One main theme that occurs from a lot of these gaming services is immersion. Most of them allow you to create and control an avatar and become fully immersed in the gaming world. As well as creating avatars, players can create and customize profiles based on their offline personalities and interests. Some people are skeptical of this because more and more kids are spending the majority of their time with online gaming. All these different elements of Xbox Live make it difficult for the user to get off. It has become addicting to some people to the point where they do not want to leave the gaming world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Microsoft has done something really smart with Xbox Live. They have made so many first and third party apps available on the service that it makes the user feel like he or she will never have to go anywhere else to use them. This means that Microsoft has essentially made Xbox Live the go to service to use these apps. Microsoft figures that the people using Xbox Live are most likely digital natives, so they market and sell Xbox Live accordingly. They also supply features on Xbox Live that fit that description. This is smart because as a digital native I figure that any apps I want to use will probably be on my Xbox. This maximizes the amount of users Xbox Live will have at any given moment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With online interaction also comes the dangers of cyberbullying, but what Xbox Live has done is that it has integrated different features to be safe online like muting, reporting, and blocking. It even has a “reputation” feature that allows people to see how good your in game conduct is. The truth is Xbox Live is expanding and it will keep getting bigger and more popular. Wikipedia writes, “As of December 16, 2012, Xbox Live is currently available in 42 countries/territories” and “Bloomberg estimates that Xbox Live likely generated over </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar"><span style="font-weight: 400">$</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">1 billion in revenue in the 2010 fiscal year, which ended on June 30, 2010.” These facts are only a little bit of information on how big Xbox Live could become especially with the progression of technology and gaming. I agree on the fact that Xbox Live is getting bigger because I know gaming is too. Online gaming can only get more popular as more people are looking for services to allow them to play online.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Overall, I believe Xbox Live is an extremely useful and popular service that lets you connect with people and friends all around the world, 42 countries to be exact. Gaming and online gaming services have just began to scratch the surface of all the different possibilities. It will be exciting to see in the future how much it can potentially expand.</span></p>
