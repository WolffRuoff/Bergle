<p>As busy college students, many of us find it difficult to sit down to watch our favorite shows when they originally air. That’s what makes a website like <a href="http://www.hulu.com/">Hulu</a> so convenient—this online television option makes it easy to catch up on <em>Glee</em> or <em>The Office</em> in between classes (or parties).  Also attractive to college students is the fact that Hulu is free, as the site earns its money from advertisers rather than from users.  While Hulu is fantastic for busy TV fans, it is not necessarily ideal for television networks—while the networks are given a share of Hulu’s advertising revenue, some have deemed this percentage inadequate (check out this <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/03/business/media/03hulu.html?scp=1&amp;sq=hulu%20and%20comedy%20central&amp;st=Search"><em>New York Times</em> article</a>, which describes Comedy Central’s grievances with and temporary departure from Hulu).   Adding to the industry’s woes is the difficulty of measuring ratings from Hulu, which is also tied to profits, as networks use ratings as a resource to lure advertisers.  This dilemma was the topic of this &#8220;State of the TV Industry&#8221; panel at the February 15th TV Summit, an event hosted by the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences Foundation and <em>Variety</em>.</p>
<p><span id="more-892"></span></p>
<p>Television distribution has become extremely fragmented, providing audiences with a choice of where and how to watch TV shows.  Much like Tivo, a site like Hulu acts as a distributor that, in many ways, empowers audiences:  viewers aren’t bound to network-determined schedules and can watch their favorite shows when they want, free of charge.  The television industry’s effort to monetize this online content, a goal expressed by several members of the “State of the TV Industry” panel, creates a bit of a power struggle between audience and producer, with the distributor, Hulu, in the position of middleman with the ability to direct the flow of power.   However, the networks have some muscle when dealing with Hulu as they control a resource that is absolutely crucial to Hulu’s operation: content.  If a network is not satisfied with Hulu’s method of compensation, the network can simply withdraw its content from the site, which could cost Hulu viewers, and, as a result, money from advertisers.  Taking this power structure into consideration, we anticipate that Hulu will eventually shift into a completely subscription-based system (the site did recently add a premium option, <a href="http://www.hulu.com/plus">Hulu Plus</a>, which cost users $7.99 a month) in order to boost the percentage of its profits that it directs to the participating networks, which will ensure that these networks continue to provide Hulu with the content the site needs to hold onto audiences.</p>
<p>While much of the TV Summit discussion centered on the necessity of making a profit from online content, some panelists were more concerned with the quality of the content itself, with some industry insiders emphasizing the importance of inspired writers and emotionally-gripping story lines.  But when it comes to the issue of monetizing online television, it will be producers and investors, rather than TV writers or creators, who will exercise the most influence over this technological and financial issue.  However, if the networks’ monetization dreams do come true, audiences will, hopefully, demand top-notch quality if we’re asked to pay top-dollar to watch TV online.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jack, M., &amp; Hudson, J. (2011, Jan. 31). LX New York is Alive at Five. <em>Broadcasting &amp; Cable, (141,5).</em> Retrieved from <a href="http://0-web.ebscohost.com.library.muhlenberg.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?hid=8&amp;sid=f5b72ee7-0ab7-4b24-879e-1f00d0d749ae%40sessionmgr11&amp;vid=4" target="_blank">http://0-web.ebscohost.com.library.muhlenberg.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?hid=8&amp;sid=f5b72ee7-0ab7-4b24-879e-1f00d0d749ae%40sessionmgr11&amp;vid=4</a></p>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://assets.nydailynews.com/img/2010/04/06/alg_lx_new_york2.jpg" alt="" width="257" height="176" /></p>
<p>Hoping to interest a new target audience, WMBC New York executives created the 60-minute news program <em>LX New York</em>, which airs daily at 5:00 pm. At first, ratings were less than impressive. As a result, the creators decided to implement some key changes to the show&#8217;s format. These changes were linked to another decision: WMBC executives decided to specifically target suburban women.  To increase show ratings and appeal to these viewers, <em>LX New York</em> started utilizing the city more.  For example, the show began airing cooking segments filmed on the city streets and in local restaurants instead of in the studio. The new and improved <em>LX New York</em> also features celebrity interviews, cooking segments,news snippets, and a topic of the day.</p>
<p><span id="more-823"></span>Additionally, executives brought on a new host, former news anchor Jane Hanson.  By serving as a familiar face, Hanson comes with her own fans, thus, brings more viewers to<em> LX New York</em>.  Producers also created a social media campaign, which included an online, live viewer chat about the show. Specifically, the online resources and viewer chats act as a linking pin for <em>LX New York</em>, an example of a symbiotic relationship between television and internet. Most importantly,the live chats provide a sense of community for fans, forming personal ties and relationship to the show while also providing feedback to producers.  That way, both audiences and producers benefit and gain a sense of power.<br />
<!--more--><br />
However, WMCS and viewers are not the only parties benefitting from the revamped <em>LX New York</em>.  A unique way the show presents its advertisers is through integration into segments, which would not be done in a newscast. For instance, the grocery store chain, Fairway, has sponsored cooking bits. This unique kind of advertising is enticing for advertisers since the product is actually integrated into the program, as opposed to using commercials, which can be bypassed.  This is especially relevant in the age of changing television exhibition, with technologies such as Tivo allowing viewers to simply fast-forward through commercials.</p>
<p>Competitors are thrilled with WMBC’s New York’s change because the new program does not target a news audience anymore, even though it is running during a timeslot traditionally reserved for news programs.  Of course, if the show does too well, it could spawn imitators, which could lead to the replacement of serious news with soft entertainment—a potentially dangerous transition for a democratic society that relies on an informed citizenry.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Morabito, Andrea. (2011, Feb. 7). <em>Broadcasting &amp; Cable. </em>Retrieved from <a href="http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/463581-Super_Bowl_XLV_is_Most_Watched_TV_Program_Ever.php" target="_blank">http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/463581-Super_Bowl_XLV_is_Most_Watched_TV_Program_Ever.php</a>.</p>
<p>Super Bowl XLV last Sunday February 6, was the most watched television show in U.S. history. The game averaged 111 million total views. This beat last year’s Super Bowl’s record of 106.5 million spectators. The Super Bowl always rakes in extreme high numbers of viewers and for the past four years has set a viewership records.</p>
<p>            After the Super Bowl, an episode of <em>Glee</em> aired from 10:30 to 11:45 p.m. 26.8 million people watched increasing its total viewers 17% from its weekly average.<em> Glee’s</em> numbers were bigger than the episode of <em>The Office</em> that followed 2009’s Super Bowl. However, last year’s post Super Bowl’s episode of <em>Undercover Boss</em> drew bigger numbers than both <em>Glee </em>and The <em>Office.<span id="more-769"></span></em></p>
<p>            We suspect that the broad audience of a reality television show would lure in more viewers than a musically based high school sitcom. This makes us think about the idea of public interest and why Fox chose such a special interest show that does not seem to fit the same audience as the Super Bowl. An event like the Super Bowl can unite all different ages and demographics showing the positive possibilities for television. When Fox chooses to show a program like <em>Glee</em>, we feel the network has other motives in mind besides the public interest. Were they trying to attract a broader audience to increase network’s long term viewership? Was Fox trying to piggy back off of the popularity of the Super Bowl to increase <em>Glee’s</em> fan base? While <em>Glee</em> has proved its success, we feel that a show like <em>Undercover Boss</em> which has a wider appeal may have been a better fit for the Super Bowl’s audience’s actual desires and interests. This brings us back to the power relationship between the network heads and the audience. Networks don’t necessarily have to give audiences what may be best but instead they focus on what may be most lucrative, ultimately choosing their rising star, <em>Glee</em>. While traditional all-American football fans may not always mix with musical theater lovers, with Fox has anything to say about it, they will.</p>
