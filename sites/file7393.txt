								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Social media is a major part of my life. Quite frankly, I can&#8217;t remember the last time I&#8217;ve gone a full day without using social media. Social media gives me this sense of power and control because it allows me to show off my profile to the public. Though it isn&#8217;t a palpable object, social media almost feels like a possession, despite the fact that I share it with millions of people. It feels like my own possession because I have control over the people I follow, the posts that I like, and more. After this week&#8217;s discussion with Jim Groom, as well as the assigned reading, I&#8217;m starting to second guess the amount of trust I put into social media. Not only that, but I&#8217;m beginning to realize that the companies of social media profit from us using social media just as much as we do.</p>
<p><em>The best things in life are free?</em> Think again. According to Jim Groom, any website or app that is free entails that there is no privacy. This is a tactic of the social media companies because it attracts more people to sign up since there&#8217;s no cost. But it turns out that this is a loophole: the cost is your personal privacy. The more you use social media, the more of your &#8220;history&#8221; it records. On apps such as Instagram, nobody really knows who exactly controls your history. Though it is concerning that private and important information can be controlled by social media companies, many users (including myself) continue to take a risk and trust these companies.</p>
<p>These companies also manipulate us by making us think that they are providing for us, but in reality we are providing for them. According to Audrey Watters, &#8220;our content and our data, shared publicly, become theirs to profit from” (Watters 2016). In her article, Watters discusses how us users are the ones working for social media companies. This strikes me because when I sign up for a social media account, I don&#8217;t sign up to work for them&#8230;I sign up for them to work for me.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;d be lying if I said I don&#8217;t care about how many likes my Instagram posts get. If I don&#8217;t get as many likes as I expected for a post, a part of me feels disappointed. There&#8217;s something about getting a lot of likes that is so fulfilling and satisfying. When I first got an Instagram, I was always jealous of people who got more likes than me. I was so desperate at one point, that I used #likesforlikes to get strangers to like my posts. Why must we be in this preconceived notion that we are defined by numbers?</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not against social sharing, I&#8217;m against the current status of social media.&#8221; -Essena O&#8217;Neill, a 19-year-old from Australia (BuzzFeedBlue 2015). From a glimpse at her Instagram, O&#8217;Neill looks like she has it all. Not only is she gorgeous and has a small figure, but she has over half a million followers on Instagram and gets thousands of likes. Who wouldn&#8217;t want to be like that? Well it turns out that her &#8220;perfect&#8221; life isn&#8217;t as perfect as it seems. Because she got so Instagram-famous, O&#8217;Neill felt this pressure to continue posting picture-perfect posts of herself. She became miserable because &#8220;she became addicted to the approval of her appearance&#8221;, and the only thing that made her feel better was getting more likes and followers (BuzzFeedBlue 2015). As a result, O&#8217;Neill changed the captions of her pictures to expose how these &#8220;candid&#8221; pictures were staged so that she would look her absolute best.</p>
<p>I feel that even though we live in an era of technological advancements, we should all take a step back and look at what is truly important. Family, friends, health, equality&#8230;values in life that can&#8217;t be defined by numbers. It is up to us social media users to get out of this habit of caring about likes and start caring about things that are authentic.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I got a Facebook when I was 12, I was ecstatic because it was my first time using social media. I didn&#8217;t create an account to truly expose my identity, however. I just sought to communicate with my friends and acquaintances. In 7th grade, there was a trend with the girls in my school to change your last name on Facebook to the last name of your favorite male singer. Pretty soon I was no longer Sarah Kremen; I was Sarah Bublé, a 13-year-old with a Michael Bublé obsession. It was also a trend to be &#8220;in a relationship&#8221; with one of your best friends to make it seem like you weren&#8217;t single. To this day, I am still &#8220;married&#8221; to my best friend Naomi. It&#8217;s been so for 5 years.</p>
<p>It turns out, this trend wasn&#8217;t just a trend for teenagers at South Side Middle School. In <em>It&#8217;s Complicated : The Social Lives of Networked Teens </em>by Danah Boyd, social media is a toss-up because while some teens feel the need to take it seriously and make their profile as accurate as possible to depict who they truly are, others find &#8220;playful ways&#8221; to &#8220;respond to social media sites&#8217; requests for information&#8221; (Boyd 33). An example of a &#8220;playful way&#8221; according to the text is how teens like to make their best friends their &#8220;siblings&#8221; on Facebook to show how close they are. I can relate to this because on my Facebook it says I have 6 sisters, even though I only have 1.</p>
<p>Though it is funny to fabricate information on social media, doesn&#8217;t it defeat the purpose of social media? Now that I&#8217;m no longer 13, I depend on Facebook for providing accurate information about people when I go on their profiles. For example, after I came across my roommate&#8217;s profile for the first time, I assumed that everything she established about herself was true so I wouldn&#8217;t be &#8220;catfished&#8221; in essence. Nowadays, we are becoming more reliant on social media to learn about each other, which is concerning because it is so easy to create an inaccurate depiction of yourself.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whenever I go through my home videos, I always stumble upon videos of me doing what I loved as a kid: watching TV. Barnie, The Wiggles, Blue&#8217;s Clues; you name it, I probably have watched it. Given that I was an extremely shy child, I always preferred staying at home rather than playing at the playground with my classmates. I feel that this deep-seated my love for technology.</p>
<p>This love for technology grew exponentially when I was introduced to video games. When I was about six years old, my parents bought me a Gameboy. Shortly, this hand-held gaming device never left my hands. I would use it to play games such as Pokemon, and I would also watch countless episodes of The Fairly Odd Parents on it when when traveling with no TV. I thought this gadget was the greatest invention ever. Little did I know how much I would love the Gamecube, which I got when I was seven. I was mind-blown by this gadget because it could connect to my TV and had more intricate buttons to press compared to the Gameboy. By then, I was <strong>hooked.</strong> I had a daily routine of getting up 2-3 hours before I had to go to school so I could play my favorite games, such as Monkeyball. Not only that, but as soon as I would get home from school, I would run straight to my Gamecube to play some more. It didn&#8217;t take long for my parents to realize that I had an unhealthy obsession. I was distraught when they had to restrain me from playing for so many hours a day, but now I am thankful that they did so because I became more focused on schoolwork and playing with my friends.</p>
<p>My technology obsession took a hiatus for a while until I got a Wii when I was ten. This Christmas gift was the greatest thing ever because not only was it a gadget that required motion, but it had adapters for Gamecube users so that I could still play my Gamecube games. It was like I had the best of both worlds! My favorite game was Guitar Hero III. That year I had attempted to learn how to play the guitar, but I gave up rather quickly because it was too challenging. Playing Guitar Hero brought out my inner guitar player wannabe. Guitar Hero taught me what determination feels like; I was not going to stop until I reached the expert level. Once I reached my goal, I felt so accomplished that I couldn&#8217;t help but gloat to my friends.</p>
<p>My constant texting habit that I still have today dates back to my first phone that I got for my 11th birthday. I thought I was hooked when it came to my Gameboy, but I was 10 times more hooked to my phone. It never left my sight (unless if my parents took it away). Nowadays I haven&#8217;t changed much, but I am more aware about how much of a distraction phones are so I try my best to focus on more important things. I feel that my obsession with technology for almost my whole life exposes my shyness because it has always been an outlet of entertainment when I feel bored or lonely, rather than conversing with people face-to-face. Sometimes, I wish I was like Brian O&#8217;Neill in &#8220;Teens Who Say No To Social Media&#8221; by Christine Rosen because he &#8220;doesn&#8217;t need social media to stay in touch&#8221; (Rosen 2016). Without social media, I would feel out of the loop because almost all of my friends post what is going on in their lives on a daily basis. Sometimes I miss the days before I started using social media because I didn&#8217;t feel stressed over how many likes I got on a picture that I posted. I do recognize that this is a silly thing to stress about because &#8216;likes&#8217; don&#8217;t matter, but I have yet to completely stop caring and worrying about it. Though I do feel satisfied when I do get a lot of likes, it unfortunately shows how much I care about what others think about me, and I should only focus on how I think about myself.</p>
