								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The concepts of identity, self-promotion, and manipulation of an intended audience are significant aspects of the Twitter world. Users have become addicted to the “micro-celebrity” (Marwick 121) social status and are feeding off of their, “audience that they can strategically maintain through ongoing communication and interaction” (Marwick 121). It’s interesting to see the different goals that each Twitter user has in mind when posting tweets for the public to see. Some users, such as giant corporations, use specific marketing tactics to manipulate users and appeal to a niche’s specific interests. “Soraya Darabi, the social media strategist for the New York Times, said, ‘I’m constantly aware of my followers.’” (Marwick 126) She is the perfect example of what it looks like to have an inauthentic goal in mind when tweeting, for she creates an explicit social image for the sole purpose of gaining followers and possible fiscal rewards. Soraya Darabi does not use Twitter for her own personal self expression, her decision, “to reveal personal information”, is, “strategic, and often framed as a way to reinforce relationships with followers” (Marwick 127). This contrasts with individuals who do not have a lot of followers because their “audience awareness”, does not, “factor greatly into their writing” (Marwick 116). Twitter users who do not have many followers “see Twitter as a personal space” (Marwick 124), in which authenticity is maintained and balanced with impression management.</p>
<p>The audience also plays a large role in the kinds of tweets produced. Since users can not actually comprehend the extent of their audience, “a tweets actual readers differ from its producer’s imagined audience” (Marwick 117). Between other social platforms that allow the share feature, tweets can be seen on countless, “communication channels” (Marwick 117), which can be daunting to the Twitter user but also be used to one’s advantage. There are many different perspectives on the kinds of tweets on the internet. Factors such as censorship, the intended audience, and the appeal to multiple audiences are all taken into consideration while tweeting. This is important to Twitter users because they do not want to be chastised for a specific tweet that was posted but then shared to an unintended audience that does not agree with the user’s views.</p>
<p>While the knowledge of having an intended audience is very important for successful Twitter users, the ability to navigate multiple twitter communities also comes into play when focusing on identity. The phenomenon of context collapse describes how the requirement to display a, “verifiable, singular identity makes it impossible to differ self-presentation strategies, creating tension as diverse groups of people flock to social network sites (boyd, 2008)” (Marwick 122). The public can not tell the difference between self-promotion and commercialization versus one’s authentic self and personal expression. Erving Goffman highlights the interesting analogy between twitter users and actors, for each tweet is a performance intended for a specific audience and group of people, especially noting the fact that, “self-presentation is collaborative” (Marwick 123). Just the way an actor can not perform without an audience, a twitter user can not post a tweet without a group of people to see and interact with it. This public presentation of various narrative can lead to criticism, “encourage social norms” (Marwick 123), and provoke an unwanted reputation for a given user. These consequences of tweeting reinforce the idea of, “’impression management’” (Marwick 123), but also sheds a light on the relationship between social media and identity and how people can accidentally create an unwanted identity for themselves.</p>
