					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;The first key point is (&quot;My understanding of ownership is that something belongs to me. That I have already acquired it or been gifted it.&quot;) I think this is a very philosophical sentence. A person born with not come to anything, dead with not take anything. That is person. And the second point is (&quot;To own is to possess. To own is to have authority and control. It implies a responsibility. Ownership is a legal designation; but it’s something more than that too. It’s something more and then, without legal protection, the word also means something less.&quot;)This sentence is easy to understand, the former section tells me that your own things are protected by law, others can not steal your things, for example, if your final article is  misappropriated by someone else, you can take back your rights by law. The latter part of the story is that, as this article says, some ownership can be given to your successor by law, but some do not. The last one is (&quot;You don’t own the movies you watch via Netflix; again, it’s a subscription and unlike a print magazine subscription, once you stop paying the bill, you won’t have stacks of old copies lying about.&quot;) The items on the network are virtual, it is not real, you may have it, but not completely owned. Online items will disappear when time is over, at the same time you have no ownership.&lt;/p&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;“My understanding of ownership is that something belongs to me. That I have already acquired it or been gifted it” (Watters, 2016) I think that we can all agree with this statement of what ownership is. Throughout this article there were many interesting points made. Firstly, the idea that the domain is not owned but it is leased. Watters quotes, “the “domain of one’s own” isn’t owned; it’s leased,” (Watters, 2016). I think this is an important because people believe that they are just leasing the apart of the domain. Thinking about the internet in terms of real estate makes the terminology behind the internet a little bit easier to understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, Terms of Agreement is something important to discuss, because many people usually overlook these pages that take about 20 minutes to read, but people just do not have the time. If people took the time to read these agreements- people would notice how much control that domain truly has over your accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, “When it comes to all our digital data, the answer to the question “what do you own” is probably “not much.” You do not own your Amazon Kindle books; you’ve purchased a license to access the content” (Watters, 2016). This quote, shows the importance of understanding just how much we really own on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the idea of property and ownership of domains is strongly discussed in this article. The idea of what we truly own and what we “lease” from other domains and the internet is entirely different. The article describes what we own and what we lease is entirely different. She also mentions Terms of Agreement. Terms of Agreement is something we should always read but we usually neglect to because of how long it is but we should take some time to skim it because it could give us a better glance into our property on the internet. What we own versus what we think we own, what we own versus what we are leasing. I think that this an incredibly important idea to understand.&lt;/p&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;The three key points I derived from the article are:
1.&quot;Part of our discussion revolved around what people are most lacking that prevents them from fully using their domains. The time and space to write? Or is it something deeper than that--the need for a place to write and create without fear&quot;
I think this point is very interesting that the writer point out the most basic thing for people to domain themselves  so that they can do better in their writing is not the time and space to write, it&#039;s a safety and security atmosphere for people to write.
2.&quot;In part, I think we resist through education; we help students and scholars understand how new digital technology work, how these technologies shape and reshape and are shaped by culture politics, money, and law.&quot;
When we realize that we own almost nothing in the digital world, the writer tells us that we can resist this situation through education, and in the later of the article, the writer points out that we can challenge how the Web and the Internet work to change our digital ownership.
3.&quot;The &quot;domain of one&#039;s own&quot; isn&#039;t owned; it&#039;s leased, Maha contends.But when one controls--albeit temporarily--a domain name and a bit of server space, I contend, we act in resistance to an Internet culture and an Internet technology and an Internet business model in which we control little to nothing. We own little to nothing&quot;
The writer uses lease instead of own to point out our situation on digital ownership--almost nothing. And the writer also gives some examples in the article later: we do not own our Amazon kindle books, we do not own the movies we watch.......because all of these can&#039;t pass to our heirs.&lt;/p&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;That line you pointed out (&quot;But you&#039;re free...you&#039;re free from owning&quot; (Watters)), stuck out to me, too. It seems a little out of place in the article, even though she&#039;s putting it with the words of companies convincing us that borrowing is better. Throughout the article, it seems she&#039;s saying that, as Sarah mentioned, we&#039;re being tricked into thinking we own things, and that desire to own is what companies use to have us buy from them. She writes about wanting people to be able to own things, especially when she said we need to &quot;help people understand the fragility of their digital data, the gnawing away at ownership and at (individual and collective) memory.&quot; But that line about being free from owning makes is sound like being tied to owning objects and data is a negative thing. Although she is putting it with other things &quot;we&#039;re told,&quot; as if they&#039;re all lies and distracting us from the truth, the sentence itself makes it sound like a positive side to the &quot;post-ownership society&quot; she contends, especially because she emphasizes &quot;you&#039;re free.&quot; Is this a benefit to a society that doesn&#039;t actually own many things we used to? Yet if we believe we do own them, how can it be?&lt;/p&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;This is a really good point to bring up. There&#039;s always something we gain from experiences, that adds to our whole self and worldview and does get passed on. I wonder how this changes the meaning of the songs and movies and things that we don&#039;t actually own because they&#039;re online and so can&#039;t physically be passed on. To those we pass our knowledge to, we give an interpretation of the knowledge, too, but not the original source for them to form opinions on.&lt;/p&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;The point you brought up about the Virginia Woolf quote is very interesting, especially that you and the author both agree it&#039;s excluding a lot of people from the field of writing. The author connected it to the idea of owning domains. I&#039;m wondering if it has any truth today in other ways, too--we can write if we just have a paper and a pen or a computer to type on, but what if people don&#039;t have a computer? They could still write, and use public computers, but with online publishing being so big and contact with publishers going through online venues, it might make it difficult for someone to bring their writing to a broader audience if they do not own the means to &quot;own&quot; something online. Although this probably isn&#039;t the same intention Virginia Woolf had when she wrote &quot;A Room of One&#039;s Own,&quot; maybe it can apply this way in this conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Three key points that I found to be important to this article is &quot;To own is to possess. To own is to have authority and control. To own is to acknowledge. It implies a responsibility. Ownership is a legal designation; but it’s something more than that too. It’s something more and then, without legal protection, the word also means something less.&quot;  I believe this part of the article is important because this article discusses ownership, and what is ownership and what isn&#039;t ownership.  This part really spells out what ownership is, and how ownership a much deeper term than people think.  Another key point I found was &quot;When it comes to all our digital data, the answer to the question “what do you own” is probably “not much.” You do not own your Amazon Kindle books; you’ve purchased a license to access the content. Your heirs will not inherit your digital reading library. You do not own the music you stream; you’ve paid for a subscription. Your heirs will not inherit your digital music library.&quot;  I found this part to be interesting because although you think that you own the stuff you by, you actually do not own it.  Like it said in the article, you do not own the music you listen to, you just pay to listen to it.  Therefore, although you possess things, it does not necessarily mean that you own them.  Lastly, the last point I found interesting was &quot;You just rent. You just borrow. You just subscribe. You just share. You owe, not own. You work, but part-time. You work, but freelance. Everything is contingent; all aspects of life, now precarious. But you’re free… You’re free from owning.&quot;  I think this part is interesting because it really makes you think about what you own in life.  It shows that you do not own nearly as much as you think.  I think this quote is a great summary of the article because it says just that.  Although you think you own everything you possess, somebody else or something else owns it.  I found this article to be interesting for that reason itself.&lt;/p&gt;

Your heirs will not inherit your digital music library.&#8221;  I found this part to be interesting because although you think that you own the stuff you by, you actually do not own it.  Like it said in the article, you do not own the music you listen to, you just pay to listen to it.  Therefore, although you possess things, it does not necessarily mean that you own them.  Lastly, the last point I found interesting was &#8220;You just rent. You just borrow. You just subscribe. You just share. You owe, not own. You work, but part-time. You work, but freelance. Everything is contingent; all aspects of life, now precarious. But you’re free… You’re free from owning.&#8221;  I think this part is interesting because it really makes you think about what you own in life.  It shows that you do not own nearly as much as you think.  I think this quote is a great summary of the article because it says just that.  Although you think you own everything you possess, somebody else or something else owns it.  I found this article to be interesting for that reason itself.</p>
