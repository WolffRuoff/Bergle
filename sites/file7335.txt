								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are constantly being watched on the internet. There is no privacy, no matter how tight we think the security on our social media pages are. The notion of social media sites being ‘free,’ is a scam, because although they may not take our money, they take our privacy. These sites, such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Gmail all advertise the fact that users can sign up and use their services for no cost; that ‘cost’ meaning money. The real cost of using these free sites is that they have access to view everything we do while using their product. These services will track what we search, and use it as a way to advertise products to us, knowing that we will be interested in the advertisements because of our internet search history. For example, if I were to purchase clothes online, the items that I view online would appear as advertisements on my Facebook news feed; I do not think that is such a coincidence. Jim Groom helped dissect the messages that we see every day in media. He explained the concept of DOOM (Domain of One’s Own), and shared that although we may be in charge of our individual social media pages, there are other people who own our domain as well.</p>
<p>In George Orwell’s <em>1984</em>, the story focuses on the idea that ‘Big Brother’ is always watching and listening to every small detail of every person’s life. That idea was thought to be crazy, before Edward Snowden released thousands of documents revealing that the government was tracking every small detail of every person’s life, just as ‘Big Brother’ had done in <em>1984</em>. As scary of a thought it is to think that the government and sites such as Google and Facebook know almost everything about us, the truth is, we bring it upon ourselves. When we sign up for media sites, we tend to enter a lot of personal information. It is frightening, but all of our personal information is on the internet, whether we like it or not. We have essentially given ‘Big Brother’ every small detail about our lives just through social media. Pun intended, we are all DOOMed.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The concept of google as a whole has always been fascinating to me. You can have access to all of the information in the world at any time. However through this activity i began to realize the differences in the type of information one would search for. For example , as an active member on social media, it would be safe to assume that I could find myself on google. Also as an athlete I thought there might be some information on me. When I actually googled myself there was thousands of pictures of different Rosie Martins.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When I put more specific information into the search category I noticed that more information came up. For example Rosie Martin Ramapo basketball had more information about me personally. This brings me into my first category of information which is more personal information.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>With personal information unless you are famous there will be little to no information about your personal life unless you are very specific. This means that anyone who googles me will basically have no concept of who I am. Just out of curiosity I decided to google something completely random that probably not many people really would google. I picked Arbor day. Thousands upon thousands of articles came up about arbor day. However when I typed in a specific foundation on arbor day less information came up. To summarize what I learned through googling myself is that with personal information it is better to google specific topics. In general information it is better to keep the searches general to obtain more articles. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> One thing that I also noticed was that the more successful a person was meant the more information they have about themselves on google. In my free write I wrote about how in order to be successful I wanted to have a great job and a happy life. In actuality I think the true measure of success to have done something great enough for people to be able to google it. I also think that having this google identity will immediately change people’s perceptions or first impressions of you. For example I said before how if you googled me nothing would come up. Now when people google me they would be able to find something great and this would mean that I would have done something to<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>become successful.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span lang="EN-US">In today’s internet community, not only famous people, but also normal people can be seen by the public through search engines or some social media. And the thing we should do first in this open community is to try to know what other people see through my social media accounts. So I use an afternoon to pretend I am a stranger and searching information through Google to try to know a person named JiahuiHuang. First of all, I entered the name JiahuiHuang in the Google engine to see if something shows. But the result really disappointed me, no matter if I click on ALL, Images, or Videos, the only place I can find myself is the LinkedIn—I am the eighteenth in line. To have a more accurate result, I also tried to search my information from other search engines like Bing and DuckDuckGo, though the messages they showed are different, I can’t find more information about myself. I started to think if my mother tongue is not English, and I stayed in a country that speak Chinese in my past eighteen years that would influence the result. So I searched my information in Google again, but this time in Chinese. Again, I found nothing, because so many people in China are named JiahuiHuang and I am not famous. Then I added some key words during the searching like my primary school. Excellent, I finally found a few things about myself during this searching—some writings that were awarded and some other award certificates at my primary school, and no more can be found.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Why do I have so little information in the internet? Few reasons</span><span lang="EN-US">: </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">1. I am not famous</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">2. I am not a person who is outstanding—famous in a particular field, won some special award or had some special achievements.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">3. I am kind of a person that out of the online social community, I post nothing and sometimes I use a pseudonym in some social media such as Facebook and Instagram.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Is it a great thing that others will have a hard time to find my real information through the network? From a security and privacy perspective, yes! But in my heart, I will feel uncomfortable that others can’t find something about me, because this proves I am not an outstanding person. In the future, though I will still not post something about myself, I hope others can find more about me through searching in Google. And what I hope to be seen in the future network in five years is something like this: JiahuiHuang, an outstanding student who used to study in Muhlenberg; Stanford student, JiahuiHuang, assists the professor in the important study of a subject; JiahuiHuang, reports an essay in a scientific magazine… </span></p>

Interestingly, each time I did it was it was with the expectation of hoping to see some stats about a sporting event I recently played in. I expected to read about my sports accomplishments.<span id="yiv2340228953yui_3_16_0_1_1476194798227_2670">  </span>Candidly speaking, I was focused on simply being mentioned since with each published stat my popularity rose amongst my peers and in sports circles.<span id="yiv2340228953yui_3_16_0_1_1476194798227_2671">  </span>With each new sporting event came more name recognition, photos and videos.

Admittedly, each new post helped fuel my self-confidence, motivation and competitive edge. The posts provided positive reinforcement for me and I sough them out. Yes, there was a site here or there that talked about other things such as scholarships received or community projects but for the most part is was all about sports. <span id="yiv2340228953yui_3_16_0_1_1476194798227_2678"> </span>I have managed to keep my private live just that –private&#8211;and I hope to keep it that way.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In googling myself, I came across many things that weren&#8217;t me. I typed &#8220;Matthew Stark&#8221; directly into Google using a private window to minimize tracking. I apparently have a Wikipedia page and many Facebook accounts. These are not me because I do not have Facebook and I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m quite famous enough to have a Wikipedia page dedicated solely to me. It might also help that I&#8217;m not a civil rights activist born in 1930.</p>
<p>The amount of content on the page is low but that is to be expected because I doubt anyone googles me/him. Another thing I found that is embarrassing in a way is a doctor of the same name from Oregon. According to <em>Health Grades, Inc.</em> (<a href="https://www.healthgrades.com/provider/matthew-stark-gj2jw">link</a> to page), he&#8217;s rated 1 star. This guy comes up 5th on Google (not including the images section) and, as one customer put it, &#8220;[h]<span>e rushes through the visit, dismisses complaints and obviously doesn&#8217;t understand the importance of patient /Doctor relationships.</span>&#8221; I guess my chances of moving to Oregon are gone.</p>
<p>The amount of entries that aren&#8217;t me is astounding. I couldn&#8217;t find myself because I&#8217;m probably one of the last of the 20.9 million results for my name because I don&#8217;t put anything out there on myself. I probably should get to doing that but I&#8217;m nervous to do so. I don&#8217;t want to end up not getting a job because of one social media blunder like you see in the news. By googling myself, it makes me wonder how Muhlenberg found me, if they did, online.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite going on multiple different search engines including bing and google, as well as using a computer other than my own, I was not able to find much information on myself. After scrolling through the first few pages of google, I finally found an article  that was written by my town’s newspaper regarding a community service project  I was a part of in middle school. I was quite surprised by this as I assumed my social media would pop up. Although I am careful with my privacy settings, I assumed my name on the profiles would match when with my google search ;however, that was not the case. Abby’s profile on linkedIn kept popping up but my name, abbey, did not pop up. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Confused by the lack of information that popped up, I tried typing in my full name, Abigail, instead of Abbey. Although results were still not on the first page, I did find my full name on my school’s website where they posted the honor role.  Although I may not have seen much information on myself, I still don&#8217;t know what is out there. I still don&#8217;t know what other people see as their google searches will all bring up different things. The internet is unpredictable and you have to be extra careful.  </span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Although I have Googled myself before, I never paid attention to any of the details – the articles about somebody else named Michael Ellick, the links that come up under the sub categories such as videos, news and shopping, or the pictures of other people who share the same last name as I do. All of the previous times I Googled myself, I was looking to see if I would show up on Google images after typing my name into the search bar, which I did. This time I paid attention to all of the details, and was surprised, to say the least.</p>
<p>The first few things that come up after Googling my name have nothing to do with me, but somebody else named Michael Ellick. It turns out that Michael Ellick is a former Minister, and a current Reverend at the Judson Memorial Church in New York City. The next few links took me to profiles of people named Michael Ellick on Facebook, and the Twitter account of the Minister. After clicking on ‘images’, I only found one picture of myself, which was my Twitter profile picture. I also came across a picture of my uncle, pictures that have been tweeted from my twitter account, and pictures of Michael Phelps, Michael Jordan, and the Minister Michael Ellick. I was surprised to have only seen one picture of myself. Next I clicked on ‘news,’ and was surprised. On September 23 I had been stopped on the way to one of my classes at Muhlenberg by the Lehigh Valley News, who were interviewing students about how they feel about political posts on social media. I had forgotten that I had been interviewed, so watching the interview was both exciting and nerve-racking, as I said that “I would probably unfriend them or unfollow them” (referring to people who post about politics) on camera. If I had known that they were going to post the interview online, I probably would have changed my answer, and said something a little nicer. Regardless, I am very satisfied and comfortable with what comes up when my name is entered into Google. There is nothing there that I am uncomfortable with or embarrassed about, and moving forward I will make it a habit to Google myself to assure that there continues to be nothing that can appear as negative under my name.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Everyone relies on Google and other search engines for information. And when googling someone so much information comes up about who they are and what they are doing with their lives. But, sometimes the correct person that you are looking for comes up because there is other people out there that could have the same name.</p>
<p>I have actually googled myself multiple times to look up statistics for lacrosse and other things for the recruiting process. So I had a pretty good idea of what was going to come up. As I expected most of what comes up is for lacrosse, different profiles I have created for recruiting and a statistics website that my high school is on and then my Twitter also comes up.</p>
<p>Then when I go to photos there are photos of me, some members of my family, some friends, and then photos of people that I do not know at all. There are several photos that appear from different social medias that I have. Along with photos from social media there are photos from school events that I am in or I was at the event that the photo was taken at if I am not actually in the photo. When I go to the news tab it is just articles for lacrosse and that is it. Then in videos it is also just lacrosse footage. I have never posted anything to YouTube except for my lacrosse highlight tape and I indirectly did that because it is under my name, but my dad actually posted it on there for me.</p>
<p>Nothing comes up that I am ashamed of or do not want being viewed when my name is googled so I think I have done a good job on being cautious on the Internet.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After Google-searching my full name, I discovered that I share a name with a very well known and successful neurologist at UCLA. This M.D. Sarah Kremen works at an Alzheimer&#8217;s Disease Research Center, which I find to be interesting because my grandpa Kremen has Alzheimer&#8217;s. This Sarah Kremen consumed the majority of the top results, and I didn&#8217;t find any results of myself until the second page. The second page contains both my Facebook profile and my Youtube channel. The third page contains my one video on Vimeo, one Vine that I revined, and pictures of me on my dance studio&#8217;s Pinterest. After the third page, I can&#8217;t find anymore information on me. When I click on &#8216;images&#8217;, the top photos of me that come up are my profile photos of different websites/apps and my Pinterest photos. When I click on &#8216;videos&#8217;, all of my dance teacher&#8217;s dance videos from Youtube come up because she tagged my name in the description of the videos that I am in. If someone who doesn&#8217;t know me was to search my name in the internet, they would most likely come to the conclusion that I am a passionate dancer because the majority of the photos and videos of me are dance related.</p>
<p>This digital activity made me feel reassured that there is nothing too personal or too private in the internet of myself that I wouldn&#8217;t want the public to see. When I am older and job authorities are searching my name, I am confident that they won&#8217;t find anything that would prevent me from getting that job.</p>
