<p>            The proliferation of new technology has brought to the national forefront a new form of bullying. Unlike traditional bullying, cyberbullying is a more insidious, prevalent and difficult to trace form of abuse and the number of cyberbullying incidents seem to be growing in epidemic proportions. With the burgeoning advancements in technology, people now have the ability to instantaneously communicate with others through various technological mediums&#8211;internet, text messaging, social networks, and video games. Consequently, this provides multiple forums for disseminating information and an outlet for hurling anonymous insults and harassing comments. Is there not a way to combat cyberbullying? So far, the answer seems to be no.  No one seems to be shielded from its reach.</p>
<p>Brittan Heller, the Anti-Defamation League’s first director of technology and society discusses her own personal experience, as well as, others experiences with cyberbullying in a recent article in the New York Times titled “What It’s Like to fight Online Hate” (2016). Heller, a Jewish American woman, was flooded with sexist anti-Semitic comments on her Twitter account just moments after the A.D.L announced her hire in early September. She understood that cyberbullying was prevalent in our environment today, but even she was amazed and troubled with the speed and maliciousness in which these attacks were made. Everywhere she turned she was confronted with images of swastikas taunting her about her Jewish heritage and death threats all because she was appointed to this incredibly prestigious position.</p>
<p>The mental and emotionally consequences suffered by countless numbers of cyberbullying victims are resulting long lasting effects. In today’s age technology allows a tormentor to go where bullies where afraid to go in the past. A crisis exists and it needs to be stopped.  If nothing is done soon, increasingly more and more people will be directly affected by this everyday creating a culture where you are forced to conceal your true feelings for fear of public scrutiny, ridicule and humiliation.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most people in today’s society know what cyber bullying and bullying are. Students have probably had assembly after assembly on why not to cyber bully and how it makes the person being bullied feel. However what really drew me to this article was that it was not simply a run down of why not to bully. It told the differences and similarities between the two. I thought that this was fascinating because this was information that had never really been explained to me before. I also believe that in order to try and stop something like bullying or cyberbullying you need to fully understand the two topics.</p>
<p>The biggest reason for bullying is because there is an imbalance of power. In other words bullying to me is making someone else feel small in order to make oneself feel better. This is why bullies select their victims very carefully in both cyber bullying and in normal bullying. “Both tend to target passive victims in which balance of power favors the bully”( Gale, 2016).  The character traits of the bully are also the same. “ Both involve harassment of a victim by an aggressor whose intent is to inflict harm” ( Gale, 2016). The main similarities between cyber bullying and bullying is the type of people that are bullied and the ones who bully. I found this incredibly interesting.</p>
<p>Some of the difference between bullying and cyber bullying I found quite unsettling. For example in cyber bullying people are not always sure of who their bully is. “This anonymity empowers many cyber bullies to continue antagonizing their victims” ( Gale, 2016). With bullying normal schoolyard bullying people can pinpoint exactly who is targeting them. With cyber bullying it could literally be anyone  and this is a hard pill to swallow. i cannot even imagine not even knowing who is causing trying to hurt them. This also makes the bully feel that they can’t get caught and make the threats more prevalent. With technology as well there is always access to the person. They can make threats twenty four seven. Cyber bullying is so much more dangerous than normal bullying for this reason. People get a sense of confidence behind the computer screen that is unwavering. They say things that they never would to a persons face.</p>
<p>Having now known the difference and similarities between bullying I feel i understand the topic of cyber bullying a lot more. I understand that it is not the people who are changing it is simply their access to the people being bullied that are changing. Cyberbullying is considered to be more detrimental as well. In my previous statement i concluded that it was not the people who were changing it was simply the method. If this is so its raises the question should we think of technology as more detrimental for young kids then beneficial?</p>
