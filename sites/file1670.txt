<p><em>On April 16, 2019, librarian Kelly Cannon (KC) interviewed library student employee Nely Montina about his time working at the library and how it has affected his overall Muhlenberg experience. Following is a transcript of that interview.</em></p>


<p>KC:  Okay, so my first question for you is, What&#8217;s your favorite part of working at the library? </p>



<p>Nely Montina:  My favorite part is the bond with the staff. Getting to know them, them getting to know me. The library also allows me to do work, to be a student worker. The student aspect and the work aspect. I get back to the people. Everyone&#8217;s fun. At the same time very different. Very worthwhile. Very memorable. Also, too, this is my senior year, I think about how I got here, and like wow. I got this job at June advising. I knew I wanted to be here. The fact I stayed here all four years has shown that I wanted to be here and I wanted to be in this environment. To me it&#8217;s been a fun place, a comfortable place. A welcoming place. I also like challenges. I&#8217;ve learned a lot. Like the Dewey Decimal System. What the heck is that! Then I learned that is how books are organized. Opportunities to learn. I like learning. The scavenger hunts we&#8217;re doing, it keeps you on your toes so you&#8217;re never bored. Sitting up at the front, it looks like you&#8217;re doing nothing, but you&#8217;re not. I like all of that. </p>



<p>KC:  How have your impressions of the library changed since you started? </p>



<p>Nely Montina:  It&#8217;s changed, even from the staff. Adam was here, then Stephanie came. So changes in the staff itself. Getting to know them has been interesting. The library has changed visibly, like they&#8217;re trying to meet the student needs, like the smartboard, the movable boards, that has been very important. Especially the biology students, they go crazy around those boards. The trivia nights, getting students outside the classroom. Having the candy in front of the circulation desk. The library is welcoming to students and non-student patrons as well. Despite these changes, the library has been consistent in its mission. The library is very responsive too. The library is highly collaborative. It doesn&#8217;t happen with just one person. Making the system work better and faster. I&#8217;ve seen those changes too. Improving WMS. Making that faster. Even the website has been improving, making it more accessible, making things more attractive, so people can see the resources that we have here. So yea, trying to make changes in meeting student needs that I&#8217;ve seen. </p>



<p>KC:  How has working at Trexler Library shaped your experience at Muhlenberg? </p>



<p>Nely Montina:  I see how important it is working in a place like here. I&#8217;m all about resources and getting access. You can from the view of the circulation desk see all the things that go into making the resource. Seeing the importance of the students coming up to me and looking for an article and we don&#8217;t have it but we can partner with someone to get it. Working here has also taught me to communicate with people. I&#8217;m constantly talking to people. I&#8217;m in the front. I have to get ready to answer some questions. I have to get ready to be transparent. I don&#8217;t know this, but I know someone else who knows more information about this. Being self-aware. I don&#8217;t know this much but I can access these other resources that may support you. Those are transferable skills that apply to Media Comm [my major].&nbsp; </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 400;">Gabriella Petrone ‘21</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This semester a new type of training was implemented for student workers at the library: the tech modules. When I first heard we were trying our hand at all the different pieces of technology in the library to ensure that we can explain them to patrons, I thought it was going to be a fairly simple task. I grew up with technology at my fingertips, how hard could it really be? Naturally, using the cloud-based printing system (wepa) is now second nature and was not an issue. Other modules however, such as the powerslide scanner and microfilm scanner, made me pause, causing me to follow the directions with the utmost accuracy. I definitely did not expect to complete every single task with flying colors on the first try, but I also did not expect to mess up. Multiple times. On everything from the copier to the powerslide scanner to the one button studio. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most important learning opportunities did not come from the modules that I finished quickly and efficiently, but from the ones that I had to ask my boss and coworkers about. An example of this is my experience with the one button studio. The one button studio allows you to create high quality video projects without any prior video production knowledge because with the touch of one button the lights change, and the camera records. There is also a projector available that you can use to display slideshows, and there is even a green screen you can use to take your video to the next level. The one button studio on paper seems to be the simplest task. Despite this I had issues. What I would come to learn from my coworker that day was something she had figured out herself: you need to make sure the one button studio program is open on the computer and working. I had mistakenly overlooked this step because of my attentiveness to the instructions and the simplicity of just clicking the bright blue button.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The confidence I have to explain the different technology of the library has increased because of the tech modules. Prior to completing the tech modules, if a patron needed assistance, I often had the same amount of knowledge about the tech as the patron, causing an air of uncertainty. After completing the modules, I began to have more confidence in my explanations because I had previously taken my time learning the ins and outs of the piece of technology in front of me. This new training exercise is important because it has given the lending services student workers the skills needed to explain more than just where to find a book. It is crucial that we understand and are experts on the entirety of the library so we can easily field any question that might arise.</span></p>
