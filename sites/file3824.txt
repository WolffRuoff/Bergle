<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On March 22 2011, the press released breaking news that Sirius/XM&#8217;s biggest client, Howard Stern, is suing for more money.  Although this is a quick switch from the most recent post on Clear Channel Radio, this news is important to satellite radio due to the fact that it shows an increasing producer power role that Stern holds.  Stern had renewed his <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/analyst-howard-stern-sirius-xm-58336">contract</a> in December of 2010 for five more years on Sirius/XM radio.  Being offered a spot on terrestrial radio, Stern declined because he realized the strength and growth in Sirius/XM&#8217;s distribution role.  Yet, he is suing because the money that he was to gain from the Sirius/XM stock revenue seen from subscription growth, was not paid to him.<span id="more-1005"></span></p>
<p>“When Sirius needed Stern, it promised him a share in any success that the company achieved,” the suit says. “But now that Sirius has conquered its chief competitor and acquired more than 20 million subscribers, it has reneged on its commitment to Stern, unilaterally deciding that it has paid him enough.”  Although these claims were made from stock reports in 2008/2009, this was the time when Stern did not see the monetary claims.</p>
<p>Yes, Stern obtains copious amounts of money, but his power role could be one of the reasons for saving Sirius radio after they had merged with XM radio in 2009, before reaching bankruptcy.  Not only a producer power role, Stern and his production company also play as facilitators.  They helped facilitate satellite radio with (even though the amount of listeners for Stern has not been released) audience growth from 600,000 listeners in 2009, to 60 million.  So, for Sirius/XM to lose Stern, they might possibly lose an extreme amount of listeners.  Stern left terrestrial (AM/FM) radio because of his inappropriate content (decided by the FCC), however,the FCC authority (government) power role has no control over satellite radio waves,  allowing him to talk about anything and everything, with whatever language he wanted to use.</p>
<p>Stern gained popularity through news headlines and articles about him leaving the terrestrial stations, but after that hype ended, Stern understood that satellite radio was his next move due to the fact that it had great potential for subscribers, which was a good idea on his part.  Since this court case report is so recent, there have been no conclusions as of yet, but if Sirius/XM want to continue with Stern, they will need to compromise and understand that Stern holds a big part of their power roles.</p>
