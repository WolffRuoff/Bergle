								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Snapchat has quickly become one of the leading social media sites that people use throughout their everyday lives. Although people of all ages use Snapchat, teenagers and others in their early twenties make up most of the user population. With this being the case, the NBA and NFL among other professional sports leagues have decided to bring their own featured content for the users of Snapchat to watch. On days when there is an important sporting event going on such as the MLB playoffs or NBA finals, Snapchat will let users that attend any of these events post real time videos from their phones to the events “My Story”. Snapchat users from all around the world can then watch these snaps in real time to witness the plays and sounds of each event. Snapchat is proving to be the place where teens and other users can get videos and photos that take them closer to sports. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The article that I read discussed why sports fans are using Snapchat for their sports content as opposed to other social media sites such as Facebook or Twitter. Based on my encounters with each of these apps, Snapchat is more easily navigable than any other social media site. While Facebook or Twitter might have one video of a touchdown or amazing play, Snapchat usually has well over 100 seconds of footage if the sporting event has a My Story. With one click of the button short clips of pre-game tailgates,national anthem, fans cheering in the stands, and plays from the game come across the screen without any clicking out or loading another video. With teenagers being labeled as impatient, Snapchat fits the mold perfectly as it is the most effective and quickest way to make yourself feel closer to the actual events of each sport. The article considers that unpredictability is a reason that fans use Snapchat as opposed to Twitter or Facebook. Sports can take a turn in a matter of seconds and one play can change the whole game. The author says that, “the ephemerality of the platform can be alluring. In contrast to Facebook, Twitter, or other social media platforms where a post can live forever, one can cheer when your team scores without worrying about looking dumb if they end up losing,” (Constine, 2014, p.1). On social media websites like Twitter or Facebook, users usually wait until after the event is over to post celebratory things about their teams win because they do not want to jinx or speak too soon. Snapchat is an app that lets people show events happening in real time so this problem does not occur. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With Snapchat being occupied by teenagers and people in their twenties, it will continue to be at the forefront of social media usage and maybe even surpass sites like Twitter and Facebook. Teenagers look to Snapchat and will continue to look to Snapchat to keep up to date with sporting events. With the success that Snapchat has had with leagues like the MLB, NBA, or NFL, it will be only a matter of time before others start showing their content to the users of Snapchat. </span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the ever evolving world today, teens have become so accustomed to the presence and use of technology in their day to day lives. With the existence of technology, comes the ever-growing want and need of two top priorities: to be connected to friends, family, and strangers around the world and to have one’s privacy remain intact while doing so. In July 2011, the wants and needs of the aforementioned teens came true via the release of Snapchat. The app was created by Evan Spiegel, Bobby Murphy, and Reggie Brown as a requirement for a course at Stanford University (“Snapchat,” 2015).  The app’s platform encourages users to send candid pictures of whatever it is that they are doing in that moment. The unsaved photos are then sent to user’s friends and are deleted after a maximum of ten seconds which is set by the sender. Although this form of social media sounds utopic, are teens relying so heavily on the assumption that the pictures are deleted forever that they let their guard down? The answer is yes.</p>
<p>An increased sense of privacy is typically accompanied by an increased sense of indestructibility. Within the four years that Snapchat has been up and running, sexting has become overwhelmingly popular because users believe that once the content disappears after the time limit expires, it is gone forever (“Snapchat,” 2015). Contrary to popular belief, Snapchat’s main privacy page states that “there may be ways to access messages while still in temporary storage on recipients’ devices or, forensically, even after they are deleted (“Privacy Policy,” 2014).” Therefore, users of Snapchat are being deceived by themselves. By not knowing the full parameters of the app, one is acting in ways that they would not if they did not believe the app was private. The fact that this not-really-private-privacy is not hidden but rather in regular sized text on the main webpage of Snapchat, shows that teens are not looking carefully at what they are agreeing to when signing up for an account. Consequently, I believe that teens today allow themselves to get into the trouble that they are getting in because they are too quick to believe what they want to be true.</p>
