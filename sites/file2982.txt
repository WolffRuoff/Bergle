		<p>The Ha&#8217;Penny Bridge:</p>
<p><iframe width="654" height="491" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/59wqZ8Dr-uE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The main purpose of a bridge is for someone to get from Point A to Point B over a small body of water.  In Ireland’s capital city of Dublin, the River Liffey runs through the city, dividing the North side from the South side.  Therefore, many bridges have been built over the years to transport Dubliners from one side to the other. The historic Ha’Penny Bridge located in downtown Dublin has been getting Dubliners and other visitors over the river since 1816.  Originally named The Wellington Bridge, after the Duke of Wellington, when it opened in 1816, it is officially named The Liffey Bridge. However, despite these two names, it is best known as The Ha’Penny Bridge. The pedestrian bridge gained this name from the half penny toll that was required to cross the bridge for the first 100 years of its existence.  There was even a time in the early 1900s when the toll was increased to a “penny-ha’penny”, requiring Dubliners to pay a cent and a half to cross the river. Today, it is free to cross the bridge. For some, crossing this bridge is part of their daily commute, while for others it is one of Dublin’s many historic sites where tourists come to take photos and eventually make their way into the famous Temple Bar area when they cross to the South side of the River Liffey.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While on the bridge, we observed many people making their way across in both directions, minding their own business as if it was their everyday routine.  Meanwhile, others stopped for photos of the bridge and of themselves on the bridge. Furthermore, we were two of the people on the bridge for the purposes of taking photos and videos of it, rather than just simply crossing it.  The use of mobile media was seen by ourselves, as well as by other tourists using their smartphones to document their experience on the bridge. Additionally, the people simply making their way across the bridge were seen using mobile media whether they were talking or texting on their phone while walking, or using it with headphones to listen to music.  One woman in particular that can be seen in our video spends a lot of time taking photos of herself and of the bridge using her smartphone. It was obvious that her intention for being there was not to just cross the bridge, but rather to document her experience at a historic Dublin site. Another example seen in our video is of two people visiting the bridge, where the one person is taking photos of the other person standing on the bridge.  Similar to the woman by herself taking photos, two people can be seen on the bridge for the purpose of documenting their experience in this location. Thinking about this through the black box theory, we do not know if these tourists are aware of the history behind the bridge, therefore “black boxing” the concept that it cost a half penny to cross the bridge. It is likely that most tourists do not consider this during their time on the bridge as they are caught up in documenting themselves in a picturesque Dublin scenery, using their smartphones to do so, also “black boxing” these objects.  Along with these tourists, we also not aware of the history behind Ha’Penny Bridge; it was not until filming and doing research that we realized the significance behind the name of this historic tourist attraction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While the bridge is just physical place in the geographic location of Dublin, it also represents a larger network of humans interacting with mobile media.  Whether people use their mobile devices to navigate themselves over the bridge, document photos and videos, or simply talk with others they may be meeting on the other side of the river, mobile media has a presence in this historic Dublin site.</span></p>

<p>Ayanna&#8217;s Interview:</p>
<p>The theory of domestication helps us gain an understanding of how technologies become integrated into people’s everyday lives and as a result, how they shape and alter people’s everyday behaviors.  The theory focuses on the role technologies play in people’s daily lives (Bartel, 2017, p.83).  One form of modern technology that has become heavily integrated into people’s everyday lives is the smartphone.  Through domestication theory, it can be studied how people’s smartphones have shaped their daily lives and behaviors.  One way to observe this is through interviewing a smartphone user to gain a better understanding of where, why, when, and how they use their smartphones on a daily basis.  In an interview with my partner, Ayanna Costley, she discusses the way in which she utilizes her smartphone.</p>
<p><strong>Situations of everyday life:</strong>  In the first part of the interview, Ayanna answered some general questions about her smartphone usage.  She claimed that she basically uses her smartphone all day, everyday.  In the morning it is the first thing she interacts with because it acts as her alarm clock.  After turning off her alarm clock, she checks social media such as Twitter and Snapchat, and also replies to any messages she received while she was sleeping.  Then, she proceeds to use it throughout the day for various uses that she discusses deeper, later in the interview.  Ayanna mentions that she checks her phone frequently throughout the day to check to see if she received any notifications.  When she downloaded the application “Moment” for our class assignment, the application told her that she checked her phone about 60 times a day.  Before she goes to bed at night is when she uses her phone the most.  She checks all her social media and sends messages to friends and family before going to bed.</p>
<p>In this first part of the interview, it is revealed how her smartphone shapes behaviors in her everyday life.  From the moment she wakes up in the morning, her smartphone is central to what she does for the rest of the day.  It can be seen through domestication theory how big of a role a smartphone plays in Ayanna’s daily routine.  She starts and ends her day by using it, and checks it and uses it for various uses throughout the day.</p>
<p><strong>Individual dimensions:  </strong>In the second part of the interview, Ayanna goes more in depth about her smartphone usage as she discusses specific applications she uses most frequently and specific scenarios she has used her phone in.  She states that she uses her Messages/Facebook Messenger application, Music, and Twitter the most on her smartphone.  These applications are the most important to her because Messages/Facebook Messenger allows her to stay connected to friends and family, which has been especially important since being here in Ireland.  She uses Music frequently in her down time, especially here in Ireland when she is spending time in her common room.  Twitter allows her to stay connected to friends and also allows her to build a network in the film industry where she hopes to have a career one day.  When I asked Ayanna about a memorable story involving her smartphone, she told me about a time in boarding school where she got hurt and had to go to the hospital.  She was using her phone to call her parents about 20 times because she couldn’t get through to them for some reason.  In the end she called her uncle who then was able to contact her parents to let them know she was okay.</p>
<p>This part of the interview with Ayanna revealed more details about her smartphone usage and how specifically it gets integrated into her life.  It can be seen how the applications she uses most frequently shapes her everyday behavior, simply by shaping how she communicates and connects with others through the applications available on the smartphone.  Her smartphone also provides ways in which to fill her downtime, such as playing music.  In the story she told about getting hurt at boarding school, her phone played a major role in the entire situation because her phone was the way in which she would let her parents know she was alright, which was a very important aspect of the situation as a whole.</p>
<p><strong>Malleability:  </strong>In part three of the interview, Ayanna discusses the organization and appearance of her smartphone.  She talks about how she organizes her applications on her screen by putting the ones she uses most on her first screen, and arranging them all by color in rainbow order from top to bottom so that she can find what she’s looking for quickly and easily.  On the bottom of the screen, the four applications that are always there no matter which screen page she’s on is her Messages, Phone, Safari, and Music, so that she always has access to them.  As far as the appearance of her phone, she typically has a wallpaper that is a photo of her and her friends, and she has a clear case because she likes the unique red color of her iPhone.</p>
<p>In this part of the interview, it can be seen how her smartphone is a reflection of her personality and the way in which she likes to arrange things in her life.  It is part of her identity because it showcases personal things such as photos of her and her friends, as well as the applications she uses daily and the unique way in which she organizes them.</p>
<p><strong>Social connections:  </strong>In the final part of the interview, Ayanna discusses the important role her smartphone plays in connecting her with others.  As she mentioned earlier in the interview, some of her most used applications are the ones that allows her to connect with others.  These applications keep her connected to family and friends no matter where she is or what she is doing, which has always been very important to her but has become even more important since being in Ireland.  She connects with immediate family members and close friends most frequently through her smartphone, whether it’s through Messages/Facebook Messenger, which is what she uses most commonly, FaceTime, or normal phone calls.</p>
<p>The final part of the interview reveals that for Ayanna, the communication tools offered by her smartphone is what is most important to her when it comes to her smartphone, which interestingly enough is what a phone was originally intended to do, however, today’s phones allow us to communicate in various ways plus do many other things with the phone as well.  Through domestication theory it can be seen how heavily Ayanna’s phone is integrated into her life and how it plays a central role in her day to day activities.  Her smartphone shapes her communication behaviors, as well as many other behaviors such as filling her downtime and creating networks for future careers all through one single device – her iPhone.</p>

<p>Nicole&#8217;s Interview:</p>
<p>As a theoretical framework, domestication theory functions as a tool to help us understand how media technologies, such as the mobile phone, are implemented into our daily lives. Domestication theory is user-centered: I<span style="font-size: 14px">t focuses on how individuals or groups of people, children as opposed to adults for example, engage with different types of mobile technologies through a consideration of the specific uses/appropriation. The following is a study/analysis of mobile technologies, mainly the smart phone, in Nicole’s life using domestication theory. When she first wakes up in the morning, Nicole’s phone functions as an alarm clock—in other words, waking her up as it wakes itself up. While she does u</span><span style="font-size: 14px">se her smartphone throughout the entirety of her day, she typically uses her phone more during the evening time. After some thought she attributed this realization to the fact that it is easier and more convenient to talk</span><span style="font-size: 14px">to friends/family back in the States because it’ll usually be their afternoon time. She also mentioned that she tends to use her phone most at night because this is a time where she can catch up on all of the notifications and general things she missed, especially if she did not use her phone too much that day. This accounts for a lot of her screen time each day. The specific functions/apps she uses daily on her smartphone are: alarm clock, music app, maps, Snapchat, Instagram, and iMessages. As mentioned before, the alarm clock is vital because it wakes her up/keeps her on schedule. Music allows her to browse new releases and listen to her favorite songs while getting ready, on the bus, etc. Apps like Snapchat, Instagram and iMessage enable Nicole to connect to friends, family and pop culture as a whole. She can share pictures/videos from her daily experiences here in Dublin with those back at home and also engage with other’s digital lives from these apps. A few weeks ago she was on the bus coming bac</span><span style="font-size: 14px">k to DCU, her phone dried its battery and died. Because she</span><span style="font-size: 14px">was already on the bus and knew which stop to get off of, she did not necessarily need her phone for Maps. However she was always used to having her phone on to entertain her or keep her busy while on a bus ride. So, on this bus ride while her phone was dead she observed that other riders were on their phone and that his was a normal thing to do. She probably would not have noticed this if she was also on her phone. Nicole described the arrangement of apps of her phone in terms of most used functions. At the bottom of her screen she usually has the iMessage app, phone app and mail app for easy access to being able to connect and respond with others. In terms of phone custo</span><span style="font-size: 14px">mization, she has a plain black phone case and usually uses a photo of her and her friends as her background screensaver. For security purposes, she uses both a passcode and fingerprint to unlock her phone. Nicole’s mobile smartphone is extremely important to he social connections with others. Without it, she would find it hard and next to impossible to</span><span style="font-size: 14px">seamlessly and wackily connect and engage with friends/family back at home. Her phone is not only plays a significant role in connecting to others but also to connecting to place and the world around her. Because we are living in a brand new place and traveling to different places around Europe, Nicole would find it hard to safely “connect” to new places without her phone. Without it she would not be able to call/text someone in case of an emergency or even us</span><span style="font-size: 14px">e the Maps app to locate her and offer directions. Right now, she contacts friends and family most via mobile media because she is so far away from them. She uses a combination of mobile media technologie</span><span style="font-size: 14px">s to contact them, including iMessage and FaceTime, in addition to social media like Instagram and Snapchat. Nicole is a great study for how domestication of mobile media can take place. Her examples prove that technology can and will be integrated into everyday life. This can change and adapt, for example, as Nicole primarily uses her phone at night time to communicate with people in a different time</span><span style="font-size: 14px">zone. If she were home in the States, this might not necessarily be true. Nicole’s use of her smartphone also tak</span><span style="font-size: 14px">es into account situational contexts. The placement of her phone (usually next to her/ always within reach), the time she uses it and how/where she uses it are all important to understand the appropriation, objecti</span><span style="font-size: 14px">fication, incorporation and co</span><span style="font-size: 14px">nversion of d</span><span style="font-size: 14px">omestication (</span><span style="font-size: 14px">becoming part of everyday social connections/interactions.  </span><span style="font-size: 14px">   </span><img class=" wp-image-134 aligncenter" style="font-size: 1.4rem;font-style: inherit;font-weight: inherit" src="http://mobilemedia.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2018/03/unnamed-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="239" height="319" srcset="http://mobilemedia.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2018/03/unnamed-225x300.jpg 225w, http://mobilemedia.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2018/03/unnamed-768x1024.jpg 768w, http://mobilemedia.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2018/03/unnamed-1x1.jpg 1w" sizes="(max-width: 239px) 100vw, 239px" /></p>
