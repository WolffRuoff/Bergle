					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I never would have thought about the idea of self image through our apps. Although it makes perfect sense and I know I play around with my apps all the time to make it look cute and appealing. Maybe that time focused on worrying about likes or how our phones may look to others should be focused on self reflection like you mentioned. Before college, I read a ton of articles on what to bring and what to make sure you do at school to have a successful year. One point that was mentioned was to make sure you have some time for yourself, some time where you can just relax and think. At school we are constantly surrounded by people, whether it be our roommate, people in the lunchroom or classmates. When we are alone we can easily keep busy by going on our phone. However, alone time and self reflection is a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;
