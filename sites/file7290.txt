								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In my senior year of high school, everything went digital. Every student was given an iPad that came with many educational apps. The most essential one was called eBackpack, which contains all of the worksheets and activities for each class. Every assignment was to be submitted digitally, and even some of my quizzes were digital. My grades peaked senior year, and to this day I still wonder if it is because of the iPads. Prior to senior year, I always had trouble keeping track of all of my papers. Not only was it a drag to carry a 6-pocket folder that was completely stuffed with papers, but <strong>on top of that</strong> I had to carry my notebooks and heavy textbooks. Once I got my iPad, the after school backaches went away by this environmentally friendly substitute.</p>
<p><em>Aside from saving trees, why else are technological advancements positive for educational systems? </em>Well according to Tiffani Pittman and Trudi Gaines, &#8220;technology can be an important tool used to enhance and expand the learner’s opportunities to interact with the environment by providing access to a virtual environment previously unavailable in real life and real time&#8221; (Pittman and Gaines 540). In their research study, Pittman and Gaines conducted a survey for 3rd, 4th, and 5th grade teachers in a Florida school district and concluded that there is a positive correlation between high-level technology use and &#8220;teachers’ attitudes and beliefs about the importance of technology integration and direct student access to computers within the classroom&#8221; (Pittman and Gaines 550). This conclusion is significant because it is important for teachers to be enthusiastic about integrating technology in the classroom in order to get the children to be enthusiastic.</p>
<p>Though this research is reliable, it is limited in that it doesn&#8217;t cover the negatives of technology in classrooms. One of which I found to be big senior year was that technology can be very distracting. It was very easy to make it look like you were doing work on your iPad. But in reality, you were playing Candy Crush.</p>
