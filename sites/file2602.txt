					<description><![CDATA[Clearly, the Superbowl is a critical event for the television industry, since it is really the only time during the year that television networks can count on very high ratings for a specific presentation.  The article you chose here was pretty short, which made it somewhat difficult for you to engage in a deeper analysis of it.  See if you can choose articles with a bit more substance, and those that perhaps cover multiple aspects of the business of television.  You&#039;ve focused here primarily on the distributors (e.g., the networks), but I wonder if you have found some interesting articles out there about the stations themselves (exhibitors) or the production of television (producers).  Just keep an eye out and think about how an article you may find could be indicative of larger trends in the industry.]]></description>
