Internet issues prevented further updates from Spain, but now that the team is back in the United States, here is a summary of the rest of the trip, which included a pair of shutout wins:</em></p>
<p><strong>Day 4: FC BARCELONA CAMP NOU STADIUM TOUR</strong></p>
<p>Today we visited FC Barcelona’s Camp Nou, which seats 98,000 passionate fans. I can only imagine what this place looks like when they are playing rivals Real Madrid.</p>
<p>We saw the away team’s locker room, media room, press room and the Presidential box. After the stadium tour it was time to contribute to Barca’s success by spending money in their Superstore next to the stadium. The rest of the day the team had free time in Old Barcelona City.</p>
<p><strong>Day 5: TRAINING/MONTSERRAT MONASTERY/GAME 2</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/08/msocspain_jupiter.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1337" title="Club Esportiv Jupiter" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/08/msocspain_jupiter-300x195.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="195" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/08/msocspain_jupiter-300x195.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/08/msocspain_jupiter.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Started off the morning training at UE Jupiter in a great little stadium with field turf in the middle of the city. It was a great training facility for the trip. </p>
<p>After a quick shower, we were back on the bus for a trip to Montserrat Monastery, set atop a 4,000-ft. mountain, 7 miles long and 3.5 miles wide. Montserrat is one of the most important pilgrimage spots in Spain. Thousands travel here every year to see and touch the medieval statue of La Moreneta (The Black Virgin), the patron saint of Catalonia – it is especially popular for newly married couples to seek her blessing. </p>
<p>The bus ride up to the monastery was quite interesting with the twisting and tight turns up the side of the mountain, not for those who don’t like heights. Once at the top you could go higher by taking the funicular ride up to the very top of the mountain. On a clear day you can see from the Pyrenees Mountains to the Mediterranean Sea.</p>
<p>After some hiking around the monastery it was off to our second game vs. UE Tarrega of the 3<sup>rd</sup> Division of Catalonia. Tarrega had a small, very fast turf field, built for the Spanish great first touch.</p>
<p>Tarrega decided to start some of their younger players (similar age to our players), a decision that I’m sure their coach regrets. We jumped all over them with two set piece goals in the middle part of the first half.</p>
<p>Our first goal came off a corner kick with a feed to the feet of Danny Way, who calmly placed the ball in the corner of the net to take a 1-0 lead. Our second goal came minutes later when Bucky Aronoff struck a beautiful direct kick into the box to the onrushing Cody Antonini, who headed the ball into the back of the net. </p>
<p>Jas Chojnowski made some big saves to keep the score 2-0 heading into half.</p>
<p>The second half was a different story as a whole new Tarrega lineup came out. We found out afterwards that these players where their actual starters.</p>
<p>You could tell immediately they were at a higher level and put us under immediate pressure for the first 15-20 minutes of the second half. We weathered the storm and ended up picking up a third goal late in the game off a PK, after Jeff Reinhart was fouled in the box while going to the goal. Antonini slotted home the PK for his second of the game to kill the game off. </p>
<p>A very good victory for the Mules and first on Spanish soil. We found out the next day that Tarrega club members were tweeting about the game and result! </p>
<p><strong>Day 6: TRAINING/SITGES MEDITERRANEAN RESORT TOWN</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/08/msocspain_training.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1338" title="training with FC Espanyol coach" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/08/msocspain_training-300x210.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="210" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/08/msocspain_training-300x210.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/08/msocspain_training.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>We had a morning training session with a coach from La Liga Club FC Espanyol. Jamie Fernandez Molina, who spent time in the States at Binghamton University, was our coach for the morning session. It was great to watch our squad trained by our Spanish counterpart. You could see how his training sessions reflected directly how the Spanish play soccer. </p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/08/msocspain_vball.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1335" title="volleyball at Sitges" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/08/msocspain_vball-300x245.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="245" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/08/msocspain_vball-300x245.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/08/msocspain_vball-366x300.jpg 366w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/08/msocspain_vball.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Next it was time to catch a train for a little fun at one of the Mediterranean’s most beautiful resort towns, Sitges. It was a quick 25-minute train ride down the coast to this gem of a town. Many of Barcelona’s elite, including the area’s professional soccer players, choose to make Sitges their home.</p>
<p><strong>Day 7: FIGUERES, SALVADOR DALI MUSEUM/GIRONA</strong></p>
<p>We departed for Figueres, which is known for artist Salvador Dali and his museum. We spent two hours in the museum on a self-guided tour, but you could have spent the entire day trying to make sense of his work. <a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/08/msocspain_dali.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1336" title="Dali Museum" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/08/msocspain_dali-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/08/msocspain_dali-225x300.jpg 225w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/08/msocspain_dali.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /></a>Very interesting to say the least. Dali built the museum around his work, making for a great tour.</p>
<p>Next we were off to Girona, which is a northern Catalan city known for its tight alleyways and river that splits the Old City from the more modern part of the city. The boys had free time to roam around the city.  </p>
<p><strong>Day 8: FUTSAL/OLD CITY FREE TIME/GAME 3</strong></p>
<p>We started the day off walking down to the local university and taking over their outdoor futsal court (a small court meant for 5v5). The court was very slick and more time was spent trying to avoid falling on your butt than was playing soccer.</p>
<p>The parents and my wife took advantage of a light morning to get out of the city for a wine-tasting tour. A tour of the winery and instruction on how they make cava (champagne) followed by some taste testing sounded like a good time to me! </p>
<p>The boys had some free time after training to find some souvenirs on La Rambla or down in the Old City.</p>
<p>Game 3 was actually a home game for us as we were playing at our training ground at UE Jupiter against Iberos FC of Madrid. Unfortunately they were no match for the Mules and we trounced Iberos 8-0.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/08/msocspain_uberos.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1339" title="Mules with Iberos FC" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/08/msocspain_uberos.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="175" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/08/msocspain_uberos.jpg 500w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/08/msocspain_uberos-300x105.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>Antonini had a couple goals, Nate Squire had a double, and Joey Roberts got in on the scoring with a very nice half volley. Goalies – Chojnowski, Nutovits and Pinto – kept a clean sheet for a second game in a row. It was a good confidence booster ending the trip thrashing the Spanish side.</p>

<p><strong>Day 9: TRAINING/BEACH/FAREWELL DINNER</strong></p>
<p>We had our last training session of the trip this morning. The boys were in good spirits after the game the previous day. We ended the training session playing in a small caged field made for 5v5 games on field turf. Even the coaches jumped in a played a bit.</p>
<p>The group had some much-needed free time to end the trip. Many of the players headed back to the beach to sport their Muhlenberg red Speedos one last time! Others went searching for souvenirs for family and friends. </p>
<p>My wife and I took time to head back to the Sagrada Familia to see the inside of the cathedral. We had been only around the outside with the squad and it looked too amazing not to see the inside of the cathedral. It did not disappoint as Gaudi designed the inside columns to look like trees branching out. Truly amazing architectural design. Words don’t do this cathedral justice. </p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/08/msocspain_food.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1340" title="Spanish cuisine" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/08/msocspain_food-257x300.jpg" alt="" width="257" height="300" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/08/msocspain_food-257x300.jpg 257w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/08/msocspain_food.jpg 325w" sizes="(max-width: 257px) 100vw, 257px" /></a>The group met up later on in the evening at a nicer restaurant off of the La Rambla strip for our farewell dinner of the trip. It was a nice evening to reflect on what we had done and seen over the last nine days. </p>
<p>I believe all enjoyed the past nine days and will forever remember the memories we made in Barcelona. I would like to thank the Attanasios (Rob &amp; Donna), Plifkas (Greg &amp; Leslie), Todd Lehman, Chris Pachuta, AJ Barnold and last but not least my wife Kristen for helping keep the boys in line and making this a wonderful trip. </p>
<p>Adios Amigos!</p>

Head coach Sean Topping sent back the following recap of the first few days:</em></p>
<p><strong>Day 1: ARRIVAL/ESPANYOL MATCH</strong></p>
<p>After a long flight from JFK<a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/08/msocspain2.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1307" title="Espanyol stadium" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/08/msocspain2.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="240" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/08/msocspain2.jpg 320w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/08/msocspain2-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /></a> to Paris and then a sprint through customs we just barely got everyone aboard our connection to Barcelona. We finally arrived at our hotel at around 3:30 p.m. … A quick shower, a quick dinner, and then we boarded the bus to go watch a friendly between Espanyol and Montpellier HSC (French champions last year). </p>
<p>It was an enjoyable match to watch, with the home team winning 2-0. The group was starting to fade during the match as many were caught falling asleep &#8230; After the match, we headed back to the hotel for some much-needed sleep.</p>
<p><strong>Day 2: GAME/LA RAMBLA</strong></p>
<p>After our much-needed sleep we were up early and off to our first match against U.E. Avia in Berga, about one hour outside Barcelona. The town of Berga was at the foot of a small mountain and was a picturesque setting. </p>
<p>The field was a tight turf field that was very fast, not good when you’re playing the Spanish, who can move the ball quickly. We quickly found out that if we give the ball away we might not see it back for a while.</p>
<p>They were a professional team in the Spanish 5 division, where all of the players are paid a bit to play while also holding full-time jobs. We struggled to get a rhythm in the first half and gave up a goal after giving the ball away outside our box. We went down 2-0 after the referee (arbitro) gave a very soft direct kick just outside our box.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1306" title="Mules with U.E. Avia" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/08/msocspain5.jpg" alt="" width="564" height="299" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/08/msocspain5.jpg 564w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/08/msocspain5-300x159.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/08/msocspain5-500x265.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 564px) 100vw, 564px" />Needless to say we were happy to hear the halftime whistle. The second half started much better as we looked more relaxed and started to have some opportunities at goal. We cut the deficit in half when Chris Royer cut the ball inside and found Danny Way over top, who controlled the ball and slid it into the far corner underneath the GK for our first goal of the trip.</p>
<p>We pressed for an equalizer but it never came and so we lost 2-1 in a well-played match by both sides.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/08/msocspain3.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1309" title="beach at Barcelona" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/08/msocspain3.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="320" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/08/msocspain3.jpg 240w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/08/msocspain3-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px" /></a>After the match we headed back to the hotel to change and then onto the metro and down to La Rambla (the main strip down to the water) for some dinner. My wife, assistant coach A.J. Barnold and I headed with some others down to check out the beach scene once arriving downtown. Needless to say the tapas food beachside did not disappoint! </p>
<p><strong>Day 3: GAUDI/OLYMPIC PARK/BEACH</strong></p>
<p>Up early once again, the team went on a quick run to FC Barcelona’s stadium Camp Nou. After a quick shower, we were back on the bus for a city tour.</p>
<p>We drove past couple of Antoni Gaudi works of art (buildings he constructed). The architecture was amazing to see! Next on thetour was a stop at Park Guell, where Gaudi built most of the buildings and infrastructure in the park with interesting benches, hallways and more.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/08/msocspain4.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1308" title="Park Guell" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/08/msocspain4.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="240" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/08/msocspain4.jpg 320w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/08/msocspain4-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /></a>Next was a stop at the famous Sagrada Familia, Gaudi’s cathedral that is still being built today and will not be finished until 2026, 100 years after his death. Back on the bus and the next stop was at the 1992 Olympic Stadium, where the opening and closing ceremonies took place overlooking the city. </p>
<p>The team decided it was some time for some fun and so we spent three hours today at the beach, where to my surprise a few boys got into the European spirit and wore red speedos. Tonight we will be heading back downtown for a tapas dinner.</p>

<p>The men&#8217;s soccer uniforms did not have much in the way of markings until the late 1970s. Since the mid-1990s, the kicking Mule logo has been featured prominently on the jerseys.</p>
<p>And although the uniforms may have changed over the years, the success of the program has remained constant. The Mules enter 2012 with a streak of 26 straight non-losing seasons.</p>
<p>What team do you want us to feature next Thursday?</p>

			<p><em>In celebration of the NCAA&#8217;s inaugural Division III week, we&#8217;ve had perspectives on the unique Division III experience from a <a title="Division III Week: Faculty Perspective" href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/2012/04/10/division-iii-week-faculty-perspective/">faculty member </a>and a <a title="Division III Week: Coach Perspective" href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/2012/04/11/division-iii-week-coach-perspective/">coach</a> in The MuhlBox this week.</em></p>
<p><em>But it wouldn&#8217;t be Division III without the student-athletes. So we asked a few Muhlenberg athletes what Division III meant to them.</em></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/beckhs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1059" title="Brian Beck" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/beckhs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Brian Beck, Baseball</strong></p>
<p>What playing in Division III means to me is the ability for experiences and opportunities off the field. Although throughout the year, dedication and focus for the upcoming season is key in my mind, Division III allows me the opportunity for other focuses as well. Whether it is from an engaging academic environment or the ability to pursue things such as internships during the year, Division III allows for opportunities both on and off the field, which is what you want as a student athlete.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/meolahs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1060" title="Alyssa Meola" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/meolahs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Alyssa Meola, Women&#8217;s Soccer</strong></p>
<p>Being a Division III athlete means being able to excel in academics and athletics. The great thing about playing at Muhlenberg is that I can be fully invested in soccer, as well as academics, clubs and other organizations on campus. Besides being able to participate in a variety of different activities, I love that as a Division III athlete, I&#8217;m playing with other athletes who still play because they love the game. None of us have athletic scholarships, and most of us will never get drafted to play professionally. But, we continue to play for our love of the game, which I find to be humbling. It&#8217;s exciting to look around the field, and see that you&#8217;re playing a game with all your best friends, who are working hard for each other.</p>
<p>We play Division III because we have flexibility to pursue other activities, and because we love the game, and need it in our lives because it is such a strong part of who we are, and most of us could not live without it.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/wayhs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1061" title="Danny Way" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/wayhs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Danny Way, Men&#8217;s Soccer</strong></p>
<p>I chose to play DIII after seeing what my sister went through playing at the DI level. I wanted to go to a small school that had good education, but was also very competitive with athletics. DI programs make playing a sport your job, and I wanted to have a life outside of sports. What made DIII appealing to me is that I could do other things and still have time to focus on school.</p>

			<p>In honor of Valentine&#8217;s Day, we asked a few of our student-athletes what they LOVE about being a Mule.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/02/lagomarsinohs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-822" title="Ryan Lagomarsino" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/02/lagomarsinohs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Ryan Lagomarsino (Junior, Men&#8217;s Basketball)</strong></p>
<p>First of all I love all of my Lady Mules and the relationships I&#8217;ve been able to build with them. I also love how close everyone on both teams are and how we always seem to have a good time together both on and off the court. Finally, I love the recognition we get off the court and how we always have the best and rowdiest fans, especially for our past few Saturday games. Seeing all of my friends and peers out there supporting us means the world to me.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/02/weisshs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-823" title="Jamie Weiss" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/02/weisshs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Jamie Weiss (Senior, Women&#8217;s Soccer)</strong></p>
<p>Being a student athlete allows you the opportunity to compete. It teaches you time management skills, is a great form of exercise, gives you a strong support system, and you know that you always have a friend. It gives you a great Muhlenberg experience because you get to excel in and out of the classroom setting, and allows you to experience different aspects of college life. Muhlenberg is a great tight-knit community where there are a lot of student fans who come out and support you, which is very nice!</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/02/wilsonhs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-824" title="Bryan Wilson" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/02/wilsonhs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Bryan Wilson (Junior, Football)</strong></p>
<p>The number one thing about being a Muhlenberg student-athlete, and student for that matter, is being able to work out in the Life Sports Center. The facilities are incredible, and I particularly like the fact that the weight room overlooks the football field in order to keep your ultimate goals in sight. I also really like the support staff that we have at Muhlenberg, from the coaches to the equipment room staff to the athletic trainers, and faculty and other students. It truly feels like everyone works together to be successful.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/02/lanzahs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-825" title="Leeann Lanza" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/02/lanzahs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Leeann Lanza (Sophomore, Basketball)</strong></p>
<div>What I love about being a Mule is knowing all of my fellow athletes on campus. Every team is very supportive of the others. I also love the individual team aspect. Coming to college without knowing anyone is a very scary thing and when I came to Muhlenberg as a freshman, I found it extremely easy to transition having 14 automatic friends. It can be like a family, where you&#8217;re doing things with these people all the time. Being a Lady Mule on the women&#8217;s basketball team is such a rewarding experience for me because I have met some of the most amazing people I will ever meet on or off the court. I get really excited when one coaches of the other sports knows who I am too, just because I&#8217;m an athlete. The entire athletics staff as well as professors are so supportive and it is so great to see all of the Muhlenberg pride! I have had many great opportunities through Muhlenberg in academics and athletics and I consider myself so lucky to be a student-athlete here.</div>

			<p><em>&#8220;I can&#8217;t believe I am already done with my first semester here at Muhlenberg. It seems like it was just yesterday that I was being moved into my dorm room &#8230;&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Time flies, especially when you are a busy college student-athlete. We asked several Muhlenberg freshman athletes, all of whom completed or are currently in the middle of their seasons, to write about their first-semester experiences and how they were able to adjust academically, athletically and socially. Here&#8217;s what they had to say:</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/12/dosshs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-641" title="Becca Doss" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/12/dosshs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Becca Doss, Cross Country</strong></p>
<p>Joining a team was an adjustment in itself. I went from being a top runner with the same girls for six years to being at the back of the pack on a completely new team.</p>
<p>Despite this, the team definitely made the whole college adjustment nice and smooth. The upperclassmen have been really great about showing us freshmen the wonders of Muhlenberg (like the fro-yo machine, good study spots, the cross country house, etc.). It amazes me how quickly we have become so close.</p>
<p>The commitment has really helped me with time management and keeping an academic focus. It was hard at first to see people getting ready to go out Friday nights while I stayed in to do homework. But I also chilled with teammates and it was all right because we were all in it together.</p>
<p>Even after that and after waking up early every Saturday morning, our performances were worth the sacrifices. We work really hard and have a lot of fun and are always there for each other. I wouldn’t trade the experience for anything.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/12/fiorettihs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-636" title="Krissy Fioretti" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/12/fiorettihs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Krissy Fioretti, Women&#8217;s Soccer</strong></p>
<p>When I got to school, the only thing I knew for sure was that preseason was going to be really challenging and really hot. I got recruited by other schools, but not Muhlenberg, so I didn’t know if I was even going to make the team. I didn’t really know what to expect, but I knew it would be a lot different from high school. I almost didn’t play because I was so nervous I wouldn’t like it.</p>
<p>About two weeks in, I knew I made the right choice. I love everyone on the team and am so glad I got to meet them all. We have great team chemistry led by the best captains and I couldn’t have asked to be on a better team for my first season.</p>
<p>The biggest adjustment was definitely the speed of play. I learned right away that I would have to work really hard to get used to playing at such a fast pace for the entire game. I was very excited to find out I would start on defense in the first game and for the whole season. This surprised me a lot but made me work even harder throughout the season and continue to work hard now that season is over.</p>
<p>The change to college academics was a lot less difficult than I anticipated. I have always had to balance sports and school, so it was exactly what I was used to, and my high school did a great job preparing me for college classes. I knew what to expect in them and how to organize all the work I received so I could get it done in a reasonable amount of time.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/12/gimbarhs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-638" title="Ian Gimbar" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/12/gimbarhs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Ian Gimbar, Football</strong></p>
<p>There was a huge adjustment I needed to make in terms of my academic workload. Having a busy schedule during the season actually helped me out a lot because it forced me to get as much as I could done in the time I had.</p>
<p>With football, I was very grateful to have gotten a large amount of playing time as a freshman. I had expectations of just getting on the field any way possible, but as I moved up the depth chart and some opportunities opened up, I got a chance to see some significant playing time.</p>
<p>The game is much faster and bigger than it was in high school, but in the end, it is still just football.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/12/lesherhs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-639" title="Emily Lesher" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/12/lesherhs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Emily Lesher, Women&#8217;s Basketball</strong></p>
<p>It took me a week or two in the beginning of the semester to adjust to the whole &#8220;college lifestyle.&#8221; For me, the two biggest adjustments were not seeing my family every day and learning how to budget my time so I could get all of my work done. I am very close with my family back at home, so it was challenging for me to adjust to not seeing or talking with them every day.</p>
<p>However, my initial homesickness was eased when I realized that I have &#8220;family&#8221; here: my team. I met all of the other freshman on the team the first day I got here and we instantly started to bond. We became close friends with each other really quickly and supported each other as we all transitioned to life here in Allentown. The upperclassmen on the team also did an amazing job helping us freshmen feel at home &#8230; The team definitely made my transition to college life a million times easier, because they were kind of like a &#8220;built-in&#8221; support system and group of friends.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t played a lot this year, which is difficult (I mean, doesn&#8217;t everyone want to get into games?); however, just being part of the team is amazing. Being able to play with the girls every day at practice is an honor and even if I don&#8217;t get in all that much in the games, I still really enjoy being able to support and cheer everyone on with the other girls on the team.</p>
<p>I have loved my time spent here at Muhlenberg so far, and I am excited for what the second semester has in store for me personally, and for our team!</p>

<p>My first semester of freshman year was one of the most enjoyable experiences I have ever had. Beginning college was a mixture of many different things; it was exciting, but especially nerve-wracking. I was scared to live away from home, make new friends and play on a brand-new team. </p>
<p>All my fears quickly faded. The girls on my team quickly became some of my best friends, and I adjusted to the college lifestyle quicker than I thought I would with the help of my teammates. Balancing playing on the team and my schoolwork was definitely hard, but it is all about time management and setting your priorities.</p>
<p>It has been an amazing experience playing on a team with these girls, and I’ve learned more about the game of basketball than I have learned my whole life. Even though I do not play as much as some of the other girls on my team, I am honored to be part of the team.  The team is a family and we want all of our team to be successful more than anything else. </p>
<p>The bond we all share with each other is something special, and something I am looking forward to see getting stronger as I spend the next four years of my life as part of the Muhlenberg basketball program.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/12/touheyhs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-637" title="Colleen Touhey" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/12/touheyhs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Colleen Touhey, Women&#8217;s Soccer</strong></p>
<p>First semester was awesome! In the beginning it was very difficult adjusting to playing soccer while also balancing my schoolwork. The academics and athletics are more demanding then they were in high school, but once you get into a routine, it is totally manageable!</p>
<p>Having a team that is basically your family makes it worth every minute. There is always someone on the team willing to help you out with school, sports, or whatever it is that you are struggling with.</p>
<p>I got a lot more playing time than I expected to get this season. It was hard to jump right from high school soccer into college soccer. College games move at a much faster pace and are more physical. The upperclassmen on the team were great at getting me ready to compete in this new playing environment. Each game made me more and more confident. By the end of the season I didn&#8217;t feel like a freshmen stepping out onto the field.</p>
<p>Overall, it has been a great experience!</p>

			<p><em>The third in our series of senior profiles is from men&#8217;s soccer. These profiles were never published in a program, as the Mules&#8217; Senior Day was snowed out, and the site for the rescheduled game was moved to Ursinus.</em></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/11/choihs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-492" title="Conor Choi" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/11/choihs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Conor Choi</strong></p>
<p><strong>How rewarding is it to be playing a much bigger role as a senior? </strong>It’s always a comfort to know that I’m finally having an impact on the success of the team. I’m playing a new position, and it’s been very exciting being able to get more involved in the offense while still being able to help the defense out as well.</p>
<p><strong>How did you choose theatre as your major?</strong><em> </em>I got into theatre in high school. I took a drama history class, and my parents and the teacher encouraged me to audition for “West Side Story,” the winter musical at Hun that year. I got the part of Baby John and had a great experience, so I decided I would go out again the next winter, the only season when I wasn’t playing baseball, soccer or lacrosse. The next year, Hun did “Godspell,” which had a much smaller cast, so being selected to be one of the leads made me start thinking about trying to take theatre a little more seriously. I started taking more acting classes, and decided to stop playing lacrosse for the last two years at Hun so I could do the shows in the spring. Since I hadn’t had much of an issue with juggling both soccer and theatre in high school, choosing theatre as a major wasn’t a very difficult decision at all.</p>
<p><strong>Do you feel that your dance and movement classes have helped you on the field? </strong>I do think that taking dance and movement courses for the past few semesters have had a great impact on my physical health, flexibility and strength. I highly recommend that all of the athletes at least give a dance class a shot because of how closely the two are related.<em></em></p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans?</strong><em> </em>My future plans are to attempt to break into the acting and/or music worlds and industries in whatever way possible.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s it been like being able to play four more years with your high school teammate, Steve Giannacio?</strong><em> </em>Steve has always been one of the best and most intelligent players on the field, so getting to play with him for another four years has really been a great experience. On and off the field, I can always count on Steve to have my back. He’s been an exemplary teammate, and an even better friend, especially as we’ve gotten the opportunity to hang out and play for another four years.<em></em></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/11/giannaciohs.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-489" title="Steve Giannacio" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/11/giannaciohs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Steve Giannacio</strong></p>
<p><strong>How would you describe yourself as a player? </strong>Someone who is constantly thinking a few plays ahead. I try to stress the importance of possession with my teammates.</p>
<p><strong>You are such a loyal New Jersey native that you even took a writing seminar called “Springsteen’s America” at ’Berg. So what’s your favorite Boss tune?</strong><em> “</em>Glory Days,” without question. I even made sure it was on the warmup CD for game days.</p>
<p><strong>How did you decide to double major in accounting and business administration? </strong>After taking financial accounting, I became interested in learning more about the major. Once I began taking more courses within the major, I realized that many overlapped with the requirements for a business major. I chose business management to help expand my knowledge of the business world. <em></em></p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans?</strong><em> </em>I received, and accepted, an offer to work at Deloitte &amp; Touche over the summer. I will be working out of the Princeton office.</p>
<p><strong>What’s it been like being able to play four more years with your high school teammate, Conor Choi? </strong>Conor Choi is one of the most well-liked guys on the team. We have become much closer over the past four years. This year, he earned himself a key role on the team, and I could not be happier for him. It is well deserved.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/11/leischnerhs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-490" title="Tim Leischner" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/11/leischnerhs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Tim Leischner</strong></p>
<p><strong>What was it like getting to play a season in college with your brother? </strong>Well, our parents certainly enjoyed it, and playing a season with my big bro was a lot of fun. He showed me the ropes around Muhlenberg, and it definitely brought us much closer. <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>How was the experience studying abroad in Florence? </strong>It was amazing, literally a once-in-a-lifetime experience. I ate the best food in the world and traveled to parts of Europe that I may never get to see again. It was one of the best times of my life.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What off-the-field accomplishment are you most proud of? </strong>This is a very tough question to answer, but every year the soccer team hosts a soccer clinic for children with autism. Participating in events such as that and seeing the joy on some of the kids’ faces is truly a heart-warming feeling that I am very proud of.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What drew you to accounting and finance as your majors? </strong>I was always intrigued with accounting, mainly because my father is a CPA, and it is basically the foundation of all business. My interests also extend to the stock market and investing, so I double majored in finance. <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans? </strong>After graduation, I will most likely working at a small CPA firm in New York City.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What kind of teammate is Josh Luginbuhl? </strong>Exceptional. On the field, Lugi is an exceptional role model, which is why the players and coaching staff voted him as one of the team captains. Thanks to his outstanding work ethic, he may surprise opponents with his famous lefty shot. Off the field, he is an exceptional friend and someone who I can trust with anything. He is, without a doubt, one of my best friends.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/11/luginbuhlhs.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-491" title="Josh Luginbuhl" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/11/luginbuhlhs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Josh Luginbuhl</strong></p>
<p><strong>What has being a captain meant to you?</strong><em> </em>I’m honored to be one, but it honestly doesn’t feel that much different. I’m not a very vocal leader, so I try to work hard and lead by example.</p>
<p><strong>What’s the most memorable moment from your Mule career?</strong><em> </em>My most memorable moment so far has to be scoring the game-winning goal against Stevens Tech in double overtime in the NCAA Tournament and then hosting the “Sweet 16” last year. It was a truly awesome experience.</p>
<p><strong>What made you choose biology as your major?</strong><em> </em>I’ve always been a science guy and wanted to pursue a career in the medical field. So studying biology just always seemed like the perfect fit.<em></em></p>
<p><strong>What was it like interning at St. Luke’s Hospital? </strong>It was really exciting. I was able to see things that I wouldn’t have been able to otherwise. You can only learn so much from books; being in the operating room is 100 times better.<em></em></p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans?</strong><em> </em>My future plans are to continue my education to pursue a career in medicine.</p>
<p><strong>What’s Tim Leischner like off the field? </strong>If you think Tim Leischner is an animal on the field, you should see him off of it. His flow is second to none, and he takes great pride in that. I can only hope that one day my hair will be as cool as Tim’s. But seriously, Tim is an all-around great guy and one of my closest friends. </p>

			<p><em>A couple of weeks ago, we ran excerpts from the senior profiles that ran in the Senior Night programs for the volleyball team. Today, we take a closer look at the five seniors on the women&#8217;s soccer team.</em></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/11/millerhs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-450" title="Nicolette Miller" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/11/millerhs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Nicolette Miller</strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s the most memorable moment from your Mule career? </strong>Winning seven straight games, hosting the Centennial Conference tournament and qualifying for the NCAA Tournament my sophomore year.</p>
<p><strong>What’s it mean to you that you rank in the top 10 in school history in every offensive category and have started all but one game in your career?</strong><em> </em>It’s pretty cool to be in the top 10 in those categories. It’s neat to have something like that to reflect on all the hard work I’ve put in the last four years. As for starting all but one game, I played my junior season with a broken finger and half my senior season with a really bad ankle. You gotta do what you gotta do. <em></em></p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans?</strong> Hopefully working in sports media, or possibly going to grad school.<em></em></p>
<p><strong>What’s it been like playing with Meghan O’Grady?</strong><em> </em>I met Meg the night before our first preseason practice as freshmen … We joke now that our first impressions of each other both led us to believe that we were both “too cool” to ever become friends. But almost four years later, she’s not only my roommate, but my best friend, sister and even “mom” in many cases (she hates when I say that) &#8230; I’ve been lucky to make such an incredible friend and even luckier that I got to play soccer with her. It’s been an amazing four years.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/11/ogradyhs.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-451" title="Meghan O'Grady" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/11/ogradyhs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Meghan O’Grady</strong></p>
<p><strong>What was it like playing soccer in Ireland?</strong><em> </em>Playing soccer with Nicolette at the University of Limerick was much different than playing at ’Berg. The team was very successful, and there were some very good players, but it was much more laid back (just like the Irish culture) compared to what we are used to. Despite the casual atmosphere of the overall soccer program, we ended up going to the National Intervarsity Tournament where we faced the other top universities in Ireland. Our team won the championship for the fourth straight year, so Nic and I can proudly say we won a national championship in our four years of college 🙂</p>
<p><strong>What was it like getting to play in college with two of your sisters?</strong><em> </em>Meeting my sisters back on the field after two years of not playing with them was an exciting experience. Since the time we first started playing soccer until they graduated high school, we had always been on the same team, so playing with them in college felt very natural. I enjoyed having two years of high school and college as the only O’Grady, however I am happy that I had the opportunity to experience the college game with them. <em></em></p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans?</strong><em> </em>I would like to attend law school within a year or two of graduation. I am looking into applying this year, but am also looking at opportunities to take a year off before going.</p>
<p><strong>What kind of teammate is Nicolette Miller?</strong><em> </em>Nicolette has been a teammate who has always pushed me to do better. Her work ethic on the field makes me, and the rest of the team, want to work just as hard. Playing the same position, Nicolette and I have been able to learn from one another. Each of us is unique in the way we play and are able to complement each other with our individual strengths, while also giving advice to make each other better.<em></em></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/11/toherhs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-452" title="Michele Toher" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/11/toherhs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Michele Toher</strong></p>
<p><strong>When did you start wearing your distinctive orange jersey? </strong>I started to wear orange in middle school, and it just became my color. The jersey I wear now has been with me since my sophomore year of high school, and I have worn it in almost every game since.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s the best thing about being a goalie? </strong>I love the thrill and aggressive aspect of playing goalie. Nothing feels better than making a big save to keep my team in the game.</p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans? </strong>I plan on going to law school.</p>
<p><strong>What kind of person is Jamie Weiss? </strong>Jamie Weiss is someone who I admire for her strength and will power. After tearing her ACL, she has done nothing but work hard to get back on the field. She has been a major contributor to the team every time she steps on the field, and it has truly been a pleasure to play with someone like Jamie.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/11/weisshs.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-453" title="Jamie Weiss" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/11/weisshs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Jamie Weiss</strong></p>
<p><strong>How good did it feel getting back on the field after being injured last year? </strong>Stepping onto the field against McDaniel with the bench and fans cheering loudly is a moment I will never forget. I was anxious, overwhelmed and really excited actually being back in a real game. Soon after I got in, I passed my first ball (we’ll say it was a great one!), and all the nerves left. I loved being out there again!<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What off-the-field accomplishment are you most proud of? </strong>My perfection of the two-handed hug with coach! We have practiced on several occasions, and it is getting pretty natural, which is a huge accomplishment!</p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans? </strong>Stay at Muhlenberg forever! But if they force me to graduate, I am looking to apply to physician’s assistant graduate programs and pursue a career as an orthopedic assistant.</p>
<p><strong>What has Rachel Zarkin brought to the team this year? </strong>The better question is what has Rachel not brought to the team? … Within about 30 seconds of Rachel meeting the team at JFK Airport (very, very early in the morning), everyone forgot she was new. Not only has Rachel been an awesome addition to the team as a player, but she has also been a personal gain for everyone, because I can confidently say that everyone has made a new friend. The season definitely would not have been the same without her.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/11/zarkinhs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-454" title="Rachel Zarkin" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/11/zarkinhs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Rachel Zarkin</strong></p>
<p><strong>What made you decide to come out for the team this fall? </strong>I missed being part of a team and the competitive atmosphere. I was originally going to play my freshman year but decided to take a break from soccer to experience things I never had the time for in high school. I didn’t want to graduate regretting anything, and a large part of me wished I was still playing soccer, so I joined the soccer team!</p>
<p><strong>What off-the-field accomplishment are you most proud of? </strong>My junior year I was a civic fellow through the Office of Community Engagement, and part of my fellowship was to volunteer at an organization and help improve it in some way. I decided to work at the Allentown Health Bureau to help expand a program called Shape It Up, a local elementary after-school program. The program is targeted at kids who are overweight and tries to help get them motivated to work out and have fun while doing so. The program is still running and open for any Muhlenberg student who would like to volunteer.</p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans? </strong>I’m not really sure yet. I eventually hope to get a job, but before that I want to do something different (travel, work abroad, volunteer, etc.). So we shall see &#8230;</p>
<p><strong>What’s Michele Toher like as a teammate? </strong>She’s an awesome teammate. She is definitely someone who leads by example and works hard every time she steps onto the field. And she’s so freaking good; it’s a little ridiculous!</p>

<p><strong>Football at Ursinus (Saturday, 1:00)</strong></p>
<p>Two of the three teams that tied for the Centennial Conference championship last year face each other in what should be a close game &#8211; the teams have the same CC record (5-2), with their losses coming to the same teams (Johns Hopkins and Gettysburg). Muhlenberg has won 10 of the last 11 meetings. The Mules rank in the top 20 in Division III in three defensive categories (sacks, turnover margin and scoring defense) and have allowed a total of only 31 points in their last four games. The Bears are in the top 20 in punt returns and kickoff returns.</p>
