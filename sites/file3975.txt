<p>Cecillia Kang. (8, April 2011). Web firms face increased federal scrutiny over Internet privacy. <em>The Washington Post. </em>Retrieved from <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/web-firms-face-increased-federal-scrutiny-over-internet-privacy/2011/04/06/AFvREp1C_story.html">http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/web-firms-face-increased-federal-scrutiny-over-internet-privacy/2011/04/06/AFvREp1C_story.html</a></p>

<p>Internet radio, such as Pandora, used with linking pin power roles such as the smartphone mobile industry, was recently subpoenaed by the government on the terms of illegal distribution of personal information.  When a user logs into an internet related radio site on their smartphone, their private information is given to that certain company to be distributed to their client power role, the advertisers.  Using Pandora, (although other internet related radio websites have been included in this court hearing) a federal grand jury served this subpoena in order to justify that these services disclose users personal information such as telephone number, gender, personal interests, and other information, illegally.</p>
<p><span id="more-1100"></span></p>
<p>Not only are the internet radio sites being reevaluated for their privacy terms, but most of the internet is also, involving the internet power role.  In a Washington post article, the associated press tells that the Federal Trades Commission is now wanting to post a &#8220;Do Not Track&#8221; option for internet users.  The federal grand jury investigation is prominent on declining Pandora&#8217;s ability to access users information from their smartphone accounts.  Having advertisers as client power roles, Pandora released the private information to third parties for these advertisers to see the demographics and the amount of users on their site.  &#8220;Pandora said it shared information with third parties to help it track how users interact with the service and to deliver targeted advertising. But the company, based in Oakland, Calif., said it was “not a specific target” of the grand jury investigation.&#8221; (NYtimes.com)</p>
<p>Because internet radio is an enormous distributor and exhibitor power role, it will be extremely hard to shut it down; along with all the other cloud-based radio stations.  But having the &#8220;Do Not Track&#8221; option on their website will definitely create a boundary when it comes to gathering information for targeting their audiences for their paying advertisers.  &#8220;In its filing, Pandora said that a government Do Not Track mandate &#8216;could significantly hinder our ability to collect and use data relating to listeners&#8217; &#8220;(NYtimes.com).</p>
