								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span lang="EN-US">“Since its </span><span lang="EN-US">commercial birth in </span><span lang="EN-US">the 1950s </span><span lang="EN-US">as a </span><span lang="EN-US">technological oddity at a science fair, gaming has blossomed into one of most profitable entertainment </span><span lang="EN-US">industries in the</span><span lang="EN-US"> world.</span><span lang="EN-US">” (Chiknani</span><span lang="EN-US">, 2015)But how </span><span lang="EN-US">does the gaming industries exuberant in such a short time? As we all know, in 1967, the first game system designed </span><span lang="EN-US">and named “Brown Box”. But the “Brown Box” didn’t sold well because the mismanaged and the fact that home gaming was a relatively alien concept to average American at that time. And how technology’</span><span lang="EN-US">s advancement and the increase </span><span lang="EN-US">of the gaming community changed this situation through the history?</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">In 1970s, the first example of players competing on separate screens came and made the gaming community bigger. Later, technological advancements such as Intel’s invention of the world’s first microprocessor made the home gaming became a reality. Recently, the invention of the personal computers and the appearance of Smartphone made the gaming became more convenience, diverse, and interesting. These changes not only make the gaming industries flower, but also change people life.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">It is hard for the people in 1970s to believe that nowadays more than 42 percent of Americans are gamers and four out of five U.S. households have a console. To see these changes in a positive way, the advance of the gaming really rich people’</span><span lang="EN-US">s life, satisfy the demand that people can never get from the reality, and relax people from the serious social pressure. But on the other hand,</span> <span lang="EN-US">the increase of the gaming community made the age of the gamers become smaller and smaller. And this is a very worrying thing because teens don’t have the ability to judge the right and wrong. I used to see the news that a fifteen years old teen killed his friend in a quarrel, when asked about the reason, he said: “I killed people who made me unhappy in the game, and don’t worry, he will soon resurrect.” </span><span lang="EN-US">What a lamentable thing! And the </span><span lang="EN-US">gaming also reduces the time that people spend on outdoor activities which is a bad thing for our health</span><span lang="EN-US">.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">About the </span><span lang="EN-US">future, because the technologies </span><span lang="EN-US">like virtual reality and artificial intelligence technology will make the gaming </span><span lang="EN-US">experience become more stimulating, interesting, authentic, how to protect ourselves from the gaming become a problem.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every person has an image of what a gamer looks like, and unfortunately, many opinions are based off of misconceptions. It may be difficult to understand a gamer from a non-gamer’s perspective, and Maeve Duggan of the Pew Research Center proves that many people are misinformed about gaming. In most of the infographics, those who answered “unsure” made up an unsettling portion of the population (around 20%); it made me question the validity of the results. Even those who identify as gamers may have stereotypes about gaming. According to the survey, “men and women are equally likely to assume that most video game players are men regardless of whether they themselves play games” (Duggan, 2015, p. 3). I have though about this stigma as it applies to my own life, because I used to (and sometimes still do) play games a lot. I have had a lot of boys respond “Oh, that’s cool” when I tell them I play games, but I feel like there is a different reaction if a male identifies as a gamer. He is generally perceived as lazy, as if all he does is play games. Yet, when a female plays games, she is seen as more masculine and that is “cool”? Although these are generalizations, I find these things true in my own life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, I can only imagine that a the idea of a female gamer has become more common over the past decade. As it becomes more and more acceptable for a female to act masculine and vice versa, the stigma of gaming is changing. Just eight years ago, the ratio of males to females in terms of gamers was 13:7, when now it is practically equal (Lenhart, 2008, p.1). I think that this stereotype will begin to fade as time goes on. It will become “normal” for a girl to identify as gamer. Eliminating sexist stigmas like this will eventually lead to more equality for all people. The longer people hold on to ideas, the longer it will take us to progress as a society. So, next time a female tells you she plays games, do not think of it as abnormal, consider her like any other gamer.</p>
