								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite going on multiple different search engines including bing and google, as well as using a computer other than my own, I was not able to find much information on myself. After scrolling through the first few pages of google, I finally found an article  that was written by my town’s newspaper regarding a community service project  I was a part of in middle school. I was quite surprised by this as I assumed my social media would pop up. Although I am careful with my privacy settings, I assumed my name on the profiles would match when with my google search ;however, that was not the case. Abby’s profile on linkedIn kept popping up but my name, abbey, did not pop up. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Confused by the lack of information that popped up, I tried typing in my full name, Abigail, instead of Abbey. Although results were still not on the first page, I did find my full name on my school’s website where they posted the honor role.  Although I may not have seen much information on myself, I still don&#8217;t know what is out there. I still don&#8217;t know what other people see as their google searches will all bring up different things. The internet is unpredictable and you have to be extra careful.  </span></p>
