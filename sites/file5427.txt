								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This past Tuesday was our first time performing in front of an audience.  The audience consisted of current Muhlenberg students who will be facilitating the discussions that will be held after each show for the Freshmen this weekend.  Yesterday, Wednesday, however, was our first performance in front of freshmen.  It was a very specific freshmen group &#8211; the athletes &#8211; and overall I think it went very well!</p>
<p>Personally, I found there to be a noticeable difference between the two performances.  The first one found the audience responding with laughter to some of the lines in our script, much more so than the second performance.  This isn&#8217;t necessarily a good or bad thing but there was definitely a difference and I think this difference is important in the ensemble&#8217;s understanding of who exactly our audience this weekend will be.</p>
<p>The facilitators in the first performance were all upperclassmen and also students who have either been in the Diversity Project in previous years or are already involved in these sorts of conversations on diversity in some way.  Basically they are &#8220;on the inside&#8221;, they already know and understand, to some extent, the issues of diversity that are happening on our campus currently.   The freshmen athletes were &#8220;on the outside&#8221;, meaning that this was, for the most part, the first time they were introduced to this subject matter and the accompanying issues.  This explains why some of the &#8220;hilarity&#8221; wasn&#8217;t as easily visible for them because they don&#8217;t quite understand as they had yet a chance to participate in such discussions .  Although some of us in the Diversity Project first thought this lack of responsiveness to be synonymous to iciness and not being receptive, we later discovered from the facilitators that they all actually had a lot to say in their discussions.  It goes to show the fact that when you&#8217;re introduced to these issues surrounding diversity, it takes some time to process &#8211; and that&#8217;s okay!  As an ensemble I think we learned to not take the audience&#8217;s reaction so personally.</p>
<p>I think this past performance really set us up for how this weekend will be and allowed us to learn and understand that this performance isn&#8217;t about freshmen &#8220;getting it&#8221;.  It&#8217;s meant to work as a starting point for people to be introduced to and invited into the conversation.  And I think we&#8217;ve accomplished just that.</p>
