    <meta property="og:description" content="We&rsquo;ve hinted at it in the last two IT/DL Video Updates. Well here it is, folks! If you&rsquo;re ready to learn, we&rsquo;re ready to roll with &hellip; Golf Cart Pedagogy.Golf cart what? Pedagogy who?Allow us to explain. Golf Cart Pedagogy is yet another vehicle (see what we did there - vehicle?!) for faculty, staff and students to discuss the ways they&rsquo;re using technology to support teaching and learning here at Muhlenberg. This video series will explore the creative ways our community members are using edtech of all shapes and sizes.We hope these conversations (on four wheels) will inspire you to explore new tools, or use current tool in new ways. Plus we think it&rsquo;s a pretty neat way to introduce the community to members that they may only see in passing on Academic Row.Join host Anthony Dalton in this episode for a&amp;nbsp;discussion featuring special guest Dr. Tineke D&#039;Haeseleer, Assistant Professor of History.See Tineke&#039;s work at&amp;nbsp;tdh.bergbuilds.domains, and be sure to follow her on Twitter @tinebeestWe in IT/MS hope that you will find this series as exciting as we do! With that, we invite your feedback.If you would like to nominate yourself or a colleague for a future episode of Golf Cart Pedagogy, or you have a topic you&rsquo;d like us to explore, please email us at&amp;nbsp;itms@muhlenberg.edu." />

Golf Cart Pedagogy is yet another vehicle (see what we did there - vehicle?!) for faculty, staff and students to discuss the ways they’re using technology to support teaching and learning here at Muhlenberg. This video series will explore the creative ways our community members are using edtech of all shapes and sizes.</p><p>We hope these conversations (on four wheels) will inspire you to explore new tools, or use current tool in new ways. Plus we think it’s a pretty neat way to introduce the community to members that they may only see in passing on Academic Row.</p></span>Join host Anthony Dalton in this episode for a&nbsp;discussion featuring special guest Dr. Tineke D'Haeseleer, Assistant Professor of History.<br><br>See Tineke's work at&nbsp;tdh.bergbuilds.domains, and be sure to follow her on Twitter @tinebeest<br><p>We in IT/MS hope that you will find this series as exciting as we do! With that, we invite your feedback.</p>If you would like to nominate yourself or a colleague for a future episode of Golf Cart Pedagogy, or you have a topic you’d like us to explore, please email us at&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">itms@muhlenberg.edu.</a><br></div></div></div></div></div></div>    </div>
