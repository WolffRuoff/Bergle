					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Jamie, this was a truly great read. As Abbey said, I believe that this year&#039;s presidential election, social media has been even more relevant than ever before. I think that it becomes even more prevalent because of the fact that people who like to share their opinions online and on social media, may very well end up on your news feed, therefore the information is shared a lot easier.  This is such an interesting topic. I cannot wait to hear and read more about it from you!&lt;/p&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Social Media has definitely had a huge impact on this election in particular. As important as the debates and in person speeches are for the candidates, it seems as though their social media presence is gaining more attention. Many people dont have 2 hours to sit and watch a debate so they look to twitter or facebook for the highlights. Social media has become a news source for many people and therefore the candidates need to worry about their online presence just as much as their t.v or live appearances.&lt;/p&gt;
