								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What is the first thing that comes to mind when you think of Instagram? My mind is immediately flooded with selfies, pictures of dogs, and even last nights dinner. The social platform allows people to freely post pictures and anyone that follows them can see it. Harmless right? The world of Instagram <i>was</i>, up until a much younger generation got ahold of it.</p>
<p>The article I found, <i>Lesson Learned: Kids and Instagram</i> is written by Wendi Aarons, a mother who describes her experience of allowing her eleven year old son to get an Instagram. When her son first downloaded the app, it looked the same as any other kids’. He began following his classmates from school, star athletes he looked up to, and post pictures of the family cat. It was the epitome of what an eleven year old’s Instagram should look like. However this photo sharing app is not made for children. They do not fully understand its purpose, and this mom quickly realized it. When Wendi proceeded to check up on his account, she found many things that were pretty alarming. First she came across the name of the school her son attended written in his bio, which she thought was alarming until she read the bio’s on the Instagram accounts of his friends. So many depicted their new relationship status. Wendi expressed,“Kids who I remember peeing their pants in Kindergarten now describe themselves online as “Taken!!” or ‘Single and Wants to Mingle!’…It was shocking because I had absolutely no idea that 10 and 11 year-old kids were already ‘dating’” (Aarons). Girls were beginning to make comments on boy’s photos complimenting them on how ‘hot they are’ and how much they ‘like them.’ Wendi finally stumbled upon something that left her in disbelief. An account was made about a girl that her son went to school with. The whole profile was making fun of how ugly this ten year old was.</p>
<p>Instagram, a photo sharing app, is used by children in a whole different way than its meant for. Instead of just editing and posting pictures and videos, children put themselves in dangerous positions by revealing personal information about themselves. They also come in contact with people they don’t even know, who could potentially harm them. Technology and social media like Instagram are putting the young generation into a whole new perspective. How long can we keep them safe?</p>
