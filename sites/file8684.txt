								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you have a twitter account or are involved in any type of social media, you have probably seen a “hashtag” before. We know hashtags most popularly as simple ways for people to search for tweets that have a common theme or topic. “Hashtags can be used to collect public opinion on events and ideas at the local, corporate, or world level” (&#8220;Hashtag&#8221;, 2015). For example, if you wanted to see people’s opinions of Donald Trump, you could simply search #DonaldTrump in the twitter search bar and get an entire feed of tweets pertaining to him. Hashtags are used for a variety of reasons and if promoted by enough people, can even “trend” and therefore attract more people to the topic at hand.</p>
<p>While many people may believe the “hashtag” originated on Twitter, it is actually not a Twitter function. Also known as the “number sign,” hashtags were first used in information technology to highlight a specific meaning. For example, “In 1978, Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie used # in the C programming language for special keywords that had to be processed first by the C preprocessor” (&#8220;Hashtag&#8221;, 2015). Later on, IRC networks began to use number signs to label channels or topics. A man named Chris Messina was inspired by the IRC and proposed a similar system to be used on Twitter, tweeting, “how do you feel about using # (pound) for groups. As in #barcamp?” (&#8220;Hashtag&#8221;, 2015) on August 23, 2007. This proposal became extremely popular and continued to grow as Twitter began to hyperlink all hashtags and eventually introduce “Trending Topics” on its front page. Hashtags are now used on a variety of different platforms, including Instagram, YouTube, Google, and even on television.</p>
<p>Businesses and advocacy organizations have especially taken advantage of the “hashtag” by connecting the popularity of social media with the promotion of their products, services, or campaigns. For example, “There is a collaboration between the social networking site Twitter and American Express that makes it possible to buy discounted goods online by tweeting a special hashtag. American Express members can sync their card with Twitter and use the offers by tweeting and look for a response in a tweet with the confirmation from American Express” (&#8220;Hashtag&#8221;, 2015). Not only can hashtags positively affect a business’ market, but they can also be used with a negative connotation, where they are better known as “bashtags.” Nowadays, it is extremely common for people to use social media platforms in order to complain about poor customer service or to criticize a company. Hashtags have the power of drawing attention to important issues and controversial topics.</p>
<p>Overall, people have found a countless amount of ways to use hashtags for their own benefit; whether to spark a conversation, start a trend, gain more followers, or to promote a specific event or campaign. For better or for worse, hashtags have become extremely powerful tools not only in social media, but in our everyday lives.</p>
