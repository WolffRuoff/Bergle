<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Place: Trinity College</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Observed on Wednesday, March 7th at 5:15PM by Stephanie Tabas, Sasha Cheer, and Jacob Borislow.</span></p>
<p><b><em>Trinity College Entryway into College Main Square:</em> </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The narrow entryway of Trinity College condenses and directs the stream of people entering and departing the campus directly down its center. Directly inside the entryway is a covered stone and wood structure. People linger here to take photos of the main square from inside the arched doorway. There are ads and flyers all along the walls, but no one appears remotely interested in stopping to read them. For people exiting campus, this archway is treated as a transitional space that needs no pause; their goal is to leave and they are focused in the direction they are headed. However, those entering campus pause for few moments to take a picture of the tower that can be seen through the archway, before proceeding closer to the tower itself. In short, though these two groups of people are in the same physical locale at the same time, the context causes them to experience the same spot as a different “place.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As per the typical weather in Ireland, the air is sharp and cold. People in the space do not indicate an obvious discomfort due to the weather. Many people are situated in groups, and those who are individual appear to walk with a clear destination in mind. Multiple languages can can be heard, and many people have their phones out taking photos. Most notable is the rows of bikes lining the black chain fences that surround the green lawns on the edges of the main square. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Without intention, nearly all photos and videos that we took had a bike (or many bikes) in the frame, exhibiting bikes as a defining characteristic of the Trinity College campus. If mobile media is defined as something you take with you that contributes to your identity, a bike could be considered a form of mobile media. In the case of Trinity College, it is the form of mobile media that defines Trinity College as a “place.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You would never see all those bikes ridden at the same time&#8211;people are always coming and going. As soon as someone comes and unlocks their bike, someone else will come and put their bike in its place. It illustrates that this particularly busy place is constantly moving. Some of the bikes were brightly colored, or customized in some way, illustrating the identity and personality of each bike owner. However, it is not just what </span><span style="font-weight: 400">the bike looks like, but where the bike </span><i style="font-family: inherit;font-weight: inherit"><span style="font-weight: 400">is</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> that tells you about the person. Where they choose to lock up their bike (the most convenient place, the safest place, the most popular place, etc.) reveals even more about the owner’s identity.</span></p>
<p><em><b>Library Lawn/Book of Kells Courtyard:</b></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There are less groups here and more walking individuals&#8211;mostly students, as indicated by their backpacks and the general attitude they have toward the space. For example, people can be seen sitting on the steps with their books, walking into the library, lounging on the benches, kissing on the benches, etc. In other words, it is a place of general non-movement. It is more of a slow moving, sitting space, as demonstrated by the lawn’s absence of bikes, in contrast to the fast pace of the college’s main square, where bikes are present and people are focused on walking as opposed to resting. Although walking within the library lawn could be argued as a movement, walking here is just traveling to a place of non-movement as one sits down to read or study.  </span></p>
<p><em><b>Berkeley Library Pedestal:</b></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The centerpiece of the pedestal outside of Berkeley Library is a large brass globe that spins when pushed. The only bikes in sight are along the back wall of the stone pedestal in the far left corner, farthest from the library entrance and leaning on a wall, a place not seemingly meant for bikes. The small cluster of bikes are indicative of the way people navigate through the space and are permitted to do so. By leaving your bike somewhere that is not the designated place to leave a bike, you are changing the landscape to fit your needs. This is illustrative of mobile media as one’s needs are a part of their person and it is also used to adapt the physical space to one’s own comfort. People are encouraged to place their bikes closest to the exit off the pedestal and closest to the road even though this position is farther from the library exit.</span></p>
<p><em><b>Road &amp; General Area off of Berkeley Library Pedestal:</b></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A cobblestone pathway and lawn on the right is framed by the same black chain fences found in the college’s main square. This “place” exists as a prelude to the college’s bustling main square while simultaneously not fully leaving the non-movement of the library. Bikes line these chain fences shoulder to shoulder and although not</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400"> quite</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> as densely packed as those in the college’s main square, they are at the fringe&#8211;waiting to be put into the movement of the main square, but concurrently existing within the slower non-movement of the library pedestal.</span></p>

<p><em><strong>Section Two: Interviews</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Sasha&#8217;s Interview</strong></em></p>
<p>Domestication, as defined by Bertel “emphasizes the active role of individuals and groups in shaping technologies as they are integrated into the contexts and practices of everyday life” (Bertel, 2017), or more simply, refers to how people, either as individuals or groups change or accommodate their behavior to adapt to the technologies that have become a common occurrence. In regards to the smartphone specifically, domestication theory looks at how we have adjusted our habits, wants and priorities—and even the very focus of our lives to integrate or “domesticate” the smartphone.</p>
<p>When asking Jacob when he uses his phone he thought for a moment, then said succinctly “When I wake up, when I eat, when I go to bed” implying that he had cleanly set times in which he tended to use his phone adding that “I don’t typically multi-task.” This seemed to indicate that at some level Jacob had an awareness of the domestication he applied to his smartphone, adding, “I’m not that glued to my smartphone, honestly.”</p>
<p>This led to the question of what he mainly used his phone for. This answer was also rather concise: “Facebook and any messages, on any platform.” Jacob also added with a laugh that sometimes he will watch “one YouTube video if I need motivation to get out of bed.” When asked about how often he feels compelled to check Facebook or such said messages, he replied “I don’t typically walk down the street looking at Facebook. Unless I get a message and I’m like ooh—who’s messaging me?” This illustrates a habit that arises from the domestication of the smartphone—in that the curiosity that arises from the normal presence of the smartphone dictates that since you can receive a message anytime, anywhere, if Jacob is messaged, it is natural to know who at hat exact moment in time is thinking of him and for what reason.</p>
<p>Jacob wears a watch, so there is also no reason for him to use his phone. Although the phone is perfectly capable of telling time and would be “less bulk” to carry around, the watch clearly brings him enjoyment, so there is no reason to abandon it. The smartphone then, has not caused Jacob to change things within his life that he enjoys—rather, it has been domesticated into Jacob’s life as an object of convenience for things that he does not mind changing.</p>
<p>The functions that Jacob uses most often are YouTube with Facebook (“Stuff I care about is news. Its my news source”) being a close second. Jacob could easily name the most well-known YouTubers, and enthusiastically listed off the favorites that he likes to follow. He stated that he really enjoys pop-culture and pop-culture theory, implying that it was enjoyable to see others undergoing as well as contributing to that same enjoyment. When asked why YouTube and mobile access to YouTube was so important to him he replied, “It’s entertaining. Why is YouTube…? I’ve never really thought about it.” He took a pause. “It improves my experience—like if I’m eating food….Why would you watch other people playing games? You do it for the people.” It is particularly interesting that Jacob phrased it in this, particularly because he has had earlier clarified that when he is eating at a restaurant alone he typically watches YouTube videos, as he finds that it improves his eating enjoyment.</p>
<p>He lamented the “lazy” stigma often put upon YouTubers, emphasizing through logical argument how much time, energy, and technical work it takes to produce videos multiple times a week. Clearly, he understands the YouTuber schedule, and has a clear grasp on the economic pressures of YouTube platform. While he could easily obtain such content on a laptop (and he does) having YouTube in the mobile capacity enables him to integrate himself into the YouTube world through the domestication use of his phone. In mobile form, he almost literally has the capacity to “consume” it, as paralleled by his utilizing the platform as he eats solitary. This factor is not insignificant, as he both mentioned it himself and as it eating is typically a “stationary” moment. I began to pick up a pattern that it is when Jacob is most stationary that he is also the most mobile.</p>
<p>Communication and the content then, seem to be his primary mobile uses. “I’m definitely someone who takes in more content then he creates. It is quite rare when I post anything on Facebook. Or like anything actually.” Rather, Jacob’s phone is an illustration of his phone use as it pertains to his tastes, as well as to how his mind works in organizing his communication. He organized his phone thusly: his Siri is male and British, factors set by Jacob who has it call him “Master Jacob, so it could be my Alfred” to satisfy his own personal joke as well as remind him of the things he likes. “All my social media apps are in a group, even if I don’t use them all”, he continues implying that he prefers an orderly mobile space, even if it isn’t “clean”—for example, the fact that he does not use them all, and as he shifted through his phone he exclaimed “Oh, I forgot I had Akinator.” He stated, “I don’t really buy apps, so I put it towards personalized ringtones. When I put someone’s number, I put a picture of them that I affiliate with. Like some guy who likes James Bond I put the James Bond theme song.” Once again, an illustration of how he uses the phone to apply his passions to everyday life.</p>
<p>The physical organization of Jacob’s phone is a hard cover case with a stand. Once again, this is indicative of what he uses his phone for most: ease of watching YouTube videos. “I prefer a medium bulkiness. Homepage wallpaper—I have to change it honestly, it’s a little old—it Carnage from Spiderman. My homepage: It’s Bullet Club—It’s a Japanese wrestling club. Also, a bunch of them are nerds—one of them is a YouTuber with a lot of subscribers who I follow.” Both the physical and software attributes of his phone are applied, or domesticated, by Jacob himself. The phone is not only in his life, but is fully integrated within it—it is used to access his passions, and said use is displayed physically as a result of how he uses it. Even the status in which he keeps his phone—silent, tells us something of here Jacob’s mind is: “I always have my phone on silent. It’s easier. Like when a movie is starting I don’t have to remember to turn it off.” Media and entertainment then (movies) and the proper etiquette involving them appear to have an influence on how he uses the settings.</p>
<p>He didn’t seem too particularly fussy over any certain type of function of a phone. Jacob’s main requirements for a phone are that it works and has enough memory. When asked if there were any features he did not like he replied “My newer phone I did the fingerprint scan. I kind of regretted it after I gave Apple my fingerprint scan. I mean of course they say they don’t keep it on record but…” he trailed off and we shared that suspicious look one sometimes gives the computer when accessing pirated content, or when glancing at the shady camera on the back wall of a supermarket. Once domesticated, a phone can feel so incredibly personal it is easy to forget that such personalization, such telling aspects of your identity are not only being accessed by you, but received by those around you—and perhaps most invisibly, by those who give you the means to personalize.</p>

<p><em><strong>Jacob&#8217;s Interview </strong></em></p>
<p>The mobile phone has a large influence on S’s life and there are a variety of<br />
ways that her cell phone has been domesticated into being an integral aspect for her.<br />
According to Haddon (2017), an analysis of domestication &#8220;&#8230;helps to make sense of<br />
people&#8217;s engagement with technologies through understanding the broader context of<br />
their lives [including] their uses of the technologies, the location and timing of that use<br />
and how and why they talk about or otherwise display their devices and services. That<br />
entails understanding people&#8217;s circumstances, their biographies, the meanings that ICTs<br />
have for them and, as part of this, their relations and negotiations with others&#8221; (Haddon<br />
2017, Pg. 71). As Haddon notes, the domesticated usage of technologies does not<br />
simply entail the traditional and “normal” uses but any uses that have the technology be<br />
adapted into a person’s life in any shape and form. As will be revealed, S uses her<br />
phone in a variety of traditional and nontraditional ways all of which demonstrate her<br />
domestication of her phone into her life to a very great extent. A nontraditional use of<br />
her phone can be seen in the first way that it is incorporated into S’s life.<br />
The first and most basic way that the mobile phone factors into S’s life is she<br />
self-describes it as always being in her hand whenever possible. Even if the phone is<br />
not being used and is off, S still feels the need to keep it in her hand. Admittedly,<br />
the reason for it always being in her hand is because she feels that she must always<br />
have something to do with her hands no matter what it is. The fact that her object of<br />
choice to put in her hands is her mobile phone proves how it has been domesticated<br />
into serving an important purpose not originally intended but still deemed integral. The<br />
phone is used in a way mobile phones aren’t typically used with an emphasis on its use<br />
as a physical object rather than what it digitally is capable of.<br />
Moving on to the actual technological and digital usage of her mobile phone,<br />
S frequents all the expected apps including Facebook and Instagram. She mostly<br />
observes and gets her knowledge of what’s going on with her friends from the apps.<br />
This has made it so S doesn’t have to ask her friends what they’ve been up to and<br />
can instead with the press of a button and slide of a thumb know instantly. When she<br />
does post, her content mostly consists of selfies and pictures of her friends as she<br />
admits that she feels it proves to the world (or at least all her followers) that she hangs<br />
out with people. Her mobile phone has been domesticated into being her path to<br />
self-verification as it admittedly has been for many people that have been researched.<br />
As Elliott &amp; Urry have written about in their article “New Technologies, New Mobilities”,<br />
emotions and therefore general identity have been restructured thanks to more of a<br />
person’s life being a digital life (Elliott &amp; Urry, Pg. 35). S is clearly not the minority<br />
in the usage of her phone to get satisfaction and connections in this new world where<br />
digital interactions have real consequences that shape who a person is and how they<br />
feel. If someone is not careful, their life can be too shaped around their phone and<br />
before long their phone and digital presence is all they are in life.<br />
The first thing S does when she wakes up is to immediately check the apps<br />
with the most notifications demonstrating how an aspect of her life is adapted around<br />
the presence of the phone and her digital presence on the technology. As with many<br />
people, S adapted her phone menu to fit her needs and features the apps she uses<br />
the most on the main screen along with a group of apps paired together that are the<br />
apps she uses less but still has usage for such as the MyTaxi and photo editing apps.<br />
The arrangement of apps is for the same reason that her phone is always put in the<br />
same spot at night, for the ease of it demonstrating that she has molded her phone in a<br />
similar way to how she has admittedly molded her life, to make it as easy and the least<br />
stressful as possible. S&#8217;s portable charger has been domesticated into being an<br />
integral part of what she chooses to carry with her as she goes about her day.<br />
The reason S chooses to carry around her portable charger is especially<br />
interesting and important is, for a girl like S who has little to no pockets, she must<br />
be very picky about what she chooses to have as it easily stacks up. The portable<br />
charger is so integral to S’s life that it has a priority over many other items as not<br />
having it causes her to be very stressed. The stress comes from the feeling that if her<br />
phone is at less than 70%, it’s dead to her as well as the belief that the phone can’t die<br />
or else “it feels like it would have abandoned me”. While she admits nothing traumatic<br />
would happen it still causes her a great deal of stress and the fact that a simple plastic<br />
object that powers another manufactured object can be the cause of such stress for her<br />
demonstrates the power of the domestication of technology.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong>Steph&#8217;s Interview</strong></em></p>
<p>The person I interviewed (here on out referred to as “Alex”) was a particularly interesting case, as they do not regularly use a smartphone. Because of this, I decided to come up with some alternative questions, in the event that some of the provided questions would be rendered irrelevant to their specific experience. Unlike most millennial&#8217;s, Alex does not use a smartphone in their daily life. Instead, they use a Tracfone. The Tracfone has no apps, and no touch screen; it is essentially the most basic flip phone, that can be used just to text and call.</p>
<p>So why doesn’t Alex use a smartphone, when so many of their peers do? They detailed a few reasons. The first being that they never felt like they “needed” a cell phone at all, so by extension they never felt like they needed a smartphone. Alex thinks that generally, smartphones are “useless” to living, so they never felt compelled to buy something they didn’t feel a use for. They feel as though smartphones provide entertainment value, not survival value. Many people are so attached to their smartphones that they feel helpless in situations without them, however Alex firmly believes that they can can survive without a phone, and over the years they have never once felt compelled to “convert” to being a smartphone user. As a strong believer in their own self-sufficiency, Alex never wanted to depend on a machine built by someone else. Their main worry about using a smartphone would be the risk of becoming codependent on an inanimate device. They always want to maintain self-control and avoid the domestication of technology within their life. If smartphone technology became integrated within Alex’s daily routines and practices, that ideal of technological minimalism could be compromised.</p>
<p>Of course, Alex does use their Tracfone to communicate with the important people in their life. Yet even with the Tracfone, they don’t use it frivolously, and the frequency of use depends on context. For a specific example, last semester Alex had a group project in which they frequently had to communicate with their partner, so they used their phone for texting much more than they usually would. They would text the partner to discuss meeting or give an update, but that would be all. In terms of texting close friends, Alex prefers to call over text. They will call someone for a specific purpose, like confirming a plan, or other times just to chat, sometimes for a few hours. However, Alex strongly dislikes texting chit-chat; once everything that needed to be said has been said, they have no desire to continue idle banter over text. They have specific friends that they will call on their Tracfone most frequently, however they would always prefer to speak with friends in person given the situation allows for it (time,distance etc.). They also own a landline at school to call their mother, and state that they find the quality to be better.</p>
<p>In terms of communicating with their parents, that has never been a struggle. Alex got their first phone (the same Tracfone) at 18 years old, right before college. Growing up an only child, Alex’s parents could easily keep track of them, and never like their safety was compromised without a phone. In high school, they had a good group of friends and never felt like they missed out socially; they were always included in plans even without being easily contacted through a cell phone/texting. In college, Alex feels that any of their friendships that have come and gone are not the result of technology, but rather personal growth and change, and that most friendships are even stronger now. They may not be a part of group chats, or might miss inside jokes, but good friends will always keep Alex in the loop.</p>
<p>One very positive thing Alex also mentioned about not having a smartphone is that they avoid all of the negativity and drama that comes with social media, and not having be concerned with likes and followers and anything else that superficial and distracting from the real world. When Alex is out and about in the world, they want to actually enjoy it, and not be staring into the tiny screen in their hands. Because Alex doesn’t carry a smartphone with them when they go out, they have learned to be resourceful and to rely on their own set of skills instead of apps for everything. For example, they don’t need a tip calculator app, because they learned mental math tricks to figure it out quickly. When traveling or exploring, they don’t need Google/Apple Maps because they have good sense of direction, and can navigate using a paper map very well. They also feel like not having a smartphone makes them more organized, because they have learned to utilize a paper calendar and planner. They look at it every day and are never late to any appointments. They rely on their own memory and efficiency, as opposed to constant push notifications popping on their screen to remind them of their priorities. Alex feels as though having a smartphone would actually cause them more stress and anxiety, as it would just be cluttered and distracting.</p>
<p>However, there are some technological devices that Alex does use for entertainment and distraction. They have an MP3 player for listening to music. And aside from homework, emails, and other school/work related things, they use their computer for watching videos on youtube, internet window shopping, gaming etc. They also game on their PS3 and Nintendo DS. They explained how they think video games are a lot like phones, and can be great to enjoy in moderation. Alex’s views are not anti-technology, but rather anti-human dependence on smartphones. If people have weak self-control, have debilitating insecurities, or a strong need for validation, then their smartphones may be doing much more harm than good. Alex believes that sometimes we let smartphones use us, instead of us using it. Alex is proof that smartphone technology does not have to be domesticated into our everyday lives if we do not wish to allow it. Humans can be perfectly content, and even thrive, without the constant presence of a smartphone.</p>
