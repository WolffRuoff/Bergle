								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Think about how many times a day you read. From the moment you wake up, you are reading everything from street signs to text messages, from newspapers to billboards. People constantly complain about having to read, despite the fact that reading is extremely crucial to our existence. If no one was able to read, it would be very hard to function in society. Mike Hanksi informs us just how important reading is in his article <i>Want to Be a Better Writer? Read More.</i> Within his opening he states,“Reading is fashionable. Again. It’s cool. We bet you can all find many statements about how good and useful reading is, how much it can influence a person and his way of thinking… ” (Hanski, 2014).</p>
<p>If someone explained to you exactly how to be a great writer, would you listen? If they laid everything out, would you follow through? Hanski does just this. He depicts the sole way to becoming a successful writer is by reading. By doing this, one will become more educated and discover inspiration. Ideas obtained through reading will only increase your ability when writing. Reading can make your brain function stronger; it exercises your mind and circulates blood flow to the brain. From there it continues with reducing the likelihood of contracting Alzheimer’s disease and even makes a person more sympathetic. The benefits of reading are endless, so why would one not take that chance and run with it. It’s a no brainer to utilize reading as a tool to just make your writing exceptional and to improve your quality of life.  Mike quotes famous author Stephen King,“ If you don’t have the time to read, you don’t have the time (or the tools) to write. Simple as that” (Hanski, 2014). Even a well renowned, published author agrees with Hanski that reading is quite an essential aspect of being a great writer.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Reading and writing are essential to everyday living. If you knew that just sitting down and reading a book would help with over coming things like stress or decreasing your chances of having Alzheimer’s disease, would you do it then? According to scientists, reading helps strengthen your brain and increase the blood flow which is beneficial. But if you’re able to sit down and read something that you are interested in then why not just read? If you are stressed out, read. Getting older or contracting Alzheimer’s disease could be helped just by picking up a book or reading the news paper. Its not proven that it will cure those things, but if it helps why no try it. Many people say they don&#8217;t have the time to read or they just don&#8217;t like to read, but why not just try it for twenty minuets; it is a way to escape the world for a little bit and learn new things. Hanski seems to think that reading is what shapes us. He also thinks it helps us with understanding our feelings, figuring out who we are and opening us up to all new things.</p>
<p>School is something that we all do not get excited about, but our teachers give us massive reading assessments that is helping us in the long run; however, the readings they give us are usually the cause of our stress. So maybe taking a step back from that reading assignment and clearing are minds and then getting back to it will help. No matter what, we have to read it but it makes a difference what attitude that you have towards the reading. If it is something you don&#8217;t want to do, then you are not going to be interested and get stressed out but if you look at it in a positive way then it might not be as bad. We go to school so that we can get a good education and get a good job to live a happy life well, to do all that we need to know how to read and write. So when looking at homework or a book that we don&#8217;t want to read, we are helping our brains out and making them stronger so that we can live out the lives that we all think about living.</p>
<p>Hanski wrote about one issue in his article and that was if you can’t read you are not going to fit in to a social environment. Everyone needs to read; You might not be the best reader out there but you still need to be able to read so you can complete everyday tasks. But reading could easily help you be successful in life. Mostly any job you get you will need to be able to read and write. Reading and writing is not only important for a job but also in who you become. “It helps us understand all feelings and events, it makes us better, it teaches us to respect people, it broadens our minds, and it opens out hearts to everything new.” (Mike Hanski, page 3) Hanski’s article makes you realize that reading is truly important and essential to our life. Without reading and writing we all might not be the bright people that we are today.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this article, Mike Hanski uncovers the ways in which reading can positively impact not only a person’s writing skills, but also a person’s quality of life. Hanski continuously argues that writing is not teachable and “can’t be got by simple learning of grammar rules, punctuation marks, and different writing techniques.” (Hanski, 2014, p.1). It seems that the only way to truly grasp the art of writing is to read other authors’ works and gain insight on the different techniques, wide array of vocabulary, and overall structure used.</p>
<p>In my personal experience, reading benefitted my writing skills greatly in taking the SATs last year. I dreaded opening the first page of my booklet to the 25-minute essay being that I was never prepared for what kind of prompt would be thrown at me. Most times, I would not be able to formulate my ideas concisely or even have any ideas at all for that matter. After receiving a 7 out of 12 my first time around, I took the initiative and decided it would be a good idea to read graded example essays that other students had written. I read essays that scored a 2 all the way to essays that scored a perfect 12. In doing this, I learned how to properly analyze all different types of prompts. I was able to recognize repeating patterns in both the low-scoring essays and high-scoring essays and eventually pinpoint my own mistakes. On the next SAT I took, I put to use all of the knowledge I gained from reading the sample essays and scored a 10 out of 12. Doing well on my essay helped me get a high overall SAT score, which helped me get into a good college, which will hopefully give me plenty of job opportunities in the future.</p>
<p>Not only does reading affect a person’s caliber of writing, but it “helps kids define who they are, as it connects them to the rest of the whole world” (Hanski, 2014, p.2). By widening a student’s vocabulary and deepening their knowledge, it is inevitable that they will become more well-versed and understanding of the world. Hanski explains that without these vital tools, social exclusion is a very plausible possibility. “Pupils who are functionally illiterate at 16 consider school a simple waste of time and become most likely unemployed by the age of 30, as they do not believe anything they do can have a real effect on their lives” (Hanski, 2014, p.2).</p>
<p>It is truly mind-blowing how the simple act of reading can influence a person’s life so positively or so negatively.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Reading, often viewed as a dreadful act by students, is much more than just a means of getting individuals to remember the information being presented. As Mike Hanski writes in a piece for the <em>Huffington Post</em>, reading plays a pivotal role in molding the type of writer a person becomes. According to Hanski (2014, p. 1), writing is not a skill that can simply be attained by the memorization of grammatical rules, punctuation marks, and various writing styles. Rather, one becomes a phenomenal writer by reading. Studies have shown that reading produces a source of inspiration for many, leads to increased knowledge, prepares children for school, enables writers to understand their readers, and does much more. Additionally, reading “makes our lives easier” in the long run (Hanski, 2014, p. 3). Hanski (2014, p.3) notes that reading is responsible for broadening our minds, opening our hearts to new things, and teaching us to respect others.</p>
<p>In the grand scheme of things, reading is not so bad. The path to communicating with others effectively starts with reading “as it connects [people] to the rest of the whole world” (Hanski, 2014, p. 2). Communication can be considered more crucial in today’s society than it has ever been before. With so many different communication platforms around, one is constantly expected to be able to convey his/her thoughts. However, several means of modern communication would not be possible without writing. Take email and social media sites such as Twitter and Facebook as prime examples. As people communicate via email, Twitter, and Facebook, they write down their thoughts electronically. While much of what is posted to Twitter and Facebook is written informally by misinformed people, there are instances when individuals make valid points. These points are typically well-thought-out and well-written. This type of writing, as Hanski (2014, p.1) points out, would not be possible without people first making the effort to read about their topic of discussion.</p>
<p>If everyone decided that reading was futile, people would constantly be uninformed about prevalent issues. Moreover, communication between friends, family, high-level business executives, teachers, students, and even the president of the United States and the general public could not exist, as it does today, without individuals first taking the time to read. Just as Hanski (2014, p. 2) writes, one should take the time to read something that he/she enjoys. A person will ultimately find that he/she is not only better equipped to discuss what has been read, but to write about it as well.</p>
