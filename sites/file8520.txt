								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Social Media is a lethal weapon. When hearing this statement some people might be puzzled trying to figure out what it might mean. Although people may feel that social media is amazing for its ability to give each person who it is accessible to a voice, this is far from the case. Facebook and Twitter, two of the most popular social networking sites that we use in our everyday lives are flooded with terroristic propaganda used to help benefit various terrorist organizations. A book published by the United States government titled, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">The Evolution of Terrorist Propaganda: The Paris Attack and Social Media, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> talks about the growing concern over terrorist organizations’ ability to use social media. The book continues to talk about the knowledge that terrorist organizations have as it says, “Terrorists know the benefit of social media. Social Media is easy to use, it is free, and it reaches everyone in the world,”(1). ISIS , who has recently come into view for the United States government and its citizens, uses social media to broadcast their horrible videos that show their terrible acts to the entire world. ISIS uses these videos in an attempt to recruit new members to their “caliphate” not just in the Middle East, but around the world due to the abilities of social media. With a growing terrorist organization presence on Twitter and Facebook, these companies and the United States are faced with a huge dilemma. Should they do whatever it takes to remove all the content posted by terrorist organizations to prevent recruitment or should they leave the content so they can use it for intelligence to help stop the terrorist organizations. The United States and Social Media companies must figure out a strategy to help improve this issue. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As the reading continues, it talks about occurrences where terrorist groups have used social media. Twitter has run into major problems with terrorist groups being on their website such as, “for years Twitter was asked to shut down an account of the foreign terrorist organization al- Shabaab, which pledged allegiance to al-Qaeda,”(2). In 2013, al-Shabaab’s account live tweeted their attack on the Westgate Mall in Kenya that killed 72 people. By Twitter not listening to these complaints, they let a terrorist organization live tweet so the rest of the world was able to see , which could have easily been prevented by Twitter. The reading continued to talk about the negatives of social media saying, “the use of Internet to radicalize and recruit homegrown terrorists is the single most important and dangerous innovation since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Approaches that are aimed at reducing the supply of violent extremist content on the Internet are neither feasible nor desirable.’’ The United States and other nations know that they are fighting a very tough battle against terrorists organization on social networking websites. In my opinion, these sites should look to eliminate every terrorist affiliated page. ISIS’ main strength is its ability to recruit and send messages using social media. I feel that if companies like Facebook and Twitter could cut off ISIS’ ability to use social media, their efforts would be extremely weakened. Having information about terrorist organizations like ISIS by using their posts can be beneficial, but the United States has been very good at knowing where and when ISIS mobilizes and with drone technology they are able to attack without sending military personnel to the battlefield to fight. United States citizens have also began to try to join the ISIS caliphate. Many of these people have been caught before being able to travel to Syria to join, but some have been successful in their efforts. Social media is the reason for this willingness to join ISIS. The United States and social networking websites have made strides to help put an end to terrorist organization’s ability to share their ideas and messages with the world,  but it will be a long, hard battle that the United States and the rest of the world will continue to fight.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The concepts of identity, self-promotion, and manipulation of an intended audience are significant aspects of the Twitter world. Users have become addicted to the “micro-celebrity” (Marwick 121) social status and are feeding off of their, “audience that they can strategically maintain through ongoing communication and interaction” (Marwick 121). It’s interesting to see the different goals that each Twitter user has in mind when posting tweets for the public to see. Some users, such as giant corporations, use specific marketing tactics to manipulate users and appeal to a niche’s specific interests. “Soraya Darabi, the social media strategist for the New York Times, said, ‘I’m constantly aware of my followers.’” (Marwick 126) She is the perfect example of what it looks like to have an inauthentic goal in mind when tweeting, for she creates an explicit social image for the sole purpose of gaining followers and possible fiscal rewards. Soraya Darabi does not use Twitter for her own personal self expression, her decision, “to reveal personal information”, is, “strategic, and often framed as a way to reinforce relationships with followers” (Marwick 127). This contrasts with individuals who do not have a lot of followers because their “audience awareness”, does not, “factor greatly into their writing” (Marwick 116). Twitter users who do not have many followers “see Twitter as a personal space” (Marwick 124), in which authenticity is maintained and balanced with impression management.</p>
<p>The audience also plays a large role in the kinds of tweets produced. Since users can not actually comprehend the extent of their audience, “a tweets actual readers differ from its producer’s imagined audience” (Marwick 117). Between other social platforms that allow the share feature, tweets can be seen on countless, “communication channels” (Marwick 117), which can be daunting to the Twitter user but also be used to one’s advantage. There are many different perspectives on the kinds of tweets on the internet. Factors such as censorship, the intended audience, and the appeal to multiple audiences are all taken into consideration while tweeting. This is important to Twitter users because they do not want to be chastised for a specific tweet that was posted but then shared to an unintended audience that does not agree with the user’s views.</p>
<p>While the knowledge of having an intended audience is very important for successful Twitter users, the ability to navigate multiple twitter communities also comes into play when focusing on identity. The phenomenon of context collapse describes how the requirement to display a, “verifiable, singular identity makes it impossible to differ self-presentation strategies, creating tension as diverse groups of people flock to social network sites (boyd, 2008)” (Marwick 122). The public can not tell the difference between self-promotion and commercialization versus one’s authentic self and personal expression. Erving Goffman highlights the interesting analogy between twitter users and actors, for each tweet is a performance intended for a specific audience and group of people, especially noting the fact that, “self-presentation is collaborative” (Marwick 123). Just the way an actor can not perform without an audience, a twitter user can not post a tweet without a group of people to see and interact with it. This public presentation of various narrative can lead to criticism, “encourage social norms” (Marwick 123), and provoke an unwanted reputation for a given user. These consequences of tweeting reinforce the idea of, “’impression management’” (Marwick 123), but also sheds a light on the relationship between social media and identity and how people can accidentally create an unwanted identity for themselves.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have we really reached a world that we might have to start using social Media to enhance our learning? Technology has already changed the way kids are learning so I couldn’t imagine kids using social media to learn. Using social media to learn would be very hard to do because kids most likely do not even focus on the work they would be reading up on their news feeds and talking to friends, but in the same senses I feel that kids would absorb information if it was laid out in social media. If your class was set up as a twitter feed I’m sure many kids would have such an easy time navigating through the work. It would be very interesting to see someone try to set a class up like that, or even if it was set up as Facebook.</p>
<p>But social media can be used in many other different ways for learning. Like in the article “Twitter for teaching: Can social media be used to enhance the process of learning?” Chris Evans does research to see if Twitter helps enhances the process of learning, but he uses students who have never used twitter before. It is interesting to see students who haven’t used twitter before become introduced to it in an educational way.</p>
<p>Evans has the students interact with their tutor over twitter using hashtags so that it is easy for the tutors to be able to go and look at what each student is asking. Evans asks in his research if this replaces kids being able to go to class, which he showed that it doesn’t cause even though the students question or concern might be answered, it can never replace the act of walking in to a class and sitting down for a lecture. Social media can never replace the act of going in to a classroom and having a face to face interaction with a teacher or professor.</p>
<p>Evans studied many different aspects of twitter and educations and he figured out that yes it did help students get more evolved and engage in what they were learning. But you will never be able to replace the classroom, social media will be able to help enhance learning. But I don’t think it will ever replace it.</p>
<p>This is something that as my generation gets older should start paying attention to because there might be a day where our kids don’t even go and sit in a class room. They will be learning everything online. They might not even know what a text book is because they will most likely be caring around a tablet or some technological devices that holds all their information that they need.</p>
<p>Our parents telling us how they remember a day without all this technology, we will be saying to our kids how we remember the days of text books and sitting in classrooms. At some point though I think someone will need to step in and make sure that the idea of sitting in a class room remains that way. Because we don’t want future generations not learning how to socialize in person and not getting those learning experiences that we get.</p>
<p>The movement of technology needs to start slowing down and we need to start looking at how much time we spend already looking at a screen. Its unhealthy and the last thing I would want is to be taking classes all online and using social media to help.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A selfie,“A self portrait photograph, typically taken with a digital camera or a camera phone held by the hand or supported by a selfie stick” (Selfie, 2015). All people, whether they want to admit it or not, have taken a selfie at one point in their life. It may have been for their followers on Instagram, or maybe to their best friend on Snapchat. Regardless of the recipient or the purpose, the selfie was still taken.</p>
<p>The world may think the selfie was introduced only a few years ago, but in reality the concept is ancient. The first selfie was technically taken in 1839 by famous photographer, Robert Cornelius. He used the first photographic process, known as daguerreotypy. This process however was much different from the selfie today. The photographer figured out that the process was so slow that he could start the camera, enter the frame, and then exit the frame (Selfie, 2015). Essentially, he was able to take a self portrait by himself. As time went on, the selfie continued to evolve. “The debut of the portable Kodak brownie box camera in 1900 led to photographic self portrait  becoming a more widespread technique” (Selfie, 2015). The photographer would position themselves in front of a mirror to capture their self portrait.</p>
<p>The selfie that we have grown to know started off as the typical Myspace picture. &#8220;An amateurish, flash-blinded self-portrait, often taken in front of a bathroom mirror” (Selfie, 2015). However these mirror pictures didn’t last forever. Once Facebook began overshadowing Myspace, the concept had morphed once again. User’s selfies were becoming more classy and well planned out. Digital cameras and camera phones were now obsolete due to the new technologies that housed front facing cameras.</p>
<p>Selfies were taken to a whole new level. They started out as just a profile picture on a social media site and evolved into a daily act for a lot of people. Well planned selfies are taken to get on likes on Instagram, ugly selfies are taken to send to friends on Snapchat, and group selfies are taken to capture memories. In just a few short years, the idea of the selfie we knew exploded. “The popularity of selfies in social media has been astounding. Instagram has over 53 million photos tagged with the hashtag #selfie. The word ‘selfie’ was mentioned in Facebook status updates over 368,000 times during a one-week period in October 2013. During the same period on Twitter, the hashtag #selfie was used in more than 150,000 tweets” (Selfie, 2015).</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you have a twitter account or are involved in any type of social media, you have probably seen a “hashtag” before. We know hashtags most popularly as simple ways for people to search for tweets that have a common theme or topic. “Hashtags can be used to collect public opinion on events and ideas at the local, corporate, or world level” (&#8220;Hashtag&#8221;, 2015). For example, if you wanted to see people’s opinions of Donald Trump, you could simply search #DonaldTrump in the twitter search bar and get an entire feed of tweets pertaining to him. Hashtags are used for a variety of reasons and if promoted by enough people, can even “trend” and therefore attract more people to the topic at hand.</p>
<p>While many people may believe the “hashtag” originated on Twitter, it is actually not a Twitter function. Also known as the “number sign,” hashtags were first used in information technology to highlight a specific meaning. For example, “In 1978, Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie used # in the C programming language for special keywords that had to be processed first by the C preprocessor” (&#8220;Hashtag&#8221;, 2015). Later on, IRC networks began to use number signs to label channels or topics. A man named Chris Messina was inspired by the IRC and proposed a similar system to be used on Twitter, tweeting, “how do you feel about using # (pound) for groups. As in #barcamp?” (&#8220;Hashtag&#8221;, 2015) on August 23, 2007. This proposal became extremely popular and continued to grow as Twitter began to hyperlink all hashtags and eventually introduce “Trending Topics” on its front page. Hashtags are now used on a variety of different platforms, including Instagram, YouTube, Google, and even on television.</p>
<p>Businesses and advocacy organizations have especially taken advantage of the “hashtag” by connecting the popularity of social media with the promotion of their products, services, or campaigns. For example, “There is a collaboration between the social networking site Twitter and American Express that makes it possible to buy discounted goods online by tweeting a special hashtag. American Express members can sync their card with Twitter and use the offers by tweeting and look for a response in a tweet with the confirmation from American Express” (&#8220;Hashtag&#8221;, 2015). Not only can hashtags positively affect a business’ market, but they can also be used with a negative connotation, where they are better known as “bashtags.” Nowadays, it is extremely common for people to use social media platforms in order to complain about poor customer service or to criticize a company. Hashtags have the power of drawing attention to important issues and controversial topics.</p>
<p>Overall, people have found a countless amount of ways to use hashtags for their own benefit; whether to spark a conversation, start a trend, gain more followers, or to promote a specific event or campaign. For better or for worse, hashtags have become extremely powerful tools not only in social media, but in our everyday lives.</p>
