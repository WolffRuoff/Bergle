								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">         The first chapter of It’s Complicated explains the difficulty of trying to create a persona on social media because everyone perceives things differently. This chapter discusses an example where a girl was tagged in a photo holding a beer on Facebook. Although she did not post the photo, friends were notified that she was tagged in it. To most people this picture creates a poor image of the girl ;however, it is just a photo and viewers are not clear of the context. She may have been holding the drink for a friend, but not enough information is given to understand what is happening. In chapter 1 boyd (2014) states, “ Without a shared sense of context, hanging out online becomes burdensome. “ (p. 36) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">            People are very quick to judge online and there is not much room for explanation. There is no way to know how a post can be perceived by everyone and therefore there is no way to insure that it is perceived correctly. One quick tweet or post on instagram and the rumor mills have started. One person screenshots the post and declares her opinion about the post and it is then spread like wildfire. People thrive on gossip and they read too much into posts that were supposed to be fun and lighthearted. This is the black hole of society. Everybody assumes without thinking. Everyone judges without questioning. These mistakes that we all make are much harder to make in person as you simply ask a question as the conversation flows.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">            There is no conversation on social media, only little bits and pieces that have no context or room for question and answer. How do we fix this? Boyd repetitively mentioned how social media is a challenge; a challenge to our identity and a challenge to our peers. Is this a challenge we should try to overcome or  should we take after </span><span style="font-weight: 400"> Brian O’Neill,  in the article </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Teens Who Say No To Social Media,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> who chose to talk in person with his friends and avoid social media all together.
