								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As society is evolving so is social medias language. Through the internet people have discovered new ways to communicate easily while not actually having to use full coherent sentences. Chapter six in <em>How Blogs and Twitter Ate Transforming Popular Culture </em>written by Mary Cross, she states “Without editors or gatekeepers, language on the Internet is in constant flux, experimental at best, ungrammatical at worst” (2011, p 85). Visual information gets to the brain a lot faster so social media has been able to translate words and emotions into emoticons. Through emoticons one is able to express their emotions and thoughts to friends or family in a quick and easy to understand manner. It is very hard for people to read a tone text message, you may send a message with a joking tone but the receivers might take it the wrong way and think you were being rude or overly sarcastic. With emotions and expressions being translated into emoticons it makes it easier for people to be able to get a sense of the text messages tone because a quick smiley face at the end of the sentence can go along way.</p>
<p>A huge theme that is constantly changing over the years is the use of slang words. As culture evolves so does slang, there will always be more words that are “in” during that year. This year specifically those words consisted of “no chill”, “FOMO”, “turnt”, “on fleek”, “bae”, “yas”, and many more. There have been people looking into whether or not slang effects the way one writes essays and complete assignments but some say other wise, “Yet experts who study these things say that language offline has not ben measurably affected, that students can still put together coherent papers in full sentences, and, even, that all the extra writing they are doing online is improving their mastery of written langue” (2011, p 86). Even thought students these days use slang more often than not it has not yet effect our ability to write properly. It is important that as our culture changes we do not begin slipping away from the English grammar and spelling, we cannot let slang take over the English dictionary.</p>
<p>Chapter six also touches upon a major theme in that there is a difference between the male language and female language. In regard to the use of emoticons and slang females tend to have more length texts apply more emoticons where as males tend to be more short and to the point with less use of emoticons. On a more serious note when it comes to proper English and professional writings there were specific difference brought to my attention through this chapter. Linguistics professor Naomi S Baron, who is the author of <em>Always on </em>states that, “Women also tend to use more qualifiers, are more polite, stick to standard usage, and use conversation to enhance social interactions, while men converse to convey information” (2011, p 90). Over all I agree with this statement however I do not believe that men only talk to convey information, I feel as though women are more polite than men by using conversation to interact but men also do that too, just not as often. Baron also touches upon the fact that women tend to disguise themselves online so that they are able to speak out loud with out getting bashed on the internet however this is not what women should have to do to speak their mind.</p>
<p>Again as society begins to develop so does our language, so it is important that we do not let slang get in the way of being professional students nor let society gender norms hold you back from expressing our own thoughts to the public.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Way too often does Apple come out with a new “must have” product. The most recent product is the iPhone 6S, but that’s not what I am here to discuss, it is all about the new Apple Watch product. Its price ranges from a reasonable $349 to an outrageous $17,000, “The fancy cases and straps are nice, but it’s the software that I’m sold on” (OCHS, 2015). Does not matter the strap fabric its the content that the watch is able to provide you which makes you forget about your previous desire to have the fanciest watch. With just a few swipes left and right, up and down you basically have your phone smashed into a small square on your wrist. You receive notifications just as you would on your iPhone. Siri, Apple Pay, Phone, Messages, Mail, and Calendar are all accessible through the easy use of your new Apple Watch. Everything works so smoothly and easily you quickly forget and don’t even care about what the mere strap is made out of, it is all about the technology itself. Even with all of these perks of having an Apple Watch there were minor concerns. The battery life like many technological products is something customers worry about. OCHS was one of those worrying customers, “Apple is good about not overestimating battery life and from what I saw in my demo, these figures seem reasonable. The watch is designed to get you the info you want quickly, both in how the information is presented and how easy it is to move between it” (OCHS, 2015). The Apple Watch highlights the quick fast motions and minimal time taking it requires to access any apple, this allows customers to find what they are looking for in record timing only using up little battery life at a time.</p>
<p>As more people begin to purchase Apple Watches the amount of time people spend on their cell phone may actually reduce. Everyday people check their phones constantly whether or not they are waiting for a text, or checking social media, or trying to call someone, people are on their phones way too much and thats that, me included of course. With notifications that are sent to your phone but received on your Apple Watch the constant pulling out the cell phone may not stay such a bad habit.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>People today have grown up putting their everyday lives on social media. Everything that they have done and want people to know have gone up on some sort of social media whether it was a Facebook post, a tweet, a Snapchat story, or an Instagram photo, it was almost as they have to share their successes and experiences with their peers. But it is crucial to remember that once you upload something onto the internet it is never really gone.</p>
<p>This is where cyberstalking can come into place, cyberstalking is when an individual or group use the internet to stalk or harass an individual. Most cyberstalking is intended as an act of revenge or blackmail towards an individual or group who want something and intend to get it at all costs. With peoples lives on the internet it is very easy for hackers or even people without any hacking skills to retrieve data about someone that may be used to blackmail or harass someone with. With bad cases of cyber stalking generally the stalking moves from online to real life. The Wikipedia mentioned, “Even police and prosecutors find themselves at risk, as gang members ad other organized criminals find out where they live—often to intimidate them into dropping a case” (Cyberstalking, 2015). Gangs find a way whether or not it is through the internet or in person to locate their target and track them down in order to harass or even threaten the individual to back off. “[A] final report states that approximately 1.2 million victims had stalkers who used technology to find them” (“Cyberstalking, 2015). This is why it is important to be careful online because when people start to become reckless and don’t take certain precautions when posting something online they are an easy target for people to take advantage of. However not all cyberstalking is used to the extreme like these gangs, there is cyber trolling. It is important to distinguish the difference because trolling is generally harmless where as stalking is more persistent and causes problems for the victim.</p>
<p>As teenagers most would end up cyber trolling, it is very common for you to end up on someone’s Facebook page and then then see someone really pretty or attractive and then go to their page and so on so forth. Soon enough you might find yourself on your friends best friends, dads cousins friends daughters profile without even realizing how many people you have gone through. It’s easy to get caught up in the moment of innocent stalking but it is important to realize that attackers are able to do this but with a higher purpose in mind.</p>
<p>Over all it is important that you monitor what you put online because attackers will find a way to cyber stalk you and collect information that is just meant for friends and families to see, only for people you trust.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In society today I am almost positive that most teenagers can’t even fathom a day without social media and their personal cellphones. We spend half our day on our phones looking through social media and texting such as Instagram, Facebook, and SnapChat. A new and upcoming social media app, Yik Yak allows users to post anonymously thoughts and comments about anything they please. It was created in 2013 by Tyler Droll and Brooks Buffington who were recent graduates at Furman University. According to Mahler, Droll and Buffington, “came up with the ideas after realizing that there were only a handful of popular Twitter accounts at Furman…they hoped to created a more democratic social media network, one where users didn’t need a large number of followers or friends to have their posts read widely” (Mahler, 2015, p.1). This is a valid reason because social media today is all about likes and how many followers you have. On Snapchat I hear people rave about how many people have seen their story and on Instagram how many likes they got within a certain time span. Not having to make a Yik Yak profile allows anyone and everyone around your area to see your thoughts not just people who follow you or you may know personally. While it is a good way to get your thoughts out anonymously it is used way too many times to put out negative comments about people or things.</p>
<p>In this article Jonathan Mahler interviewed a professor who filed multiple complaints about inappropriate things said about her on Yik Yak that her students posted about her. Unfortunately, nothing was done about it because the selling feature of Yik Yak is that ever post is completely anonymous making it impossible to find the person responsible for the inappropriate posts. Colleges have no control to students from accessing Yik Yak because if they just block access through their Wi-Fi networks students can easily just use their cell service which colleges have no control over. This is a huge issue because today so many people are targeted through cyber bullying. Having Yik Yak completely anonymous has its ups and downs, it allows people to ask questions that may be too uncomfortable to ask if their identity was exposed to the pubic. However cyber attacks that happened to the professor at Michigan are much easier to execute with rarely any consequences.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Writing is a huge part of society today making it an important skill people should be able to master. Hanski emphasizes on the importance of reading and how it directly affects a person’s ability to write. Writing is a skill that is not picked up easily, a lot of time and effort has to be put into it to become a thoughtful writer. Hanski mentions many different positive results by reading more but there was one result that he emphasized repeatedly, “Writing is a skill…It provides you with wider vocabulary for your own works” (Hanski, 2014 p.1). By reading more you are exposing yourself to vast quantities of different vocabulary that you might not have heard of before. This allows you to look up and learn new words and then apply them to different situations overall improving your ability to write.</p>
<p>Throughout the article Hanski uses various positive words such as “cool”, “cozy”, and “fashionable” (Hanski 2014) in order to grab the reader’s attention and put a positive light on reading. As you expand your vocabulary dictionary you are exposed to different ways to express things. Even though the vocabulary in Hanskis’ article is simple, without knowing those specific simple words he would not have been able to put reading into such a positive light.</p>
<p>Straying away from Hanskis’ multiple use of positive words he also repeatedly uses vocabulary that emphasize on growth, “Reading widens and vocabulary, broadens a kid’s mind, helps him understand the world better” (Hanski, 2014 p.2). I think Hanski highlights growth by using the terms “widens” and “broaden” which both show the reader that by reading your writing skill can easily improve. I felt that this was an effective way to grab the reader’s attention because like me, some people don’t get the same rush of enjoyment from reading/writing as others but when I was done with Hanskis’ article I felt motivated to read more than I have in the past.</p>
