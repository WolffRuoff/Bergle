Kan, M. April 27, 2011. China&#8217;s Baidu Revenue, Profits Up on Strong Traffic Growth.<em> Network World</em>. Retried from <a href="http://www.networkworld.com/news/2011/042811-chinas-baidu-revenue-profits-up.html">http://www.networkworld.com/news/2011/042811-chinas-baidu-revenue-profits-up.html</a></p>
<p>Google dominants search in nearly every corner of the world, except in one: China. Google’s forays into the lucrative Chinese internet search marketplace, which is estimated at 457 million users, have captured less than 20% of the market. Baidu, an eleven year old competitor, offers many similar services to those provided by Google, yet has gained a significant market share by leveraging linking pin power roles. For instance, Baidu is the “default search engine in 80 percent of Andriod phones in China&#8230;because the mobile operating system is open-source software, device manufactures can make changes to it.” Baidu is pre-installed on devices through revenue sharing agreements with manufacturers.</p>
<p><span id="more-1182"></span></p>
<p>Baidu’s power as a exhibitor in the Chinese search market exceeds that of Google in the Unted States (approx. 65%), and rivals Google’s dominance in Europe (closer to 80%). This runs in paradox to the belief that American media power tends to be more concentrated than the European media system. The internet industry differs in this regard from traditional media. One reason may be the entrepreneurial spirit in the United States encourages more imitators and competitors; backed by venture capital firms (an important investor power role in the internet industry) that provide billions of dollars annually to internet start ups.</p>

<p>Once upon a time, the task of finding a seat in the theater after the movie had already begun proved to be an impossible task. However, now finding an empty seat is becoming less of a challenge. It has been a grim first quarter of the year for both Hollywood studios and theater owners. For every single weekend of the year thus far, box office revenues have dropped from the equivalent weekends in 2010. At CinemaCon, a convention of the National Association of Theater Owners (NATO) that recently took place in Las Vegas, the box office decline was a prominent topic of conversation.  Not only are consumer habits changing constantly, but last year&#8217;s box office hits &#8220;Avatar&#8221; (2009) and &#8220;Alice in Wonderland&#8221; (2010) drove the box office to record highs during the first half of 2010. And so far this year, there has been a lack of &#8220;event films&#8221; able to rake in large numbers of ticket sales and attract audiences in a way comparable to last year. <span id="more-1062"></span></p>
<p>At CinemaCon, much of the conference&#8217;s discussion has centered around hopes that this summer&#8217;s films will help erase some of the box office deficit. With known properties and sequels such as &#8220;Scream 4,&#8221; &#8220;Fast Five,&#8221; &#8220;Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,&#8221; &#8220;The Hangover Part II,&#8221; &#8220;Cars 2,&#8221; &#8220;Transformers 3,&#8221; and the final installment of &#8220;Harry Potter&#8221; due in theaters between now and July, Hollywood is hoping that moviegoers will be lured back to theaters to see follow-ups to previous successes.  Several of the major studios, including Paramount, DreamWorks, Disney, Warner Bros. and Lionsgate showcased some of their upcoming products at the convention. Sony screened an entire film, the July comedy &#8220;Zookeeper&#8221; starring Kevin James.</p>
<p>CinemaCon, which used to be known as ShoWest, conducted its first-ever conference under that name this year. In an effort to increase studio participation at the conference and encourage attendance among smaller film exhibitors, NATO will begin managing the conference on a non-profit basis. During a time when decreased attendance and other factors have contributed more than ever to box office declines, CinemaCon was an important week for exhibitors as they discussed strategies and changing consumer habits. &#8220;In this day and age, with so many ancillary avenues fighting for the leisure dollar, we have to be at the top of our game,&#8221; said CinemaCon managing director Mitch Neuhauser. &#8220;That&#8217;s really what we&#8217;re keying the conference on: What does it take?&#8221;</p>
<p>As we discussed in our blog last week, a new premium video-on-demand service is proving controversial in the motion picture industry. Making feature films available on demand in a relatively short window following release, this service was a notable point of conversation about CinemaCon. The video-on-demand service is reflective of some of the changes happening within the entertainment industry that could affect how consumers are willing to spend their money. It remains to be seen what kind of impact this specific service will actually have on box office revenues, but it seems clear at this point in time that exhibitors and studios are both counting on the box office receiving a much-needed shot in the arm.</p>
<p>The sheer number of films being released in this summer based on products that previously saw success is an indication that studios are hoping familiarity will bring people back into movie theaters. CinemaCon is a clear example of a power role attempting to maintain their grip on the industry. Exhibitors spent the entire week of CinemaCon discussing the ins and outs of the industry and the current state of box office sales. CinemaCon was an outlet that allowed not only the screening of footage but gave exhibitors and studios a chance to interact. With the common goal of boosting box office and erasing some of the industry&#8217;s current fears, exhibitors and studios used CinemaCon as an opportunity to plan for the future.</p>

<p><a href="http://mediaindustries11.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/03/home_theter_04-535x354.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1018" src="http://mediaindustries11.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/03/home_theter_04-535x354-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a>In a controversial business venture that could significantly impact the film industry and its audiences, four major film studios have announced their involvement in the launch of Home Premiere, a premium video-on-demand service for feature films. Beginning next month, Warner Bros., Sony, Universal and 20th Century Fox will offer recently released theatrical films for a $30 fee over a two-to-three day viewing period, at the discretion of each particular studio. Several cable systems will offer the service, with DirecTV launching it initially to its 20 million customers. Warner Bros.&#8217; action thriller &#8220;Unknown&#8221; (2011) and Sony&#8217;s romantic comedy &#8220;Just Go With It&#8221; (2011) will be the first major releases offered via Home Premiere. While discussing the reasons this endeavor has come to fruition, studios have argued that offering these films for the $30 rate 60 days after theatrical release will <em>not</em> harm either box office returns or the financial stability of exhibitors, claiming that films make most of their money at the box office within the first three months. Further, these studios claim that the expense of a night out at the movies for families has harmed them financially between the cost of concessions, tickets, and possible babysitters, and this VOD service seeks to appease this by offering an opportunity to view relatively recent films at a cost that would be lower than an average trip to the theater.<span id="more-1016"></span></p>
<p>However, exhibitors and NATO (the National Association of Theater Owners) have expressed disappointment and anger over their fears of this premium VOD plan having a negative effect on theaters. In a statement, a NATO spokesman recently said, &#8220;They risk damaging theatrical revenues without actually delivering what  the home consumer seems to want, which is flexibility, portability and a  low price. These plans fundamentally alter the economic relationship  between exhibitors, filmmakers and producers, and the studios taking  part in this misguided venture.&#8221; In other words, a prominent concern of the exhibition viewpoint of the industry regards possible repercussions this new service could have on theatrical box office revenues.</p>
<p>Several theater chains, including Regal Entertainment, have threatened studios with the possibility of not releasing particular films if they are released on demand just six weeks after opening. Hypothetically, if Regal were to actually go through with this, it would have a devastating effect on nearly all theatrical grosses, as Regal is the largest theater chain in the U.S. When DirecTV initially proposed the VOD launch in February, they had mentioned the possibility of a short four-to-six week window between theatrical release and VOD release. This was when Regal threatened a boycott, and the four major studios had to intervene and talk DirecTV into lengthening the window to 60 days.</p>
<p>This is a striking example of power roles at work in the industry of motion pictures. In terms of the agreement to extend the window to 60 days from roughly 40, the exhibitors wielded their power over the distributors. Without the cooperation of Regal, the nation&#8217;s most prominent movie exhibitor chain, the studios would stand to lose millions of dollars in this risky endeavor. Although the exhibitors and NATO still seem unsure of Home Premiere&#8217;s possible financial implications, they are nonetheless on board with it, at least for now. It remains to be seen what the future holds for this new service, and whether it will be profitable overall or a financial bust. In the meantime, however, the fight between the different entities involved (specifically the exhibitors and distributors) has revealed a great deal of the number of compromises that go on behind the scenes in the motion picture industry.</p>
