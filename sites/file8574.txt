								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Reading and writing are essential to everyday living. If you knew that just sitting down and reading a book would help with over coming things like stress or decreasing your chances of having Alzheimer’s disease, would you do it then? According to scientists, reading helps strengthen your brain and increase the blood flow which is beneficial. But if you’re able to sit down and read something that you are interested in then why not just read? If you are stressed out, read. Getting older or contracting Alzheimer’s disease could be helped just by picking up a book or reading the news paper. Its not proven that it will cure those things, but if it helps why no try it. Many people say they don&#8217;t have the time to read or they just don&#8217;t like to read, but why not just try it for twenty minuets; it is a way to escape the world for a little bit and learn new things. Hanski seems to think that reading is what shapes us. He also thinks it helps us with understanding our feelings, figuring out who we are and opening us up to all new things.</p>
<p>School is something that we all do not get excited about, but our teachers give us massive reading assessments that is helping us in the long run; however, the readings they give us are usually the cause of our stress. So maybe taking a step back from that reading assignment and clearing are minds and then getting back to it will help. No matter what, we have to read it but it makes a difference what attitude that you have towards the reading. If it is something you don&#8217;t want to do, then you are not going to be interested and get stressed out but if you look at it in a positive way then it might not be as bad. We go to school so that we can get a good education and get a good job to live a happy life well, to do all that we need to know how to read and write. So when looking at homework or a book that we don&#8217;t want to read, we are helping our brains out and making them stronger so that we can live out the lives that we all think about living.</p>
<p>Hanski wrote about one issue in his article and that was if you can’t read you are not going to fit in to a social environment. Everyone needs to read; You might not be the best reader out there but you still need to be able to read so you can complete everyday tasks. But reading could easily help you be successful in life. Mostly any job you get you will need to be able to read and write. Reading and writing is not only important for a job but also in who you become. “It helps us understand all feelings and events, it makes us better, it teaches us to respect people, it broadens our minds, and it opens out hearts to everything new.” (Mike Hanski, page 3) Hanski’s article makes you realize that reading is truly important and essential to our life. Without reading and writing we all might not be the bright people that we are today.</p>
