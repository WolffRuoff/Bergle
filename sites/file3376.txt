					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;This is an interesting issue, since it deals with Google global expansion - Here you&#039;re really referring to the battle for control of the distributor power role in China.  This is not necessarily a technology issue, but instead a strategic one to see where web users will direct their search traffic, and which technology companies (that manufacture smartphones and computers in China) will make partnerships with Google to make it the default search engine.  The posts you have written this semester suggest that companies like Google are scrambling to try to expand into as many power roles and international markets as possible - You might think about what this could mean for the future of the Internet and for users of the Internet if Google is able to expand its already dominant position in the world of Web searching.&lt;/p&gt;

				Comment on Google to Increase Producer Role by Dr. Sullivan				</title>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Great article and analysis here.  As Google becomes less of an online search company and more of a traditional media company, it is looking for ways in which is can control the content that web users are looking for, just like traditional media conglomerates are held together by their movie studio and production divisions. This is what the purchase of YouTube was all about, and this seems to be an even greater expansion of that producer-creator merge here.  Good job wrestling with all of the complicated power roles here!  As you can tell, the power roles become much more murky when you&#039;re dealing with online media as opposed to traditional media outlets.&lt;/p&gt;

				Comment on Groupon: The (Digital) Coupon by Dr. Sullivan				</title>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Sites like Groupon are really fascinating in the Internet industry, because much of their content relies on the crowdsourced content provided by online users (the paragon of this is, of course, YouTube).  In this sense, the websites act simply as distributors of user-generated content (placing the user in the role of creator!  Though, of course, without the power that creators typically have).  The exhibitors would be the ISPs that provide user access to the Internet - So, in this case, it would be companies like Comcast, etc that sell access to the Internet for a monthly fee.  Hope this clears up some of the power roles confusion!&lt;/p&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Great article that is highly relevant here, Group 5.  The burst of interest in new advertising models for social media and other forms of online media is something that is seems to be driving this industry.  It&#039;s interesting, too, that much of the buzz centers not around traditional websites, per se, but instead on discrete online environments (smartphone apps, Facebook apps, Twitter apps and uses, etc) that have become the springboards for targeting consumers with sales pitches.  The fact that Apple and Google have so much data about each and every user, for instance, also makes this a ripe opportunity for very specific, target marketing.  Thanks for the interesting article!&lt;/p&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Great article and, yes, very scary indeed!  It&#039;s easy to see why critics like Robert McChesney are so disturbed by the hyper-commercialization of broadcast television today.  With dwindling audience attention, these lines between creative and news content and the advertising will continue to blur, creating some very jarring realities for the viewers.  How can you really enjoy your favorite TV show if it is constantly trying to sell you something?  My suspicion is that more viewers will begin deserting the networks, which will make this problem even more acute.  It may help the networks to survive financially, but at what cost to innovation and creativity?  Thanks for the interesting article, Group 4!&lt;/p&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Reality TV is tailor made for these kinds of producer-client partnerships, it seems.  Programs like MTV&#039;s The Hills and even American Idol all have introduced sponsorship within the program itself, leaving viewers with nowhere to hide if they wish to skip the advertising.  It&#039;s also a plus that this kind of programming is so cheap to produce, which boosts its profit margin even higher through this kind of advertising.  Thanks for the interesting article!&lt;/p&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Streaming video is definitely a distribution technology that looks like it is going to potentially disrupt the status quo for the television industry.  In this case, smaller distributors like DishTV are battling with the larger media conglomerates (which themselves are producer/distributor/exhibitors of traditional media, so they hold a lot of power).  Because of copyrights, the traditional media firms have the upper hand in this looming battle, but it does look to be like an interesting one in the near future.  Good job here.&lt;/p&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Great one again, Group 4 - The syndication market can be a very profitably distribution strategy for reruns of major network programs.  Indeed, if you look back to the 90s and the attempt by Time-Warner to start their own television network (the WB, if anyone remembers!), their feature selling point was rerun of the hit TV show &quot;Friends&quot; which they owned because they were the producer of the program (NBC was simply the distributor).  The Friends example shows the limits of this strategy, though - while the ratings for the Friends reruns were strong on The WB, the other shows they programmed did not as a rule catch fire with viewers.  Perhaps Glee&#039;s cross-promotion and linking pins will make it a better bet for future profitability.  Good article and analysis here.&lt;/p&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Great article and analysis, Group 4.  I like the notion that the advertisers are attempting to clean up their act with regard to child advertising, if only (as you suggest) to ward of stronger regulation from the FCC and Congress.  This is the jawboning effect at work here.&lt;/p&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Ok, I admit it, I laughed out loud when I first read your blog post a couple of weeks ago.  The title was what got me.....!  And who is the dude with the sign???  Anyway, great example here of the power of reviewers (again, facilitator power role) to either help or to hurt the box office revenue for a film.  Even with a small but dedicated audience, films like this are going to be kryptonite for studios because the motion picture industry does not have the kind of target marketing market model of, say, the magazine, or cable television industry.  In short, without a big box office draw, the success of projects like this will be quite limited.  Nice job with your really compelling and eclectic selection of articles during the second half of the semester, Group 3!&lt;/p&gt;
