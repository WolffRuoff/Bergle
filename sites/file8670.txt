								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Facebook is a social media website used by over 500 million different people. It connects the world and brings people closer together but pushes people further apart at the same time.</p>
<p>Do you ever get jealous of that kid with that really cool house? Or that girl who has it all, nice clothes, shoes and jewelry? Imagine that jealousy and multiply it by thirty. Doesn’t feel too good does it? Kids on Facebook today are envious and some very unhappy due to the exposure of positive, yet misrepresented highlights from their peers. The reason I say multiply your jealousy by thirty is because online the jealousy is everywhere, there’s no getting around it, there’s no way out. Three hundred and forty eight. That is the average number of friends each Facebook user has. That is three hundred and forty eight people who display on Facebook only the positive aspects of their lives while keeping the negative out of reach of the internet and hidden within themselves. The distorted view Facebook users’ get of their friends has them logging off at night doubting themselves and not appreciating everything in their lives. This creates a sort of envy firing up in the stomachs of Facebooks many users. And while this type of envy not only has Facebook users drooling over what others have that they don’t have, it has profound effects on other aspects of life as well. The dangers of Facebook may even come from within the users themselves as the article states, “Facebook can lead to severe depression, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-hatred">self-loathing</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rage_(emotion)">rage</a> and hatred, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resentment">resentment</a>, feelings of inferiority and insecurity, pessimism, suicidal tendencies and desires, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_isolation">social isolation</a>, and other issues that can prove very serious” (Wikipedia, 2015). The problems quoted above are all very real. Depression, personal resentment, insecurities and suicidal tendencies are no joke. For the social networking site that supposedly better connects the world it certainly connects these mental health issues first hand to its users. Facebook needs to take immediate action with regards to fixing its web of endless jealousy. What appears to be a harmless photo of somebody’s vacation to the Bahamas or the new car a friend got for their birthday can turn into much worse. These photos mislead Facebook users into thinking negatively about themselves, harming their physical and mental state of being.  It has been generated from studies over the conflict of Facebook envy that at least 1 and 3 users leave the site feeling less satisfied with their lives (Wikipedia, 2015).  Facebook needs to act and act fast on this issue, because if Facebook wishes to expand even further, that entails bringing Facebook envy to the next level. And I strongly believe young Facebook users have been through enough already.</p>
