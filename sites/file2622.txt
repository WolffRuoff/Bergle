					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Nice catch here, Group 3 - What you didn&#039;t necessarily discuss but which is critical here is the role of the motion picture ratings board: a powerful facilitator in the movie industry.  A simple shift from R to PG-13 could mean major revenue for a studio, and as your example plainly illustrates, it can have recursive impacts on the production of the film itself (down to creative decisions about how the script and plot should look!).  If you haven&#039;t seen the film &quot;This Film Is Not Yet Rated&quot;, you definitely should, since it shines a bright light on this little seen but critical aspect of the industry (e.g., the ratings board).  Nice job.&lt;/p&gt;
