								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>These past few weeks have consisted of rehearsals 6 days a week that go until almost midnight, going back to our suites and staying up until later, and waking up way into the afternoon. The first week or so was focused on doing last minute interviews and finishing up transcriptions so we could start to build our script. We then had to shorten said script by more than half in order to have a 35 minute show (the phrase “kill your darlings” was used a lot). Around the second week, Troy invited us over to his house for dinner and swimming, which was honestly the highlight or my SDP experience.</p>
<p>When we’re not working on SDP, most of us can usually be found relaxing with a Netflix show or eating &#8211; I found that the amount of cheese I can eat on my own is terrifying. Some of us also went to the farmers market, walked in parks, thrift shopping, and last night we dyed my hair purple (and attempted to dye Jordan’s beard). But now it’s time to get our lines and blocking memorized as well as start thinking about what we’ll be wearing for the show, so stay tuned!!</p>
