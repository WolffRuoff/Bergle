					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Awesome post! I was bored of listening to the same mainstream music over and over again. One of my friends told me about Soundcloud and I first visited it last year. The site is great for discovering new music. I would also agree that it&#039;s great from an entrepreneurial standpoint. As you stated, Soundcloud&#039;s connections with Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr, and Google Plus provide musicians, aspiring to be stars, with plenty of opportunities to make themselves known. SoundCloud is definitely a great site for both musicians and listeners.&lt;/p&gt;
