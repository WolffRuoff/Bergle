								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Through my research, I have found that the Maximum Power, Darwin, Lotka, Energy Law, and Fourth Energy Law, found within chapter 3 of “Environment, Power, and Society”, by Howard T. Odum, can be used as a theory backing a recent innovation created by the company Sunatics for a solar charger which is a solution for limiting the amount of carbon dioxide within our air that affects our bodies, resulting in damaged blood vessels. This problem is also the controlling problem within the peer reviewed article “The Effects of Pollution”, which is a study done by the University of Toronto and published by American Fitness. The study conducted by University of Toronto, “The Effects of Pollution”, examined 25 healthy humans inhaling elevated concentrations of fine particles and ozone for two hours. After exposure, the volunteers’ blood vessels constricted between 2% and 4% on average (American Fitness). One can only imagine the toll that air pollution has taken on the millions of people around the world. This is disturbing because we as an intellectual society have found numerous ways to limit the amount of air pollution, yet we still haven’t utilized them efficiently. Interestingly enough, one of the many truths towards how we can limit our air pollution can be found in the studies of some of the greatest minds throughout history. In the 19<sup>th</sup> century Darwin popularized the concept of natural selection, and then during the early 20<sup>th</sup> century Lotka indicated that the maximization of power for useful purposes was the criterion for natural selection (Odum). Combining their two laws we find a central ideology that the species that uses the power found within the resources given to them will live the longest and maintain dominance within the idea of Natural Selection. Later Odum states “Systems that prevail are those with loading adjusted to operate at the peak of power efficiency”. What I find most interesting about this idea is how Odum uses the word “Systems”. A system is a set of things working together as parts of a mechanism or an interconnecting network. If humans are an interconnected network, then why aren’t we using all of our given resources in order to lower the amount of air pollution within our society? Our society has created more thane enough innovations to reduce air pollution, for example Sunatics new portable battery changer. “Our solar chargers require no batteries to operate, it’s important to have a portable solar charger that does not use batteries”, this limits the amount of energy used creating a society that will work as a system, cleaning our air all over the earth. Air pollution affects all life. Although humans are often depicted as selfish beings, we need clean air in order to maintain stability within our lives and a healthy lifestyle. The effects of air pollution are way more rapid and life changing then we could ever even imagine. The longer we choose to sit around and not use the available resources within our society in order to improve the qualities of our health, the more we are killing one another. The University of Toronto found that the constriction caused by air pollution could conceivably trigger cardiac events in individuals who have or are at risk for heart disease. I agree with the argument being placed by this university because if the most well respected minds within the science world understand the idea that the earth is a system within itself and has the proper tools to act as a proper system but the living organisms within it must abide by its rules and use its resources, then this problem of air pollution is solvable. The earth was created with the resources in order to fix the problems that its species create. Ultimately it comes down to whether we care enough about our health to act and make a difference in this world or to sit around and let our earth wither away.</p>
