								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span lang="EN-US">When we talk about the 21 century, people will say: “oh, it’s an electronic information age.” and this fact is obviously. Nowadays, it’s very normal to see a 4-year-old child and a grandpa use IPAD to play “the angry bird”. But as a part of this electronic age, do we own something? Or in the other word, do we own our domains? “When it comes to all our digital data, the answer to the question “what you own” is probably “not much”. You do not own your Amazon Kindle books; you’ve purchased a license to access the content. Your heir will not inherit your digital reading library. You do not own the music you stream……” (Watters, 2016) Maybe someone will say we can print the images we posted in our Facebook. But who will actually do these things—print our self-portraits so that we can save them and pass to our heirs. Actually, few people will go back and see what they posted in the past.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">If we don’t have the domain of our own, who have? The company likes Google? Just like the example given by Jim Groom in discussion, though it’s free to everyone to use the Gmail, we actually pay it by the given of our personal information. Or the government, or none, or, from another perceptive, everyone can own your domains! We all know everything we posted in the net can be seen by public and everyone can own our images. What’s worse is that even we posted nothing in the Facebook, people may also own our images because our relatives or friends posted them in their Facebook. So we can easily image that, with the further development of science and technology, in the future, everyone can know everything about others including the kind of pens they use, the clothes they wear, and even the money they </span><span lang="EN-US">have</span><span lang="EN-US">…… Seems like the video “Scary Pizza” we watched in class discussion. Although the situation show in the video will not happen today, we should reflect on our own. Do I use the internet in a safety way, or what we can do to protect ourselves in a more and more complex network environment?</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How much do we own of what we post online? The photos that I post online are mine, but they can be anyone&#8217;s. Someone can easily screenshot my photo and then they also &#8220;own&#8221; that photo. I have privacy settings so that only my followers that I approve can see my photos but some people are public which means anyone can see their posts. That makes it easier for others that they do not know to then &#8220;own&#8221; their photos. These photos are not tangible. I do not have them printed out I only have them online so if something happens to my accounts or my laptop, I no longer have those photos.</p>
<p>On social media, teenagers take how many likes they get on a photo very seriously. Now a day it is also a big deal how many comments one gets. The commenting on photos is for your friends, but also in a way for yourself to cement that relationship to others. Getting a lot of likes and comments on a photo usually shows that someone is good looking and popular. But that does not mean that someone that does not get as many likes is not popular and good looking. There are other factors that go into getting a lot of likes. For example someone with one thousand followers will get more likes than someone with five hundred followers because more people are exposed to their photo. A lot of thought is put in to posting a photo on Instagram (especially with girls). Then there is a lot less thought put into what photos are posted on Facebook because the likes and comments are not nearly as valued. It is more of an online photo album for themselves and their friends.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">           Jim Groom lead an intriguing discussion about who controls what you do and what you put online. He played a video in which a person ordering pizza was shocked to learn the pizza place had access to a lot of personal information like his social security number and his health records. Although this was uploaded years ago to predict the future, it is a pretty accurate representation of how easily anyone can find your personal information online. Just this past weekend I ordered a pizza for my friends and I. In the middle of the conversation, the pizza employee said, “this is abigail right?” He then proceeded to repeat my location to make sure he was delivering to the correct place. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">           Looks of shock and disgust filled the classroom as we continued to talk about how easy it is for perfect strangers to know very personal life details. Although many parents try to come up with extremely unique names in order to have their kid stand out in life, it may be backfiring on the internet. Jim Groom mentioned that someone with a very typical or average name like John Smith remains anonymous. There are so many people that pop up when you google search that name that there is no differentiating. In the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Domain of One’s Own in a Post</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, Watter’s states, [it is important] “</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> having the space and safety and security”  (2016). However, because of the our lack of controlled ownership, anything we post online is owned by private companies. Therefore it is easily accessible for anyone to see our personal information. Our lack of knowledge and ignorance about this allows us to fall victim to these online companies that control blogs and social media. Becoming educated on this topic, has helped me become aware of how little I control and I will definitely be taking more precautions in the future about how much information I give out. </span><span style="font-weight: 400"> Despite the fact that we are considered digital natives, most of us lack the knowledge to make informed decisions regarding the internet and how we use it. </span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ownership. As Watters highlights in her article we have moved further away from ownership. We have little control of what we own and control, especially in an increasingly online and digital world.</p>
<p>This post will challenge you in 3 ways:</p>
<p>Respond to this question: How can something like &#8216;Domain of One&#8217;s Own&#8217; aid students in taking ownership of one&#8217;s own writing and developing one&#8217;s writing process?</p>
<p>Respond to this question: Students take classes. Faculty frame what will be learned in those classes. How does one ultimately take ownership of one&#8217;s own learning and education?</p>
<p>Generate your own questions: based on the reading(s) and online discussions, generate your own questions and respond to each others&#8217; questions as appropriate.</p>
<p>You do not need to respond to each and every question presented above or through the comments from the class, but respond to the questions that have meaning to you, or that will help deepen your understanding of the reading/topic, or where you have insight you want to share about ownership, digital identity, a domain of one&#8217;s own, etc. Do not just answer questions for the sake of answering questions, but to engage more deeply in this online discussion.</p>
