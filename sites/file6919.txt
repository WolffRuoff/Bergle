								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Autism Spectrum Disorder is a developmental disability that affects many children as young as two or three years old. Some of the characteristic hallmarks of autism are difficulties with social interactions, language and cognitive delays or difficulties, and restricted, repetitive, and stereotyped behaviors. Every person with autism has a different experience and autism is often described as a wide spectrum. The spectrum is labeled from low functioning to high functioning. People with “low functioning” autism are usually described as having more severe symptoms while people with “high functioning” autism are described as having less severe symptoms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There are many issues with the way we label autism and the way we classify and categorize people with autism. Although the concept of a spectrum is helpful in understanding autism, oftentimes people with autism do not fit neatly onto the spectrum and this may be extremely frustrating for them. There are a multitude of symptoms and differing severity of each symptom that create a different combination for each person who is diagnosed with autism. It is almost as if there is a spectrum for each symptom and each person with autism fits onto each spectrum in their own way. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I believe thinking of autism in this way makes it much easier for people to try and understand what having autism is truly like. Of course, people without the disorder will never fully understand what it is like for people with it. That being said, it is important for the general population to try their best to be informed and accommodating in order to have a fuller understanding of what people with autism experience. </span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Autism Spectrum Disorder</span></p>
<p>This week in class, we focused on Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). In 2013 the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) released it&#8217;s 5th edition (DSM-5).  In the DSM-5 they labeled ASD as the umbrella term that is used to diagnose a series of developmental disorders. A developmental disorder is a disorder that manifests challenges in nonverbal communication, speech, and social interaction In addition to relabeling ASD they revised which disorders fall under the spectrum. However, many psychologists argue if the classifications in the DSM-5 were correct. Especially when it involves Asperger&#8217;s Syndrome.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What is Asperger&#8217;s Syndrome?</span></p>
<p>Asperger&#8217;s Syndrome, also synonymous with High-Functioning Autism, is a developmental disorder that is primarily characterized by difficulty in social interactions; this includes challenges with understanding emotions, the &#8220;give and take&#8221; of conversation, and nonverbal communication (i.e. speaking from a distance, tone,  and volume). The challenges with social interactions are right in line with Autism. However, according to the previous DSM system, with Asperger&#8217;s there is no significant language or cognitive delay when it comes to Asperger&#8217;s. In fact people with Asperger&#8217;s tend to have remarkable focus, pay great attention to detail, and may excel in fields such as engineering, accounting, and mathematics to name a few.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The debate</span></p>
<p>When the DSM-5 was released in 2013 many psychologists were shocked to learn that Asperger&#8217;s Syndrome was being characterized under ASD. Primarily that Asperger&#8217;s misses a crucial criteria of there not being a significant delay in speech. Plus, Asperger&#8217;s is noticed a lot later compared to Autism because it&#8217;s challenges in social situations not speech. Many psychologists argue that Asperger&#8217;s should still have it&#8217;s on classification in the DSM-5 because it is not a social anxiety disorder, but it also doesn&#8217;t quite meet the qualifications to be Autism.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">So what is it?</span></p>
<p>Is it a disability, is it a disorder, or is it just a difference?</p>
<p>A 2002 article by Simon Baron-Cohen attempted to answer this question. According to Baron-Cohen The it depends on which model you want to use to look at it. Psychologists can approach Asperger&#8217;s from the systemizing-empathizing model. In this it looks at the systemize and empathy aspects of Asperger&#8217;s and how that translates to our society. If you look at it from the systemizing portion (where a person&#8217;s strength is understanding &#8216;things&#8217;); Asperger&#8217;s leans more toward that of a disability because our society strives on the idea that people are to be social. People with Asperger&#8217;s tend to shy away from social interactions due to not being able to understanding certain cues. However, if we look at it from the empathy angle (&#8216;understanding people&#8217;), we can understand that people with Asperger&#8217;s have trouble understanding reading people; which can be difficult for anyone, but it is no need for alarm. Mainly because the only reason people with Asperger&#8217;s are seem as &#8216;abnormal&#8221; is because of they have a deficit in the empathizing dimension. Even so people with Asperger&#8217;s can still function and flourish in society. All it takes is being put into the right environment.</p>
<p>Sadly, for treatment and insurance purposes you would need to classify it as a disability or disorder.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Why is it important?</span></p>
<p>This debate is important because it shows us what improvements can be made to ending the stigma surrounding not only Asperger&#8217;s but ASD. We focus so heavily on this need to classify people into categories of &#8216;normal&#8217; and &#8216;abnormal&#8217;, all while forgetting that these are people we&#8217;re referring to. It is ironic that this field is one of the main causes in the growth of stigma, because to provide treatment we need to provide the answer. Yes, it could also technically be the fault of insurance companies needing a diagnosis in order to treat, but that doesn&#8217;t mean it is right. From here we need to look at ways at classifying without creating more harm to people.</p>
<p>Personally, this topic is close to my heart as someone close to me has Asperger&#8217;s. Yes they exhibit most of the signs: misunderstanding social cues, trouble with nonverbal communication (especially distance), but they excel in mathematics and computer engineering. Had it not been made known that this person has Asperger&#8217;s you would never have known because he functions just like you and me, holds conversations (sometimes too many), and goes about his own business. At most you maybe would have thought he was a little awkward in social situations. As this is something I encounter frequently I understand how easy it is to take the challenges at face value and place it on the disorder. By doing so we minimize the person.;which just adds to the stereotype and stigma.</p>
<p>In conclusion the take away from this is that as a society we need to remember that <strong>people are not defined by their disorders.</strong></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>All students are now well into their service learning placements and they are very excited about their experiences. After each visit, students submit “reflective” journals in which they share their observations and raise questions about what they have experienced. At least once a week, we have a “check in” discussion during class, where students talk with each other about what they are seeing in their placements. This is an opportunity for students to share significant observations and help each other make sense of those observations. One of the things I believe is most valuable about these discussions is that they provide a chance for students to question some of their initial assumptions and reactions to what they experienced. For instance, students who go to the same placement on different days may come to very different conclusions about a given child or his/her behavior. When this happens, we are able to explore and dismantle some simplistic assumptions about why the child behaved that way (e.g., maybe he isn’t just an oppositional child by nature).</p>
<p>Over the past few weeks, we have finished discussion of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs). Specifically, we examined core characteristics of Autism and Asperger’s syndrome. Students discussed some recent eye-tracking research on the nature of social information processing in autism. This research may provide insight into the difficulties children with autism often having in reading social cues. They also examined the recent changes in the DSM classification of ASDs. We also recently began to discuss issues of child maltreatment.</p>
<p><strong>Coming up…</strong></p>
<p>In the next week or two, we will be learning about ADHD and disruptive behavior disorders. We will examine changes in the diagnostic criteria for ADHD and will critically examine pubic perceptions of “overdiagnosis”. We will also approaches to the treatment of ADHD.</p>
<p>**Finally, over the course of the next 2 or 3 visits, students should approach you with ideas for a service project. This is a major component of their service learning experience and requires that the students consult with their site supervisors.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><u>The Importance of Neurodiversity</u></p>
<p>Neurodiversity is an ideal perspective when working with children who appear to have certain differences and should be crucial for educators to consider. In class, we discuss the discrimination between a difference and a deficit. Most children with Autism, ADHD, or other disorders that impact their performance in a classroom, are viewed as having deficits. The negative connotations that come along with this word not only imply a lack of understanding, but they also breed peer rejection, lowered self-esteem, and impact the efficiency of the child’s learning in the classroom. Neurodiversity, however, is a perspective that promotes difference among children and the ways in which they learn. By using the term difference instead, we imply that the child’s disorder is not something to be fixed or seen as abnormal, but instead accept the differences in the various ways children learn and interact with their peers. So, for example, if a child struggles with social withdrawal, it won’t be seen as a problem but instead can be used to individualize the student’s learning. This particular child may work better on personal, precise tasks rather than activities where tasks are divided and shared by various group members. In today’s society, as we work towards a more accepting world, neurodiversity is actually becoming more widely considered. In class, we discussed various careers that would suit our own strengths and weaknesses. Whether you are diagnosed with some sort of intellectual disorder or not, everyone has their own weaknesses and positive qualities that would make them a better fit for certain jobs.  This idea of finding the ideal working style and atmosphere for the individual is called niche construction, which is a concept discussed alongside neurodiversity. This construction stems from the idea that every individual diagnosed with a disorder actually needs to find an environment in which they can thrive. For example, a person with lower functioning autism may thrive while completing individual financial work in a cubicle but may struggle working as a salesman at a car dealership. Niche construction is all about finding outlets and atmospheres which allow the individual to use their own personal strengths in order to be successful. This same idea can also be applied in a classroom setting, however sometimes it can be more difficult because teachers must work with multiple children at a time. As a whole, our society can work on accepting and using some of these concepts in order to give children and individuals with these disorders appropriate opportunity to succeed.</p>
