								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So here I am! The same spot I was in just 5 months ago, but this time I feel like a different person. As second semester starts, I can feel the confidence and excitement pulse through my veins. When I began classes at the beginning of last semester, I had no idea what to expect.</p>
<p>How would the classes be?<br />
Could I handle the academics?<br />
Would I be able to succeed?<br />
And, would I be happy?</p>
<p>These were important questions that used to linger in my mind, though now I have resounding answers to each of them. Last semester I figured out what I needed to do to accomplish my goals. This semester will be about reapplying those skills to build on the progress I have made thus far.</p>
<p>After concluding the first week of classes, I couldn&#8217;t be happier with the diversity and cool factor of each class. I am taking Politics of the Middle East, Microeconomics, Principles of Journalism, and a religion class called Meaning of Life. Muhlenberg has made me excited about learning. Taking notes and asking questions is a treat, not a burden. As I embark on part 2 of 8 in this journey, I look forward to sharing my perspective at least once a week!</p>
<p>Until next time,<br />
Jake</p>
