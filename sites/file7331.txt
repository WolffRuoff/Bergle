								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are constantly being watched on the internet. There is no privacy, no matter how tight we think the security on our social media pages are. The notion of social media sites being ‘free,’ is a scam, because although they may not take our money, they take our privacy. These sites, such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Gmail all advertise the fact that users can sign up and use their services for no cost; that ‘cost’ meaning money. The real cost of using these free sites is that they have access to view everything we do while using their product. These services will track what we search, and use it as a way to advertise products to us, knowing that we will be interested in the advertisements because of our internet search history. For example, if I were to purchase clothes online, the items that I view online would appear as advertisements on my Facebook news feed; I do not think that is such a coincidence. Jim Groom helped dissect the messages that we see every day in media. He explained the concept of DOOM (Domain of One’s Own), and shared that although we may be in charge of our individual social media pages, there are other people who own our domain as well.</p>
<p>In George Orwell’s <em>1984</em>, the story focuses on the idea that ‘Big Brother’ is always watching and listening to every small detail of every person’s life. That idea was thought to be crazy, before Edward Snowden released thousands of documents revealing that the government was tracking every small detail of every person’s life, just as ‘Big Brother’ had done in <em>1984</em>. As scary of a thought it is to think that the government and sites such as Google and Facebook know almost everything about us, the truth is, we bring it upon ourselves. When we sign up for media sites, we tend to enter a lot of personal information. It is frightening, but all of our personal information is on the internet, whether we like it or not. We have essentially given ‘Big Brother’ every small detail about our lives just through social media. Pun intended, we are all DOOMed.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After Google-searching my full name, I discovered that I share a name with a very well known and successful neurologist at UCLA. This M.D. Sarah Kremen works at an Alzheimer&#8217;s Disease Research Center, which I find to be interesting because my grandpa Kremen has Alzheimer&#8217;s. This Sarah Kremen consumed the majority of the top results, and I didn&#8217;t find any results of myself until the second page. The second page contains both my Facebook profile and my Youtube channel. The third page contains my one video on Vimeo, one Vine that I revined, and pictures of me on my dance studio&#8217;s Pinterest. After the third page, I can&#8217;t find anymore information on me. When I click on &#8216;images&#8217;, the top photos of me that come up are my profile photos of different websites/apps and my Pinterest photos. When I click on &#8216;videos&#8217;, all of my dance teacher&#8217;s dance videos from Youtube come up because she tagged my name in the description of the videos that I am in. If someone who doesn&#8217;t know me was to search my name in the internet, they would most likely come to the conclusion that I am a passionate dancer because the majority of the photos and videos of me are dance related.</p>
<p>This digital activity made me feel reassured that there is nothing too personal or too private in the internet of myself that I wouldn&#8217;t want the public to see. When I am older and job authorities are searching my name, I am confident that they won&#8217;t find anything that would prevent me from getting that job.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I got a Facebook when I was 12, I was ecstatic because it was my first time using social media. I didn&#8217;t create an account to truly expose my identity, however. I just sought to communicate with my friends and acquaintances. In 7th grade, there was a trend with the girls in my school to change your last name on Facebook to the last name of your favorite male singer. Pretty soon I was no longer Sarah Kremen; I was Sarah Bublé, a 13-year-old with a Michael Bublé obsession. It was also a trend to be &#8220;in a relationship&#8221; with one of your best friends to make it seem like you weren&#8217;t single. To this day, I am still &#8220;married&#8221; to my best friend Naomi. It&#8217;s been so for 5 years.</p>
<p>It turns out, this trend wasn&#8217;t just a trend for teenagers at South Side Middle School. In <em>It&#8217;s Complicated : The Social Lives of Networked Teens </em>by Danah Boyd, social media is a toss-up because while some teens feel the need to take it seriously and make their profile as accurate as possible to depict who they truly are, others find &#8220;playful ways&#8221; to &#8220;respond to social media sites&#8217; requests for information&#8221; (Boyd 33). An example of a &#8220;playful way&#8221; according to the text is how teens like to make their best friends their &#8220;siblings&#8221; on Facebook to show how close they are. I can relate to this because on my Facebook it says I have 6 sisters, even though I only have 1.</p>
<p>Though it is funny to fabricate information on social media, doesn&#8217;t it defeat the purpose of social media? Now that I&#8217;m no longer 13, I depend on Facebook for providing accurate information about people when I go on their profiles. For example, after I came across my roommate&#8217;s profile for the first time, I assumed that everything she established about herself was true so I wouldn&#8217;t be &#8220;catfished&#8221; in essence. Nowadays, we are becoming more reliant on social media to learn about each other, which is concerning because it is so easy to create an inaccurate depiction of yourself.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">         The first chapter of It’s Complicated explains the difficulty of trying to create a persona on social media because everyone perceives things differently. This chapter discusses an example where a girl was tagged in a photo holding a beer on Facebook. Although she did not post the photo, friends were notified that she was tagged in it. To most people this picture creates a poor image of the girl ;however, it is just a photo and viewers are not clear of the context. She may have been holding the drink for a friend, but not enough information is given to understand what is happening. In chapter 1 boyd (2014) states, “ Without a shared sense of context, hanging out online becomes burdensome. “ (p. 36) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">            People are very quick to judge online and there is not much room for explanation. There is no way to know how a post can be perceived by everyone and therefore there is no way to insure that it is perceived correctly. One quick tweet or post on instagram and the rumor mills have started. One person screenshots the post and declares her opinion about the post and it is then spread like wildfire. People thrive on gossip and they read too much into posts that were supposed to be fun and lighthearted. This is the black hole of society. Everybody assumes without thinking. Everyone judges without questioning. These mistakes that we all make are much harder to make in person as you simply ask a question as the conversation flows.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">            There is no conversation on social media, only little bits and pieces that have no context or room for question and answer. How do we fix this? Boyd repetitively mentioned how social media is a challenge; a challenge to our identity and a challenge to our peers. Is this a challenge we should try to overcome or  should we take after </span><span style="font-weight: 400"> Brian O’Neill,  in the article </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Teens Who Say No To Social Media,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> who chose to talk in person with his friends and avoid social media all together.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">            Growing up my life did not revolve around technology. My parents were strict with my television use and I only used the computer for homework as we only had two desktops to share with all the siblings. It was extremely weird for me to go to my friends’ houses where there was no restriction on television use. However, my parents’ restriction on technology never seemed like a constraint. My mom was a stay at home mom so she was able to keep me occupied with constant activity. I distinctly remember my kindergarten schedule. I had afternoon kindergarten so I spent the morning cooking breakfast and going to classes for things like tennis or art. My mom and I would also indulge in watching The Price is Right once in awhile. Besides that show, I don&#8217;t remember watching many others. I did not notice how little television I watched until my best friend started talking about it one day. She was excitedly telling me about her favorite shows like Hannah Montana and Suite life of Zack and Cody. I just stood there nodding even though I had never heard of those shows before. That was the first time I felt out of the loop for not using constant technology. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">          It wasn&#8217;t until I received a phone in 6th grade that I started to really use technology. However, my phone had limited capabilities as I could only text and call. This was useful for chatting with friends and making plans but It wasn&#8217;t glued to my side like it is today. My real technology use did not start until 8th grade when I got my first smartphone and my very own laptop. This was also the time that my parents allowed me to get my first social media account, Facebook. I was ecstatic that I was able to get facebook because it  was the latest craze for middle schoolers. I remember my friends complaining that they had to be facebook friends with their parents so they could monitor their posts. I felt lucky because my mother did not have a facebook and my dad explicitly told me to not friend him because his account was for business only. Getting my first friend request was exhilarating because it gave me validation that people knew who I was and wanted to be facebook friends. Although many people say facebook has died out, I still use it to this day. I find it very useful to message someone if I don&#8217;t have their phone number and contact a large number of people through Facebook groups. In the article called Teens, Social Media &amp; Technology Overview 2015, Lenhart says “</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Facebook remains the most used social media site&#8230;with </span><span style="font-weight: 400">71% of all teens using the site</span><span style="font-weight: 400">.” (1998, p.1) Although people may not actively use facebook as much as other sites, I think that most people have an account to stay connected and I find myself in that category. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">                Despite the fact I did not use technology much as a young girl, it is now part of my everyday life. Growing up with many siblings, I saw the evolution of technology right from my own home. My brothers who are 6 years older, did not receive their first cell phone until 9th grade and their own laptops until college. My sister, who is four years older than me, received her first phone in 7th grade and got her own laptop in 10th grade. The pattern continues on to me and then finally to my little sister who received her first phone in 5th grade and her first laptop in 6th grade. My siblings and I were raised by the same people but we were given technology at different ages. At first I was upset that my little sister received all of these fancy gadgets at a younger age. However, I soon realized that it wasn&#8217;t my parents playing favorites but rather an attempt to to help her social standing with friends and academic standing in school. Through the evolution of my family, I was able to see how the progression of technology makes it more prevalent at younger ages. </span></p>
