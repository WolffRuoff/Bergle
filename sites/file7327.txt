								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is a fine line between fair use and copyright infringement, especially when it comes to YouTube content. According to Rich Stim, fair use is defined as “any copying of copyrighted material done for a limited and ‘transformative’ purpose, such as to comment upon, criticize, or parody a copyrighted work. Such uses can be done without permission from the copyright owner” (Stim, 2013). With traditional media, discerning what is fair use and what is not may be easier, but the problem has been exacerbated with the introduction of digital media.  On YouTube, “many uploaders do not [address copyright issues] and simply recycle and share copyrighted media with seeming impunity,” while many claim fair use and are still sued regardless (Collins, 2014). The system that YouTube uses to catch copyrighted material is called Content ID, and some claim it is too sensitive. Collins gives many examples of users who used copyrighted material, but claimed fair use in the video’s description, which Content ID does not detect. There are also people who are unaware of fair use and how it could work to their benefit, myself included. For one of my college applications, I needed to submit a dance portfolio via YouTube. One of my background songs got flagged for copyright and I had to find an alternate way to send in my application. I could have claimed fair use, but it would have been extremely difficult to get the video back on YouTube because of how strict these copyright rules can be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I feel that as long as credit is given in the video description, there should be no reason to flag content for copyright. It can be argued that copyright holders putting restrictions on YouTube users will limit creation online. Many artists use others’ work as a starting point for theirs, whether that means making a remix or a parody of the original work. If YouTube’s Content ID continues to be this strict less people will continue to upload to YouTube, possibly leading to a change in the digital space. The types of videos uploaded to YouTube may change and hopefully our online culture is not altered as a result.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After Google-searching my full name, I discovered that I share a name with a very well known and successful neurologist at UCLA. This M.D. Sarah Kremen works at an Alzheimer&#8217;s Disease Research Center, which I find to be interesting because my grandpa Kremen has Alzheimer&#8217;s. This Sarah Kremen consumed the majority of the top results, and I didn&#8217;t find any results of myself until the second page. The second page contains both my Facebook profile and my Youtube channel. The third page contains my one video on Vimeo, one Vine that I revined, and pictures of me on my dance studio&#8217;s Pinterest. After the third page, I can&#8217;t find anymore information on me. When I click on &#8216;images&#8217;, the top photos of me that come up are my profile photos of different websites/apps and my Pinterest photos. When I click on &#8216;videos&#8217;, all of my dance teacher&#8217;s dance videos from Youtube come up because she tagged my name in the description of the videos that I am in. If someone who doesn&#8217;t know me was to search my name in the internet, they would most likely come to the conclusion that I am a passionate dancer because the majority of the photos and videos of me are dance related.</p>
<p>This digital activity made me feel reassured that there is nothing too personal or too private in the internet of myself that I wouldn&#8217;t want the public to see. When I am older and job authorities are searching my name, I am confident that they won&#8217;t find anything that would prevent me from getting that job.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since technology has always been a part of my life, I have never stopped to reflect on the impact it has had on my life. Although I am not sure if the implications are positive or negative, I know I would not have the same interests today if technology wasn’t a player.</p>
<p>My earliest memories of technology are playing with my Leapster and reading from my LeapPad. The Leapster was an educational gaming system, on which I remember playing a dog game. The player would have to take care of the dogs by doing math problems. As a math major, I see that this could be where my love for math roots from. The LeapPad was a device that you could attach books to, and it would read them to you and have activities about the book at the end. I now understand why I liked my LeapPad so much—I am an auditory learner, and often listen to audiobooks.</p>
<p>Like many other children, I loved watching TV. My favorite show growing up was <i>Blues Clues</i>, where a dog named Blue would leave clues that would help solve a mystery by the end of the program. I enjoyed the variety of characters and the bright colors used to design them. I also loved to watch princess movies. I would go to the library to take out the VHS of <i>Belle’s Tales of Friendship</i>, watch it everyday, and return it by the three day deadline, just to take it out again the next day.</p>
<p>Years later, I got a phone after my sixth grade graduation, and I find this to be a pivotal point in my technological life since it was my first gateway to communication through technology. It was a Samsung Intensity, which had a slide-out keyboard. I thought having a phone like this would make me &#8220;cool&#8221; amongst my peers, since many of them already had phones. However, I found that the hype was much greater than the actual experience; I did not text people often nor did the phone have Internet capabilities. Yet I found that having a phone provided a false sense of comfort, which I still believe hold today.</p>
<p>It would be four years until I had an iPhone. I got the iPhone 5c (in blue) and I found that it changed my life it many different ways. I had Internet access on the family computer at home, but now i had the Internet in my pocket. My parents put restrictions on my phone, but I had still upgraded from my slide phone. I did not have any social media accounts until I turned 18, but I always watched YouTube. I have always been entertained by a variety of content creators, including comedians, vloggers (video bloggers), dancers, and gymnasts. Watching YouTube often has shifted my time management, and has probably affected my sleep patterns. However, I would never stop watching YouTube because this is where I find creative inspiration.</p>
<p>When I turned 18, I finally logged onto Facebook and Instagram, with intentions of using it to find Muhlenberg students. As expected, it has become much more than that. Now in college, I find that Facebook is one of the best ways to connect with my friends &amp; family. I make sure to also post lots of pictures so others can feel the same sense of connection.</p>
<p>My parents gifted me with a MacBook for college, and I mainly use it to read online articles for coursework and type on the Pages application. Another tool I use is Wolfram Alpha, which is a scholarly form of Google. According to our Technology Survey, I am the only person that answered that I use it (Hertel, 2016). I love Wolfram Alpha, and it is especially useful for math, because sometimes it is hard to get math help on Google. I can imagine that there are apps or websites that I am aware of that are just as useful as Wolfram Alpha that I can someday bring into my technological tool belt.</p>
