(March 22, 2011). P&amp;G, Best Buy, Google, EA, Twitter Headline Ad Age&#8217;s Digital Conference April 6-7. Retrieved March 25, 2011 from <a href="http://adage.com/article/digital/p-g-google-ea-headline-ad-age-digital-conference-april-6-7/149513/">http://adage.com/article/digital/p-g-google-ea-headline-ad-age-digital-conference-april-6-7/149513/</a></p>
<p>On April 6th &amp; 7th, AdAge will facilitate the fifth annual Digital Conference, “where marketers, publishers, agency executives, digital strategists, creative technologists and Internet entrepreneurs will share their visions for the digital and emerging media landscape, along with their stories of what&#8217;s working and what&#8217;s not.” This year’s conference headlines the burgeoning relationship between the video-gaming industry, online social media services and mobile platforms.<br />
<span id="more-976"></span><br />
Social Media platforms have found many new and innovative ways to generate profits. Twitter’s Promoted Tweets platform that currently allow major advertisers to get their ‘160 Characters of Fame’ when their tweets show up on users twitter feeds.  At the conference, Twitter’s President of Global Revenues will show the monetization structure of the platform and discuss future paid advertising opportunities.</p>
<p>Another important up-and-coming industry that will be discussed at the conference is the new social shopping and group-buying companies like Groupon and Living Social. These companies act as distributors and exhibitors for either local or national companies to push out deals to consumers who can get discounts if their is a certain predetermined number of users who express interest opt in.</p>
<p>Consumer demand has shifted industry focus from a console-game model to a multi-platform model utilizing the Internet (with services such as Xbox Live and the PlayStation Network). The shift has developed new revenue sources while creating an experience driven by social interaction. Revenue models have expanded to include more transactions after the initial purchasing of the game, making the experience more engaging and longer lasting. The shift dilutes the distribution power of traditional game-consoles, as new platforms emerge as distribution channels for video-gaming.</p>
<p>Additionally, social platforms, especially Facebook, have seen great profits from the implementation of their gaming platform.  Games Like Mafia Wars, the Oregon Trail, and Farmville, have built up major followings, and only allow users a limited number of moves within a set time period, which can be extended if users are willing to pay, which surprisingly a great number of people are. Here, we see the shifting creator and producer power roles, as small application developers can create a prolific number of new applications at low cost, a parallel to the traditional economic boom/bust model in media industries.</p></div>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Calkins, T., &amp; Rucker, D. (2011, February 3). Will Social Media Slay the Super Bowl? Retrieved February 5, 2011, from <a href="http://adage.com/cmostrategy/article?article_id=148644">http://adage.com/cmostrategy/article?article_id=148644</a></p>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://realvision.ae/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/pepsi_superbowl_miniscreen_social_media-300x226.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="226" />Companies are spending less money advertising during the Super Bowl and putting more funding and efforts into social media marketing because some companies feel that social media is more useful in developing brand recognition. The key to brand recognition is what the authors refer to as engagement with the audience. They discuss the barriers to online engagement, such as pop-up blockers and users on Facebook and Twitter, who may follow or become fans of a company’s page, but not actively participate with the brand. The authors argue that Superbowl ads are still more effective at engaging audiences because they generate buzz.<br />
<span id="more-727"></span></p>
<blockquote><p>Many people watch the Super Bowl primarily for the advertising, which they then continue to talk about afterward. The ads are posted on YouTube and countless blogs; news outlets comment on them and people discuss them in the office the next day.</p></blockquote>
<p>Consumers are currently spending as much time on the Internet or their smart-phones as they do watching television, so advertisers must flock to where the the viewers are. Despite this, even the companies with the greatest social presences can fail to capture the attention of consumers. Changing times and technologies challenge companies to capture the buzz generated from Superbowl advertising and carry it into social media platforms. The most effective advertising integrates different forms of media to create synergistic engagement with consumers across multiple platforms and at every aspect of a consumer’s day. As consumers spend more time online, advertising dollars will shift to online advertising, to be where the consumer spends the most time.</p>
<p>If more companies go the path of Ford and Pepsi and choose to spend their advertising dollars online rather than paying for, at most, minutes during the Super Bowl, it could have a significant impact on the television industry, and putting money into television advertisements will be less cost effective. As a result of these trends the Internet advertising industry will increase in usage.</p>
<p>Advertising agencies, as the creators/producers, need to work harder to ensure that they engage the appropriate audiences through the right channels for their specific clients, especially due to the fast changes in technology. Additionally, social media platforms are becoming more powerful exhibitors in the advertising world.</p>
