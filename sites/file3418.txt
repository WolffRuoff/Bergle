Retrieved from <a href="http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/industry/legal-and-management/vice-president-joe-biden-calls-piracy-outright-1005136622.story">http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/industry/legal-and-management/vice-president-joe-biden-calls-piracy-outright-1005136622.story</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://images1.variety.com/graphics/photos/_storypics/biden_joe_piracy.jpg" alt="" width="175" height="117" />Stricter copyright laws may be looming, if comments by Vice President Joe Biden are any indication. In an <a href="http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/industry/legal-and-management/vice-president-joe-biden-calls-piracy-outright-1005136622.story">interview</a> with the Hollywood trade magazine <em><a href="http://www.variety.com/Home/">Variety</a></em>, he took a personal stand against piracy (both music and movies), calling it “outright theft.” Industry executives are hopeful that this strong language indicates that Washington is willing to push through new regulations on streaming and downloading despite other drastically more important issues that the White House and Congress should be tackling instead.</p>
<p><span id="more-1145"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to Billboard, Biden’s statements leave “little doubt about where the White House stands on piracy.” This is ridiculous, of course. One of the cardinal rules of politics is to leave a little bit of doubt about your position on everything to avoid those embarrassing “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read_my_lips:_no_new_taxes">read my lips, no new taxes</a>” moments. Biden does this, clumsily, by hinting that the entertainment industry isn’t devoting enough resources to educating the public about piracy. Recording industry executives, however, salivate every time someone in the authority role publicly takes their side. This is because industry people fully understand how important the authority power role is to their business.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s no secret that the recording industry spends more time suing consumers in court than actually producing decent music for those consumers to buy (or steal). And the industry’s success in the courtroom depends crucially on their lobbying success in Washington. Biden’s interview with <em>Variety</em> comes at a time when the White House is busy <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/ip_white_paper.pdf">drafting revisions to U.S. copyright law</a> that will strongly favor the recording industry. First on the block: unauthorized music streaming, the mainstay of facilitators like <a href="http://listen.grooveshark.com">Grooveshark</a>, which the new rules may officially prohibit for the first time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Producers within the recording industry have argued for stricter downloading and streaming rules for years. The industry’s main facilitator, the <a href="http://riaa.org/physicalpiracy.php">RIAA</a>, plasters its website with the <a href="http://riaa.org/physicalpiracy.php">scary numbers behind piracy</a>: $12.5 billion in lost revenue every year, $2.7 billion in lost worker earnings, and 71,060 lost jobs. The money the labels make from sucking their own “artists” dry through exploitative contracts may help lessen this impact, especially if they start passing some of their ill-gotten earnings from their major executives’ pockets to their “workers.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ironically, the ones really feeling the kick of illegal downloading are the exhibitors. The operators of Borders, Barnes and Noble, and Wal-Mart stores are the ones whose pockets you’re actually stealing from when you download <a href="http://rebeccablackonline.com/">Rebecca Black</a>’s new album from Pirate Bay instead of purchasing it. Whether or not the record companies will start sharing any new revenue generated from increased enforcement of copyright laws with artists and exhibitors remains to be seen, but it’s highly unlikely.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ultimately, the recording industry will probably pressure Washington into passing stricter copyright rules. The bulk of the politicians’ electorate—old people—couldn’t care less about music downloading laws, and the people most affected by it—Generation Y—are generally politically disengaged and/or powerless. In a time when arguments about funding for Social Security and international wars are threatening to shut down the government, a new copyright law is an easy pass, and this one will probably slip through Congress unnoticed. The impact it will have on each person’s individual music experience, however, is still uncertain.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bruno, A. (12 April 2011). New Grammy rules (finally) acknowledge videogame music. <em>Billboard</em>. Retrieved from <a href="http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/industry/digital-and-mobile/new-grammy-rules-finally-acknowledge-videogame-1005127322.story">http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/industry/digital-and-mobile/new-grammy-rules-finally-acknowledge-videogame-1005127322.story</a></p>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://echoesblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/grammy-logo-gold.jpg" alt="" width="140" height="178" />In a long-overdue decision, the <a href="http://www.grammy.org/recording-academy">Recording Academy</a> recently announced that it would consider video game music for <a href="http://www.grammy.com/">Grammy Awards</a>. Although video games won’t have their own category (yet), they’ll be included in a general category encompassing “Music for Visual Media.” Nobody in the general public cares about this, of course, but the interesting question is whether they should.</p>
<p><span id="more-1109"></span></p>
<p>It’s tempting to compare the Grammy Awards to MTV—sad stories of once-powerful facilitators that got an ear-boxing from cable and the Internet—but the power of the Grammy Awards to effectively promote music even during the network era is questionable. The event has always been a self-congratulatory party for an inside group of music industry people, and during a time when media choices were more limited, the public mainly just enjoyed basking in the pomp and circumstance of the networks’ glitzy coverage. In fact, a better analogy for the Grammys would be to an Independence Day parade, a once-family friendly event today attended mostly by old war vets as the younger crowd plugs into yet another interactive media platform.</p>
<p>The reality, however, is that the Grammy Awards aren&#8217;t really trying to facilitate interaction with that increasingly disinterested TV-viewing public. It’s aimed at those industry insiders, and that’s what makes the inclusion of video game music into the award categories so important. The Recording Academy may not have much direct power over audiences, but by facilitating interactions between industry creators and producers, it helps to determine what those audiences eventually hear online, in stores, and on the radio. Now it may help to determine what video gamers, probably the least likely subgroup of Americans to care about the Grammys, hear when they log into <em><a href="http://us.battle.net/wow/en/">World of Warcraft</a></em>.</p>
<p>The new rules formalize linking pin activities between the record companies and the video game industry that have been growing with the video game industry itself. Popular titles like <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> routinely license popular rock and heavy-metal songs that fit well within their violent and iconoclastic gaming environment. Now, as new game consoles like Wii <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/tech/gaming/2007-05-24-wii_N.htm">offer games for a wide variety of audience categories</a>—fitness games for kids and older adults, chess games for math prodigies—that expand video games far beyond their traditional teenage-male cult, the record companies are starting to work with the gaming companies to exploit all the new distribution and exhibition possibilities.</p>
<p>Why wouldn’t Sony, for example, create music just for a new video game aimed at a particular age group or gender? These days, online and console games probably have a larger audience than MTV or VH1, and they have the ability to reach at least as specialized an audience as a cable television network. Cross-platform releases that include video games, radio, and television will probably become increasingly common. It probably won’t be long before the major media conglomerates own most of the video game production firms as they seek to streamline production, distribution, and exhibition of music and other mass media materials.</p>
<p>Public advocates within the music and video game industries have wanted the Grammys to recognize video game music for years, especially since some Grammy-winning songs that eventually enjoyed popular release originated within video games. Traditional video gamers, however, should be very afraid. This is exactly what happened when <a href="http://www.viacom.com/Pages/default.aspx">Viacom</a> invaded MTV, and we all saw the results. Now that the Recording Academy is sticking its fingers into video games, the core teenage-male cult may start to witness even more commercialization and homogenization of the music in their once-underground medium. Video game music creators, once somewhat separate from the mainstream music industry and free to experiment in a way unknown at most of the modern corporate record labels, may now be pressured to tow the labels’ line.</p>
<p>Only time will tell how the relationship between the labels and the video game companies will develop. However, if the conglomerates’ past record with new media is any indication, the idiosyncratic array of music in many video games today may soon become an artifact of history.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Trust, G. (5 April 2011). ‘Glee’ cast, Matthew Morrison score first radio hit, thanks to original songs. <em>Billboard</em>. Retrieved from <a href="http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/industry/tv-film/glee-cast-matthew-morrison-score-first-1005113042.story">http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/industry/tv-film/glee-cast-matthew-morrison-score-first-1005113042.story</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://blogs.villagevoice.com/dailymusto/Glee-Cast-glee-9252428-600-429.jpg" alt="" width="241" height="173" />What’s the difference between <em>American Idol</em> and <em>Glee</em>? After all, both are television shows that promote the music industry. One difference is that, until now, Fox&#8217;s <em>Glee</em> wasn’t in the business of producing new artists. While some of the <em>Glee</em> cast’s covers have taken the Internet by storm and run quickly up the Billboard Top 100—<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds38BOOtGIQ"><em>Don’t Stop Believin’</em> may be the most famous</a>—they’re still just different versions of already-famous songs. All of that changed, however, with the recent release of the first song produced specifically for the show, called “Loser Like Me,” which has a critical advantage over all the covers: It’s getting radio airplay, premiering at #37 on the Nielson Adult Top 40.</p>
<p><span id="more-1082"></span></p>
<p>This, of course, is huge. The radio and sound recording industries have been connected at the hip since their mutual beginnings during the turn of last century. Radio is a critical facilitator for the music industry, introducing targeted demographics of consumers to new music; radio, in turn, relies on other media to supply fresh material for its listeners. Producers, for their part, are all too willing to do that. The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/26/business/26music.html?_r=1">desperation with which producers jockey for radio airtime</a> speaks to radio’s enduring importance to the music industry in the age of 200-channel television and iTunes. Increasingly these producers include the owners and creators of television shows like <em>Glee</em> who are hoping to run their content through another window.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The producers of <em>Glee</em>, like the labels that sign the <em>American Idol</em> winners, can opt out of this desperation because their artists are practically guaranteed airplay. <em>Glee</em>’s enormous popularity on television means that the cast’s music, which premieres on the show, is practically “pre-sold.” Radio program directors take huge risks when they add new music to their playlists, and they’re always looking for ways to reduce that risk. What better way to do that than to play music that’s already popular on other media, like television?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indeed, the <em>Glee</em> cast’s transition from mere facilitators pimping other artists’ music every week to producers releasing new material has been nearly seamless, with program directors scrambling to play the new music. The music fits perfectly with what the modern pop radio industry wants: It’s upbeat, unchallenging, and <a href="http://www.billboard.com/news/glee-returns-with-huge-ratings-win-1004115894.story#/news/glee-returns-with-huge-ratings-win-1004115894.story">already popular with that crucial 18-34-year old audience</a> (<em>Glee</em> consistently ranks #1 among that audience, teenagers in general, and teenage girls in particular, the equivalent of a royal flush for Fox). Interviews with program directors across the country confirm that sentiment, with one program director in Indiana lauding the new song’s ability to “resonate with kids and parents” and admitting that the new song’s origins in <em>Glee</em> give it a “leg up” in gaining airplay on her station.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <em>Glee</em> cast will soon promote their new music by going out on tour, with 22 scheduled appearances set to begin on June 22nd in Minneapolis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The success of <em>Glee</em>’s new music speaks to the power of a popular program to travel across media. With a variety of television shows either playing others’ music or facilitating the production of new music, the synergy between the two industries has never been stronger. Media industries like radio, sound recording, and television help each other reduce risk by mutually sharing popular content, which translates into stronger revenues for the large conglomerates that own most media companies today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whether that translates into more choice for consumers, however, is questionable. Public advocates continue to argue that the sharing of content across media, especially unchallenging content like the <em>Glee</em> music that appeals to the lowest common denominator, drowns out artists and voices with alternative views that may challenge the media conglomerates. Until popular music stops making money, however, the conglomerates are likely to continue to encourage this type of cross-promotion of content into the future.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Peoples, G. (29 March 2011). Amazon beats Apple and Google to the cloud. <em>Billboard</em>. Retrieved from <a href="http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/industry/digital-and-mobile/amazon-beats-apple-and-google-to-the-cloud-1005098372.story">http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/industry/digital-and-mobile/amazon-beats-apple-and-google-to-the-cloud-1005098372.story</a></p>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://cdn.pocket-lint.com/images/zYQm/amazon-cloud-drive-streams-in-1.jpg?20110329-123718" alt="" width="221" height="137" />The last decade has witnessed fierce competition between media companies whose products were initially quite different. <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a>, that little search engine that could in the nineties, today locks horns with <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> in the Internet TV and music exhibition market. Now <a href="http://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a>, that erstwhile book distributor, has announced that it, too, is joining the digital music fray. In a move that will <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/apr/03/john-naughton-amazon-cloud-drive-google-sony">light a fire under product developers</a> at Apple and Google, Amazon announced the debut of its new digital music service <a href="https://www.amazon.com/clouddrive/learnmore/ref=sa_menu_acd_lrn2">Cloud Drive</a>, which allows users to share their own music across computers through the Internet (the “cloud”). And, true to form, the recording companies are already finding reasons to go berserk about it.</p>
<p><span id="more-1024"></span></p>
<p>Amazon, of course, has been both exhibiting and distributing music for years. The new service will make Amazon a facilitator, as well. Users will be able to create an Amazon account, upload existing music files or buy MP3s right from Amazon, and access that music on any Internet-capable computer. By facilitating users’ storage of existing MP3s, Amazon obviously hopes to draw more users into its own MP3 store in an imitation of Apple’s<a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/"> iTunes</a> success. The company even offers discounts on storage space based on the number of MP3s the user buys directly from Amazon. And why shouldn’t they buy? One digital copy of a song is about the same as any other, and Amazon’s MP3s can live on the Internet instead of just one computer. All the people who lost their entire iTunes library when attempting to transfer it from one computer to another should take note.</p>
<p>It looks like Amazon may actually make some money off of this. And wherever you find an outside company profiting from a music service, you find the <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-31001_3-20048499-261.html">major record labels preparing to sue them</a>. The exact details of the labels’ problem with the service are a bit sketchy, but the main concern is a new form of P2P file sharing. Cloud Drive technically only allows users to share music with themselves on different digital platforms, but if one user uploads thousands of songs and then starts selling their Cloud Drive password for $50 a pop, a nightmare could ensue for the recording industry.</p>
<p>The record labels, possibly weary of dragging all of the world’s 7 billion people through the U.S. legal system, have indicated that they’re willing to drop the issue if Amazon re-buys the licenses for the songs they distribute through Cloud Drive, thereby reducing the financial impact of possible mass file sharing. So far, Amazon has adamantly refused. They claim that they are simply providing users with an online external hard drive. The recording companies have pointed out that it’s much easier to share music online than through a physical hard drive, but Amazon argues that the two are legally the same.</p>
<p>In addition to the labels’ lust for making users pay every time two notes of a song hit their ears, Amazon must also find ways to compete with Google and Apple, who are already calling Cloud Drive an inferior product. Google’s upcoming digital music service has hit legal challenges from the labels before it even debuted, but Google claims it’s working through the challenges while developing features for users that will easily out-compete Cloud Drive, including easy ways to store video and photos as well as music. Amazon, for its part, is basking in the glow of both upstaging the record labels and being the first in the new market.</p>
<p>Only time will tell whether all digital content—music, video, etc.—will migrate to the cloud during the next few years, but with almost all the major technology companies developing cloud-driven products, it certainly seems likely. The recording companies may need to be dragged, kicking and screaming, into this future. Now that other companies are finding ways to let users expand their digital music options, the labels will have to continue finding ways to continue profiting from their products. That is the industry’s current challenge.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Peoples, G. (22 March 2011). Rebecca Black&#8217;s first-week sales: Not bad, but not in the millions&#8230;. <em>Billboard</em>. Retrieved from <a href="http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/industry/digital-and-mobile/rebecca-black-s-first-week-sales-not-bad-1005084972.story">http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/industry/digital-and-mobile/rebecca-black-s-first-week-sales-not-bad-1005084972.story</a></p>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://cdn03.okcdn.okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Rebecca_Black_March17newsnea.jpg" alt="" width="216" height="152" />For those who complain that modern music is formulaic and factory-produced…well, it just got worse. The <a href="http://arkmusicfactory.com/">Ark Music Factory</a> released a music video by its new “artist” <a href="http://arkmusicfactory.com/profile/rebeccablack">Rebecca Black</a> called “<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2LRROpph0">Friday</a>,” which quickly went viral for all the wrong reasons (click the link to watch the video, if you dare). Heralded as one of the worst songs ever produced, the song quickly skyrocketed the teen singer into the public spotlight. The formulaic, ready-made, culturally-deficient song provided material for columnists and pundits all week and raised the ire of public advocates who claim that the Ark Music Factory is destroying music.</p>
<p><span id="more-991"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Ark Music Factory is actually only one of many “vanity” labels, which provide wannabe stars with pre-written songs, low-budget videos, and distribution and exhibition deals through <a href="http://www.cdbaby.com/">CD Baby</a> and<a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/"> iTunes</a> in exchange for a fee. Black’s mother reportedly paid Ark’s standard fee of $2,000 for her daughter’s trip into YouTube notoriety. And most of that money is probably profit for Ark. The shockingly underdressed tweens in Black’s music video are apparently Black’s friends and neighbors who agreed to hop into the video in exchange for their own three minutes of fame (and, as it turned out, humiliation).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Surprisingly, however, Black is already definitely making money from the song. As exploitative as Ark Music Factory sounds, it may treat its “artists” better than the major labels. After the $2,000 upfront fee, a 9% commission to Black’s distributor, CD Baby, and 9.1 cents per track to Ark for the use of the abominably-written song, Black keeps the rest. In fact, Ark even gives its “artists” copyright ownership of their recordings. Billboard reports that, as of Wednesday, Black had sold about 40,000 tracks through iTunes, and that number continues to rise. After crunching the numbers, Billboard reported that Black had already made about $25,000, pure profit, on the single. Considering that some of the biggest stars in the world—European grand-standing tours, MTV appearances, <em>Behind the Music</em> specials—are still in the red with their labels after selling millions of tracks, Rebecca Black may be the luckiest person in the music industry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And it’s not just Rebecca Black. Ark’s other “artists,” including <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xHfRUW99aI">Alana Lee</a>, are also apparently selling tracks and making money, and have been for awhile thanks the equalizing exhibition power of iTunes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ark can operate this way because of an ingenious business plan, which was partially stolen from the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgXg_7kVI8">Disney</a> model. First, they employ creators who actually write the songs for pennies per word. A sampling of Ark’s other songs reveals that the lyrics to each basically consist of “butterfly,” “soul,” and various days of the week scrambled into different combinations. And while that may be both hilarious and a sign of the End of Art, it’s also economically smart. As others have pointed out, who cares if the lyrics are bad? After all, it’s really no worse than much of what the major labels are putting out, probably for hundreds of dollars per word.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ark then produces the video and the song, both cheaply. The actual music was clearly produced by a synthesizer you can probably buy at Radio Shack, as was most of Black’s voice in the video. Again, so what? The song is catchy and upbeat, and that seems to be what most of the music industry’s audience wants.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then, Ark simply arranges a distribution deal with CD Baby and puts the song on iTunes and YouTube for exhibition. A few phone calls to music industry contacts from some of the Ark staff, some of whom allegedly facilitated Miley Cyrus’ rise to stardom (anyone surprised?), and this horrible song becomes the talk of the Internet. Ark provides all the resources for production and the linking pins that get the final product promoted on television and the Internet. Everyone involved is making money.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s also entirely possible that Ark made the song and the video bad on purpose. As they say, all press is good press. Sites like <a href="http://gawker.com/#!5783433/the-internet-made-rebecca-black-cry">Gawker</a> and Billboard that lampoon the video actually<img class="alignright" src="http://static.tvguide.com/MediaBin/Content/110321/News/4_thurs/110324RebeccaBlack1.jpg" alt="" width="257" height="177" /> actas Black’s best facilitators. Links to the video and to Ark Music Factory have appeared on almost every major hipster site in the past few weeks, and both Black and her mother have done interviews with the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9quaQjlzcOs">major networks’ morning shows</a> and with <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vQQucUWx50">Jay Leno</a>. A million indie artists who slaved over their life’s work for years before producing a song that no one listened to are weeping. Black has even become famous enough to <a href="http://www.contactmusic.com/news.nsf/story/internet-sensation-to-hand-over-itunes-cash-to-japan-relief-groups_1209597">start a relief fund for Japan</a>! Clearly, Ark is doing something right here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many would say, however, that Ark is also doing a lot wrong. The list of things wrong with this entire story is long, but there are things to think about here beyond just snarky comments about helicopter parents and why 13-year olds are wearing tube tops in a music video. The most pressing: Is this really what it’s come to in the music industry? People who advocate for diversity in the recording industry <a href="http://www.motherboard.tv/2011/3/18/the-ark-music-factory-is-churning-out-pop-slop-for-the-internet-s-cringeworthy-enjoyment">point out</a> that these sorts of songs may make sense economically, but they may be destroying America culturally. After all, this formulaic music mostly catches on because people with money and power—in this case, Ark and the Disney-bots they hire—can promote and distribute them across media. What about music’s ability to challenge authority and expose social issues? If songs like “Friday” are really the future of music, how will music’s role in society change?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Ark Music Factory and Rebecca Black may not care. In fact, they may accurately see themselves as the only ones in the music industry who are honest about what they do. The major labels often defend themselves against accusations of homogeneity by saying that they are producing and facilitating “art,” and “behind the scenes” shows about all the creative energy that goes into making a hit song abound. In reality, of course, Ark Music Factory is no more of a “factory” than many of the big labels.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If Ark Music Factory has a role in furthering American culture, it may be to increase the public’s awareness about how music is really produced.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bruno, A. (16 March 2011). MTV launches Hive website, latest effort to refocus on music. <em>Billboard</em>. Retrieved from <a href="http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/industry/digital-and-mobile/mtv-launches-hive-website-latest-effort-1005075732.story#">http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/industry/digital-and-mobile/mtv-launches-hive-website-latest-effort-1005075732.story#</a></p>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/photos/stylus/1037809-MTV-Hive.png" alt="" width="200" height="140" />The empty acronym formerly known as Music Television (MTV) debuted a new website this week that focuses on…music. The new site, called “<a href="http://www.mtvhive.com/">Hive</a>,” will feature music videos, interviews, book reviews by artists, polls, music popularity tracking meters, and editorials by the company’s top executives. It appears to represent an effort by MTV to reinvent its image after recent Reality- show scandals, including a child pornography investigation surrounding its shock-schlock show <em>Skins</em>.</p>
<p><span id="more-955"></span></p>
<p>MTV wasn’t always a Reality TV depot. At its peak, MTV was one of the most important exhibitors in the music industry. Eighties and nineties kids often heard new music for the first time on the network’s popular request shows, and MTV’s decision to promote or marginalize a new artist could make or break a recording company’s profits for an entire year. The network also transformed the music video into a form of mass media, forcing the labels to dump millions of dollars a year into producing high-quality and catchy videos for audiences.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, over a decade after jumping onto the Reality TV bandwagon, MTV apparently wants to recapture some of its former image (and power). The network will exhibit music on the site, with a section for users to access new and vintage music videos and buy MP3s. Alongside the actual music will be polls that track users’ opinions of new artists, videos that feature <a href="http://www.mtvhive.com/playlists/76BA27020227BA7600010227BA76/mgid:playlist:video:mtvmusic.com:71585">sometimes bizarre</a> consumer reviews of music videos, and a feature called <a href="http://www.mtvmusicmeter.com/">Music Meter</a>, which claims to track an artists’ popularity on social media and downloading sites. MTV’s many Top Ten countdowns and on-air VJ reviews made it a facilitator for the music industry since its inception, and network executives are clearly hoping to carry that role online. To help with the transition, the network is bringing in veteran music industry linking pin Jessica Robertson, who helped <em><a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/">Rolling Stone</a> </em>and <em><a href="http://www.spinner.com/">Spinner</a></em> digitize and re-format their content for the Internet age.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In some ways, it’s surprising that MTV waited so long to overhaul its website. This is the network that has exploited almost every synergistic media connection possible, from television series to a movie division. Now that MTV is finally ready to “flex some music muscles,” as network president Van Toffler says, it may already be too late. MTV’s core demographic, the teen to twenties group, has been getting MP3s and music news online from sources that look suspiciously like MTV’s new website, including <a href="http://www.billboard.com/#/">Billboard</a>, for over a decade. Hive will have to include some outstanding features to draw users away from their established online music outlets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One notable feature of the site is the complete lack of traditional “advertising.” Of course, that’s largely because the site is one big advertisement for all artists whose labels have made deals with MTV to sell merchandise, concert tickets, and MP3s on the site, along with other promotion deals. In fact, the same criticisms that the network faced at its peak are likely to carry over to the new website. For years, critics argued that MTV was the prime homogenization force in the music industry, squeezing out smaller artists whose indie labels couldn’t pay to make high-profile deals with the network. It’s not hard to imagine that any concert tickets or merchandise sold on Hive won’t be for your local neighborhood ska band’s next gig. It’s not really that MTV doesn’t like indie artists. MTV has a bottom line to worry about, and music and promotion deals with Sony and EMI are more likely to increase it than smaller labels.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, it’s not really MTV doing all these things at all. MTV is actually owned by <a href="http://www.viacom.com/Pages/default.aspx">Viacom</a>, a massive media conglomerate that owns a number of television channels (including Nickelodeon) and a diversified portfolio of other media holdings. Viacom is interested in promoting the same content across multiple channels and making deals with reliable companies who they know will follow through on their commitments. Large national corporations don’t necessarily have time to deal with the eccentric smaller indie labels. MTV probably initially jumped into bed with Viacom because it couldn’t afford to do that, either. Like most things, it all comes down to money.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MTV apparently hopes to offer more local music listings and services in the future, but there’s no trace of those features on Hive. As the Internet becomes the primary exhibition and distribution outlet for music, corporations like MTV that specialize in music may eventually have to “own the local” in much the same way newspapers and radio stations had to with the advent of television. It’s too early to tell whether Hive will allow MTV to re-enter some of its former power roles in the music industry. Given Viacom’s financial backing, however, the network certainly has a fighting chance.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://iphoneroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/itunes_24bit_music.jpg" alt="" width="195" height="134" />Antony, B. (22 February 2011). Interscope&#8217;s Jimmy Iovine fighting the 24-bit fight. <em>Billboard</em>. Retrieved from <a href="http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/industry/digital-and-mobile/interscope-s-jimmy-iovine-fighting-the-24-1005044072.story#">http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/industry/digital-and-mobile/interscope-s-jimmy-iovine-fighting-the-24-1005044072.story#</a></p>
<p>Forget CDs! The real format war in the recording industry is between 16-bit and 24-bit audio files, and some industry executives are taking the 24-bit side. Interscope CEO Jimmy Iovine and Columbia Records Co-President Rick Rubin are pressuring other labels to start releasing audio files to iTunes in the higher-quality 24-bit format, ostensibly in an effort to improve the user’s experience. Unfortunately for users, the price of the new format may increase along with the quality.</p>
<p><span id="more-921"></span></p>
<p>But which users will buy these new 24-bit files? In a world where CDs still form the bulk of the industry’s profits, it seems silly for industry executives to promote an upgrade from an iTunes file format that nobody’s complaining about. However, it’s not the first format upgrade the industry’s initiated. In fact, the industry aggressively promoted CDs back in the late eighties and ended up with a years-long boom in profits as everyone switched to the new format. Maybe industry executives are hoping to mirror their success with CDs by promoting another “higher-quality” format for which they can charge more.</p>
<p>The future of this plan, however, hinges on Iovine and Rubin’s success in recruiting other industry executives to their side. As producers, both executives worry about their companies’ future profitability, and history shows that every media company promoting its own personal format isn’t conducive to higher profits for anyone. Both surely remember the <a href="http://www.mediacollege.com/video/format/compare/betamax-vhs.html">disastrous VHS-Beta war of the eighties</a>. The industry’s continued existence may rely on multiple producers banding together under one format.</p>
<p>It’s also possible that, after alienating the bulk of their digital fan base with <a href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2008/09/proving-file-sh/">frivolous file-sharing lawsuits</a>, record industry executives like Iovine and Rubin are eager to prove that they’re still on the users’ side. What better way to do this than to don the public advocate hat and pretend that what’s good for the record industry is what’s good for America? After all, the higher-quality music may enrich users’ overall experience—and would probably sound <em>great</em> under some of Iovine’s <a href="http://www.beatsbydre.com/">“Beats by Dre” line headphones</a>!</p>
<p>The real linchpin in this scheme is, of course, <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/">Apple</a>. Industry executives can release music in any format they want, but Apple’s software and devices need to play them. As music distribution and exhibition responsibilities pass from “one-stops” to iTunes, Apple’s cooperation becomes a crucial component of any business strategy in the music industry. Iovine is working with Apple and says they’ve been “great,” which must be the new euphemism for “greedy.” Everyone who understands Apple knows they won’t agree to reconfigure their software and devices to run a new, higher-priced format without reconfiguring the way they manage profits from sales of that new, higher-priced music. Financial details are sketchy, but with industry executives and Apple executives (is there a difference anymore?) on either end of the bargaining table, the negotiations should be intense.</p>
<p>The real issue, however, revolves around whether music fans care more about quality of music or convenience of access. Another executive at Sony pointed out that users historically care more about convenience. And as every Internet user knows, accessing music online has never been more convenient. If a new 24-bit format became standard right now, it’s likely that the only major change would be more 24-bit files on <a href="http://thepiratebay.org/">Pirate Bay</a>.</p>
<p>Maybe industry executives should focus on getting people to pay for the existing 16-bit format before promoting new digital formats.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“Ricky Martin to be honored by GLAAD.” (9 February 2011). Associated Press. Billboard. Retrieved from <a href="http://www.billboard.com/#/news/ricky-martin-to-be-honored-by-glaad-1005026962.story">http://www.billboard.com/#/news/ricky-martin-to-be-honored-by-glaad-1005026962.story</a></p>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://www.rumromanismrebellion.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/ricky_martin.jpg" alt="" width="168" height="167" />The <a href="http://www.glaad.org/">Gay and Lesbian Alliance against Defamation (GLAAD)</a> will honor Ricky Martin and actress/Broadway singer Kristin Chenoweth at their 22nd Annual Media Awards on March 19. The group promotes individuals from the media industry who promote LBGT individuals’ rights and contribute to their acceptance in the industry in general. The group specifically wants to honor Martin’s contribution to helping Latino LBGT individuals openly “come out,” as <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/ricky-martin-fortunate-homosexual-man/story?id=10234454">Martin himself did just last year</a>.</p>
<p><span id="more-782"></span></p>
<p>Some might question GLAAD’s decision to honor someone who waited so long to “come out.” Martin’s been around for over a decade, and he deferred questions about his sexuality for most of those years. However, the enormous personal and political risks of “coming out” in the media industry probably made Martin hesitate to talk openly about what everyone suspected. Overt discrimination was certainly possible, but the public derision and lampooning that awaits openly gay artists may have been the greater fear. And what would “coming out” do to Martin’s relationship with his label, especially back in the late nineties when he was an up-and-coming artist? When a new artist is up for promotion by a label, it’s sometimes advisable for him to keep potential controversies at bay, especially if the label is targeting a mainstream market.</p>
<p>In fact, Martin’s choice to “come out” now probably reflects his increased power as a creator in the music industry. He pulls his own weight with his label now and boasts a large and diverse fan base, and so feels sure enough that his sexuality will no longer adversely affect his career. It&#8217;s even possible that, with so many openly-gay or gay-supporting artists on the scene right now (read: Lady Gaga), &#8220;coming out&#8221; as  LBGT today can help to boost an artist&#8217;s career. However, that was not necessarily the case only a decade ago.</p>
<p>In many ways, GLAAD hopes to encourage the media industry to be more supportive of those LBGT up-and-coming artists, rather than forcing them into the closet until they become popular enough to “come out” safely. GLAAD’s public advocacy role here is clear: They are trying to increase representation in all media industries, including the sound recording industry, for LBGT artists. At its core, this is an <a href="http://www.ethnicmajority.com/media_home.htm">age-old demand for more diverse views in American media</a>. GLAAD&#8217;s cause, however, may be gaining ground. The large fan base of artists like Martin, whose sexuality was never truly a secret, proves that sexuality matters less and less compared to talent. There are more openly LBGT individuals in the media industry today than ever before. And the recording industry now routinely uses these individuals to target niche markets. In Martin’s case, not only the LBGT community, but also specifically the <em>Latino</em> LBGT community may now be more receptive to his music.</p>
<p>Sex and identity politics have always been part of the business strategy of the record industry. Incorporating LBGT sexuality and identity into that strategy ultimately doesn’t take much imagination. That profit motive and pressures from groups like GLAAD may contribute to a new openness in the industry toward openly LBGT artists.</p>

<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://www.realtvcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/american-idol-new-judges-2010.jpg" alt="" width="220" height="166" />Call it the <em>American Idol</em> Effect: Sales of Aerosmith’s music have shot up 250% since front man Steven Tyler signed on as a judge for the show. All of the band’s previous albums saw triple-digit increases after the Jan. 19 premiere of the show, reversing a pattern of decline in sales of the band&#8217;s music.</p>
<p><span id="more-774"></span></p>
<p>The judges are certainly not the only ones in the sound recording industry to benefit from the show. In fact, the show is the culmination of every synergistic collaboration between the television and sound recording industries <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1wIXIFfrXI">since the Beatles played Ed Sullivan</a>. The label that lands the newly-crowned superstar can eliminate the heated board meeting where executives argue about which new artist to promote. The risk that this audience-tested artist will fail is next to nil, minimizing the label’s risk for that year. Meanwhile, Fox cashes in on the desperation of a thousand wannabe superstars—and America’s willingness to watch them. And three judges get an instant plug for their music careers. How many Generation Y kids knew about Paula Abdul before <em>American Idol</em> cast her as a foil to Simon Cowell (a former music industry executive)? Now Steven Tyler and his label are hoping for their turn to leech off the show’s success. So far, it appears to be working.</p>
<p>It’s hardly surprising that <em>American Idol</em> chose someone like Tyler for its new judge panel. He’s interesting—frizzy hair, weird clothes, raspy heavy-smoker voice—but also very mainstream and popular across demographics. He’s a celebrity with a track record of selling product both with and without Aerosmith, having made very successful appearances as a commentator on the MTV-VH1 feature shows. And crucially, he’s surprisingly nice. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA8nvJfvdTk">According to the Associated Press</a>, Fox apparently wants a “kinder” American Idol after Cowell’s departure, and hopes to focus on the human interest stories the network has decided its audience craves. Tyler—more Abdul than Cowell—fits into this target personality.</p>
<p>Tyler derives his own benefits from the relationship. His status as a creator skyrockets in two industries. The celebrity judges are key to the show’s success, and the show’s producers know it. Tyler and his fellow judges therefore have a definite say in how the show looks and sounds. It’s also likely that, <a href="http://www.realitytvworld.com/news/simon-cowell-confirms-world-got-talent-global-reality-project-11113.php">like Cowell</a>, Tyler will use the show as a springboard to land other television projects. Meanwhile, the show is one giant promotion for Aerosmith’s upcoming album, as Tyler receives the full fawning attention of the television industry’s facilitators in the entertainment news industry, TV guide, and many others. As a CD on a rack, they wouldn’t give him a second glance, but he becomes interesting by virtue of being on TV. All of <em>American Idol’s</em> reviews come right back to benefit the band and garner them new fans.</p>
<p>And, as always, a whole team of people are probably cashing paychecks for yet again serving as the linking pin between Tyler and TV. It seems everyone’s making money. Tyler and the band certainly hope the cash flow will continue coming their way after they release their new album.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Herrera, M. (31 January 2011). Eminem to star in Super Bowl claymation ad: Report.  <em>Billboard</em>.  Retrieved from <a href="http://www.billboard.com/search/?keyword=eminem#/news/eminem-to-star-in-super-bowl-claymation-1005016312.story">http://www.billboard.com/search/?keyword=eminem#/news/eminem-to-star-in-super-bowl-claymation-1005016312.story</a></p>

<p>Lipton Brisk Iced Tea has a treat for Super Bowl ad enthusiasts this year: Eminem in Claymation! The rapper allegedly landed an appearance in Lipton’s $1 million ad spot, set to air during the February 6th game, which features a clay version of him going through “a day in the life” of a superstar. The Claymation theme harks back to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-g8opm1ZmY&amp;playnext=1&amp;list=PL3AEE3D248A17A481">a classic Lipton ad campaign that once featured Frank Sinatra</a>.</p>
<p><span id="more-719"></span></p>
<p>Eminem’s participation in the ad reveals the continuing attempts at synergy between the sound recording industry and the television advertising departments of major companies like Lipton. It especially represents the sound recording industry’s attempt to nab its own piece of the Super Bowl revenue pie. Advertisers realized long ago that the Super Bowl’s ability to reach multiple demographics—a rare ability indeed in this era of fragmented cable audiences—makes the mega-million-dollar ad spaces worth the price. The sound recording industry, in turn, can exploit the advertisers’ need for celebrity endorsements to give their ads that extra pizazz. Clay Eminem drinks some clay tea for Lipton and Lipton gets Eminem (and his new album) in front of the 18-34 audience. Everyone wins. This has been going on since (and long before) <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8qtsUaoVak&amp;feature=related">Madonna teamed up with Pepsi during the 1980s to release her “Like a Prayer” video</a>. The fact that everyone remembers that ad testifies to the strategy’s potential.</p>
<p>Lurking somewhere behind all these joint sound recording-television ventures is a person or persons who are serving what Turow would call “linking pin” roles. These are the people who try to “link” someone or something from one medium (in this case, sound recording) to another (in this case, television). Since Eminem owns his own record label, he’s almost certainly in full promo mode for his new album, <em>Relapse</em>, through traditional sound recording channels like radio and new ones like iTunes. However, the Super Bowl ad offers a vastly expanded audience and possibly access to new TV-watching fans. In the new Information Age, artists who <em>don’t</em> venture into media outside of their industries are already behind.</p>
<p>Indeed, Eminem’s “linking pins” (which may include himself) have been hard at work even outside of preparing a Super Bowl ad appearance. In addition to television, he’s apparently eying a film role in an upcoming DreamWorks picture.</p>
<p>Why all this branching out in the music industry? While recording artists are no strangers to working within the television and film worlds, some of the recent expansion into other media may reflect concerns about illegal downloading. New file sharing outfits seem to pop up faster than the record labels can file lawsuits against them. The possibility of decreasing profit potential within the traditional sound recording industry may motivate artists like Eminem to explore work in other media industries and to seek new advertising opportunities.</p>
<p>Only time will tell how successful these explorations will be for the future of the sound recording industry.</p>
