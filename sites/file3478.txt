<p>RBR-TVBR. (2011, April, 25). In-car streaming perceptions, misperceptions examined. <em>Radio Broadcasting Report.</em> Retrieved from http://www.rbr.com/radio/in-car-streaming-numbers-perceptions-misperceptions-examined.html</p>
<p>With the increasing technological growth and use of internet-streaming radio stations such as Pandora, iHeartRadio, and other cloud-based sites, the public still recognizes that the production and distribution of “over-the-air” terrestrial radio remains one of the most used media outlets while driving.  In a recent Radio Broadcasting Report article, it was made known through a survey of 18-44 year olds, that having streaming-internet radio in cars is not a threat at all to the AM/FM radio stations, or even Sirius/XM.  &#8220;The good news is most users of in-car streaming radio continue to use over-the-air radio extensively&#8221; (rbr.com).</p>
<p><span id="more-1171"></span></p>
<p>Using the Automobile Industry as one of their linking pins, internet streaming radio is trying hard to stream themselves over other industries.  Maybe for the satisfaction of becoming a vertically integrated industry, the internet might be a little over zealous when trying to take over multiple media outlets.  The majority of these blogs have focused on the fact that internet radio sites like Pandora, iHeartRadio and many others are becoming major exhibitors for not only just music, but the recording industry itself.  The popularity of streaming internet stations in the car mostly comes from the linking pin of the cellphone industry.  People are able to buy cables that will simply connect their smartphone to the radio.  They won&#8217;t need to buy a full dashboard radio system that will connect their internet radio to the car.  &#8220;It is thought that most of that listening still occurs at home or at work on computers connected to the internet because of the perceived difficulties related to connecting to the internet in the car&#8221; (rbr.com).  When surveys are taken to see how many people are listening to internet radio, we cannot assume that it is just for the car, all these other media outlets still need to be taken into account.</p>
<p>Within the article there are perceptions noted that describe how certain industry and power roles are concerned with these internet radio stations taking over.  The internet might be able to vertically integrate themselves as producers, distributors, and exhibitors due to the fact that our information age has taken rise <em>because</em> of the internet.  To understand the perceptions (or misperceptions) of the internet radio streaming in cars, it would be better to read the <a href="http://www.rbr.com/radio/in-car-streaming-numbers-perceptions-misperceptions-examined.html">article</a> in full.  But in short the four perceptions are: that streaming is not yet happening in the car, once streaming becomes widely available in cars terrestrial radio will be dead, people won&#8217;t pay for an in-dash solution, consumers will want more pre-sets with in-dash systems.</p>
<p>Although this might be a huge exhibitor power role in the future, in-dash internet radio systems need a lot of adjustment to satisfy the consumer.  Although the client power role of the advertisers might see this as a great deal of business for them, only having one automobile producer and distributor for an internet radio system (Ford and its SYNC system) limits the possibility of substantial profit and growth.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Associated Press (4, April 2011).

<p>Cecillia Kang. (8, April 2011). Web firms face increased federal scrutiny over Internet privacy. <em>The Washington Post. </em>Retrieved from <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/web-firms-face-increased-federal-scrutiny-over-internet-privacy/2011/04/06/AFvREp1C_story.html">http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/web-firms-face-increased-federal-scrutiny-over-internet-privacy/2011/04/06/AFvREp1C_story.html</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Internet radio, such as Pandora, used with linking pin power roles such as the smartphone mobile industry, was recently subpoenaed by the government on the terms of illegal distribution of personal information.  When a user logs into an internet related radio site on their smartphone, their private information is given to that certain company to be distributed to their client power role, the advertisers.  Using Pandora, (although other internet related radio websites have been included in this court hearing) a federal grand jury served this subpoena in order to justify that these services disclose users personal information such as telephone number, gender, personal interests, and other information, illegally.</p>
<p><span id="more-1100"></span></p>
<p>Not only are the internet radio sites being reevaluated for their privacy terms, but most of the internet is also, involving the internet power role.  In a Washington post article, the associated press tells that the Federal Trades Commission is now wanting to post a &#8220;Do Not Track&#8221; option for internet users.  The federal grand jury investigation is prominent on declining Pandora&#8217;s ability to access users information from their smartphone accounts.  Having advertisers as client power roles, Pandora released the private information to third parties for these advertisers to see the demographics and the amount of users on their site.  &#8220;Pandora said it shared information with third parties to help it track how users interact with the service and to deliver targeted advertising. But the company, based in Oakland, Calif., said it was “not a specific target” of the grand jury investigation.&#8221; (NYtimes.com)</p>
<p>Because internet radio is an enormous distributor and exhibitor power role, it will be extremely hard to shut it down; along with all the other cloud-based radio stations.  But having the &#8220;Do Not Track&#8221; option on their website will definitely create a boundary when it comes to gathering information for targeting their audiences for their paying advertisers.  &#8220;In its filing, Pandora said that a government Do Not Track mandate &#8216;could significantly hinder our ability to collect and use data relating to listeners&#8217; &#8220;(NYtimes.com).</p>

</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are we beginning to count on the Internet for everything?  Not only are we beginning to rely on our music playlists created on online streaming cloud-based sites, but the founders of Skype are betting on our usual creation of playlists created in iTunes, are moving to &#8216;<a href="http://www.indystar.com/article/20110403/BUSINESS06/304030004/1281/BUSINESS06">celestial jukeboxes</a>&#8216; listened to through the Internet.  These internet radio stations, and cloud-based playlist options, are becoming new distributors for artists&#8217; music.  We aren&#8217;t completely forgetting about terrestrial radio in cars, and on systems in the house, but when people are choosing to listen to these internet streams they immediately think, well&#8230; can I play this in my car? Around the house?  In the bathroom?  And with the emergence of new technologies that support the access of these internet &#8220;user-created&#8221; stations and playlists, industries of many different types want to get their feet in the door.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span id="more-1043"></span></p>
<p>Linking with the music industry, radio is now becoming an on-demand service.  Listeners are able to pick their music, and if they have the technologies acquired for listening to their music, they will be more than willing to do so.  The automobile industry, smartphone industry, and the television industry are all becoming exhibitors and distributors for this idea of the &#8221; &#8216;celestial jukebox&#8217; of the Internet, allowing listeners to play virtually any song, any time, anywhere, through a variety of Internet-linked devices.&#8221;  Not only do we see the Internet becoming a huge producer and distributor for the internet radio, its facilitation is allowing for extreme variety when it comes to listening to music.</p>
<p>This is extremely threatening to FM/AM radio.  Those who will have access to these streaming sites will begin to acknowledge the fact that they are willing to pay a subscription fee/month to be able to listen to any music of their choice.  Instead of turning on the radio, hearing the same 20 songs played by the hour, and listening to boring, ever-lasting advertisements, they can subscribe to the internet radio sites, create their own playlists, and enjoy the music that they want to hear.  Some of these cloud-based sites aren&#8217;t subscription based yet, so they still need the support of the advertising power role, but in time they will build up to being subscription based.</p>
<p>&#8220;<a href="http://mog.com/">Mog</a> and <a href="http://www.rdio.com/">Rdio</a> offer subscribers unlimited access for a set monthly fee &#8212; $9.99 for both companies. For that amount, subscribers can select any song from a catalog of 8 million to 10 million tunes and listen through any device connected to the Internet.&#8221;  These are other Internet radio sites like Pandora and Slacker radio, and are giving people the chance of unlimited access for a small fee.  These sites can be accessed in the car, on a smartphone, and even on the television. &#8221; For times they lack an Internet connection, subscribers can store songs to a phone or laptop, music they can use as long as they subscribe.&#8221;  This is an extremely important feature because I&#8217;m sure the client-based roles were concerned with this aspect.  Not only could this bump out iTunes as a music distributor and exhibitor, but it can also knock out mp3&#8217;s and CD&#8217;s.  All in all, the internet is beginning to control not only social life, but how we now listen to music, and understand radio.  We don&#8217;t envision radio as talkshows, or advertisements anymore, because we have the ability to create the music played for us on &#8220;our&#8221; own, creator made radio stations.</p>

<p>Radio News. (2011, March 22). Report: Howard Stern sues Sirius XM for More Money. <em>rbr.com. </em>Retrieved from <a href="http://www.rbr.com/radio/report-howard-stern-sues-sirius-xm-for-more-money.html">http://www.rbr.com/radio/report-howard-stern-sues-sirius-xm-for-more-money.html</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On March 22 2011, the press released breaking news that Sirius/XM&#8217;s biggest client, Howard Stern, is suing for more money.  Although this is a quick switch from the most recent post on Clear Channel Radio, this news is important to satellite radio due to the fact that it shows an increasing producer power role that Stern holds.  Stern had renewed his <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/analyst-howard-stern-sirius-xm-58336">contract</a> in December of 2010 for five more years on Sirius/XM radio.  Being offered a spot on terrestrial radio, Stern declined because he realized the strength and growth in Sirius/XM&#8217;s distribution role.  Yet, he is suing because the money that he was to gain from the Sirius/XM stock revenue seen from subscription growth, was not paid to him.<span id="more-1005"></span></p>
<p>“When Sirius needed Stern, it promised him a share in any success that the company achieved,” the suit says. “But now that Sirius has conquered its chief competitor and acquired more than 20 million subscribers, it has reneged on its commitment to Stern, unilaterally deciding that it has paid him enough.”  Although these claims were made from stock reports in 2008/2009, this was the time when Stern did not see the monetary claims.</p>
<p>Yes, Stern obtains copious amounts of money, but his power role could be one of the reasons for saving Sirius radio after they had merged with XM radio in 2009, before reaching bankruptcy.  Not only a producer power role, Stern and his production company also play as facilitators.  They helped facilitate satellite radio with (even though the amount of listeners for Stern has not been released) audience growth from 600,000 listeners in 2009, to 60 million.  So, for Sirius/XM to lose Stern, they might possibly lose an extreme amount of listeners.  Stern left terrestrial (AM/FM) radio because of his inappropriate content (decided by the FCC), however,the FCC authority (government) power role has no control over satellite radio waves,  allowing him to talk about anything and everything, with whatever language he wanted to use.</p>
<p>Stern gained popularity through news headlines and articles about him leaving the terrestrial stations, but after that hype ended, Stern understood that satellite radio was his next move due to the fact that it had great potential for subscribers, which was a good idea on his part.  Since this court case report is so recent, there have been no conclusions as of yet, but if Sirius/XM want to continue with Stern, they will need to compromise and understand that Stern holds a big part of their power roles.</p>

<p>Not only is Clear Channel enhancing their exhibitor role, they are using the auxiliary power role of Thumbplay&#8217;s cloud-based technology.  They are reaching the ideals of collaboration with local radio stations, which is needed for local radio stations to survive.  Not only are listeners able to create their own playlists, they are still able to stream their favorite local radio stations from their iPhone, Android, Blackberry&#8217;s, and Windows 7 phones.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thumbplay (which charges 9.99 per month) will also give Clear Channel the capability to deploy a variety of subscription services as it moves to leverage its radio assets across all digital platforms, including the Internet, automotive and mobile devices. Remember, <a href="http://www.rbr.com/features/ideas-working-now/clear-channels-iheartradio-hits-the-road.html" target="_blank">Toyota will integrate Clear Channel’s iheartradio</a> mobile app into select models starting this year.&#8221;  Not only does this show a linking-pin to the automotive industry, it establishes Thumbplay as a huge exhibitor role, also as client based because of the subscription money needed to support it.  John Hogan, CEO of Clear Channel, states in his business release that &#8220;iHeartRadio will build on our position as the leaders in digital radio, offering an unparalleled combination of features and reach &#8212; to our listeners, advertisers, artists, music labels, and other partners – not available anywhere else.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align: left">http://www.rbr.com (2011, Feb 15). &#8220;Sirius XM not feeling threatened by Pandora.&#8221; <em>RBR Business Report</em>.Retrieved from<a href="http://www.rbr.com/radio/sirius-xm-not-feeling-threatened-by-pandora.html"> http://www.rbr.com/radio/sirius-xm-not-feeling-threatened-by-pandora.html</a></p>
<p>Because Pandora is trying to increase profit through IPO investors within Wall Street, people are beginning to ask if Sirius XM Radio is starting to feel threatened by this online <em>free</em> radio station.  But the CEO, Mel Karmizin, speaks out, saying that he feels no threat due to the fact that if indeed Pandora starts growing and making profit, they will increase in advertisements, almost making their station equal to those of terrestrial radio.  Terrestrial radio is AM and FM, so Karmizin gives radio commercialization a negative tone.  Who would want their Pandora station to be like that of terrestrial radio?  That means even more commercial interruption between songs, meaning more waiting for listeners when they thought Pandora would be the station to give them quick music when they want it.  Therefore, Pandora, and other free online radio stations, are no threat to Karmizin and his Satellite radio.</p>
<p><span id="more-856"></span></p>
<p>Commercials are not related at all to Sirius, they get their money through subscription.  Growth in subscription is showing that in future revenue, Sirius does not look like they will be facing any financial problems.  They have hundreds of channels that differ from music, talk shows, and comedy channels.  Karmizin is completely confident that his business will not fall to free internet radio. In relation to the IP (Internet Protocol) audio content of the article, Karmizin said that if it is what his subscribers want, he will do what he can to satisfy them.  The IP content is what internet users like most when they go to their radio stations online.  Streaming is fast, and they can avoid having break ups from Satellite.  But, if Sirius needs to make their content quicker, Karmizin will find a way, but still making profit through subscription.</p>

<div><span id="more-793"></span></div>
<div>These ideals create reason for Pandora to being to seek revenue for their site.   It is a unique site, therefore a &#8220;Wall Street&#8221; investment with an IPO (Initial Public Offering) to give Pandora capital to expand their intentions of keeping this site active for unique creativity of their users and potential users.  “Pandora is the leader in internet radio in the United States, offering a personalized experience for each of our listeners. We have pioneered a new form of radio – one that uses intrinsic qualities of music to initially create stations and then adapts playlists in real-time based on the individual feedback of each listener.&#8221;  This was quoted in the article by the Pandora company to give reasons as to why this hundred million dollar investment will be worth while and show great prospect in the future. Again, Pandora hopes to provide itself with more capital for expansion without incurring any debt. The risk is that the stock may lose value should investors lose faith in the company&#8217;s ability to make money, however because the company sees that Wall Street is being &#8220;receptive&#8221; to IPO&#8217;s in 2011, they have faith in this investment for the betterment of their company.</div>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rhoads, Eric. (2011, February 3.) Radio Always Gets Through When Others Cannot. Media Biz Bloggers. Retrieved from <a href="http://www.mediabizbloggers.com/eric-rhoads/115099564.htm">http://www.mediabizbloggers.com/eric-rhoads/115099564.htm</a>l.</p>
<p>Americans are beginning to rely more on their local radio stations for updates and information that will help notify them on what to do, what precautions to take, and how these intense winter months are going to affect them.  This is a huge step up for local stations due to the fact that the growing technologies of the internet and television have been taking the place of local radio&#8217;s abilities to give their communities the news.  But, from the start of these brutal winter weeks, communities have come together through their radio.  When every other way of communicating is diminished due to the severe weather, such as power outages, households being snowed in, wireless connectors crashing etc., radios still can be powered simply by the use of batteries.</p>
<p><span id="more-739"></span></p>
<p>Radio network teams are braving the storms to give their local communities information during this time of &#8220;weather chaos&#8221;.  These stations are becoming &#8220;media lifelines&#8221; for those communities that are being the most affected by these intense storms.  These local &#8220;teams of radio soldiers&#8221; are all coming together to gather up information that will help their communities and staying on the radio in 48 hour shifts.  This dedication shows that the radio industries will always be able to support American communities with staying on air to give important information that is always needed.  Rhoads says, &#8220;Moments like this define radio, and these are the times when station loyalties are solidified as consumers find radio is their lifeline to their communities.&#8221;  The importance of local radio stations is shown through times like these.</p>
<p>What is even the point of caring about local radio stations for just this one winter?  Although it seems as though local radio stations aren&#8217;t deemed as popular as stations that are on the Internet, satellite radio, or HD and digital radio, communities, and the radio industry itself, may be beginning to see, and appreciate more, the importance that local radio stations has for giving communities importance information when other media outlets cannot.</p>
<p>Citizens can rely on their radio stations because they know these stations care about them.  This realization further justifies the title of this article that radio always gets through when others cannot.</p>
