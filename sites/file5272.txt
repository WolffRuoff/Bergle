								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Now that we&#8217;ve got a foundation through our script, it&#8217;s time to start building from the ground up (aka it&#8217;s time to block the show!)</p>
<p>For the first time, the Sedehi Diversity Project will be performed in the round with a painted floor. We are grateful to the theatre department and to the company of &#8220;TAL: Beyond Imagination&#8221; for letting us use an abbreviated version of the set. The rainbow floor was actually painted by our very own ensemble member, James Briggs! We have a ton more space, a ton more seats, and we have a big responsibility to match the energy and strength of the space. Melina Economos, our director, is working tirelessly to make this piece really move. There must never be a dull moment on stage! So far, we are definitely headed in the right direction. As someone who watches it over and over again every weeknight, I have yet to grow tired of it.</p>
<p>What makes me so excited for this year&#8217;s production is, not only the production value, but the way that urgency for change is portrayed. We&#8217;ve been sitting here for years listening to similar scenarios from different students with a slow shift over all that time, but the volume and pace of this production portray that now is no longer the time to sit on these issues. Now is the time to act. Now is the time to affect change. We really hope the incoming class of 2022 feels that sense of urgency and uses it to help the rest of the student body make a real difference.</p>
<p>A lot of what this show does, from my perspective, is it calls its audiences to action. You&#8217;ll notice that there is already a lot of action taking place as is, but if people don&#8217;t feel like an actual shift is made, then there is probably a whole lot more to be done. A phrase we keep hearing is &#8220;a work in progress&#8221;, which is absolutely true. In order for &#8220;a work in progress&#8221; to become &#8220;a change&#8221; or &#8220;a shift&#8221; is when we all get up and do something. You&#8217;ll notice it when we talk about activism. We&#8217;re asking YOU to take a stand with us, to take action, and to be a part of the work in progress so we can get an actual change by the time the incoming class of 2022 graduates.</p>
<p>Below is our vlog from week 3. It&#8217;s a much lighter side of what happens as we work together to make this happen. Just so you know, we actually do have a lot of fun making this happen for the community.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello and welcome to the Sedehi Diversity Project for 2018! I am Armida Flores, the Production Manager for this year&#8217;s project. Basically, one of my many duties is to keep you all updated with our process of creating this incredible production. We&#8217;ve got 5 weeks to create something from nothing and present it to the incoming freshmen, the community, and, this year, our alumni as well!</p>
<p>We&#8217;re so incredibly excited to announce that there will be an alumni event happening this year for all of the past ensemble members of the Sedehi Diversity Project. Most alumni events at the college tend to attract about 15 alumni, but this year, we have about 50 alumni who are registered to attend! To that, I&#8217;d like to give a special shoutout and thanks to those alumni who will be attending for your passion and support for this project. We really wouldn&#8217;t be where we are without you. We are so excited to meet all of you and to discuss how far Muhlenberg has come over the last 13 years since the project began.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s all happening on August 25th. We&#8217;ve got a little bit of time until then.</p>
<p><strong>WEEK 1: July 22nd-28th</strong></p>
<p>Moving in and finally getting to see each other after so many poor-connection video chats was so refreshing and exciting. My personal feeling moving into our village suites was that this was finally gonna get moving. We had over 50 interviews transcribed and more on the way as well, so it felt like &#8220;we&#8217;re here and this is really happening and we have more than just an idea with what we&#8217;d like to perform&#8221;. We had Friday and Saturday to relax and get settled in for a bit, having movie nights and finishing up interview transcriptions.</p>
<p>Our very first rehearsal consisted of the one thing we have been prepping for since our first meeting&#8230; our own interviews. It was a fantastic way to finish off student interviews; getting to sit down in small groups of three and really listen to each other and appreciate each other&#8217;s experiences on campus.</p>
<p>We were faced with a disastrous week of rain as we began to sit and go over 50 transcriptions together, reading and picking out lines we&#8217;d like to use in our piece. We began at 6pm and would go (sometimes) to midnight, getting ten to eleven transcriptions done each night. It would have been completely torturous, until Interfaith showed up.</p>
<p>Interfaith and our ensemble ran into a bit of a dilemma when we were both under the impression that we were using the same space. Interfaith graciously agreed to host their social in the basement, which we are forever grateful for. They practically saved the rest of our week when they came upstairs and offered us the leftovers of their desserts. There was a beautiful vanilla mousse cake and a box of truffles. I think this really speaks to the impact that the Sedehi Diversity Project has on the Muhlenberg community and what it means to us. It feels so good to know that people are responding and really hold this project close to their hearts. Thank you so much, Interfaith, not only for the free desserts, but for giving us so much encouragement that what we&#8217;re doing matters to people.</p>
<p><strong>WEEK 2: July 29th-August 4th </strong></p>
<p>As if this couldn&#8217;t get any more real, at the start of the second week, we had more than enough material to make a solid script. We organized them into different categories like &#8220;Diversity at Muhlenberg&#8221;, money, safety, allyship and activism, race, religion, and probably a dozen more. It was a little overwhelming at first, printing out all the material and physically seeing it in front of. We had A LOT of editing and organizing to do in order to make something truly special. So we started the &#8220;puzzle method&#8221; and cut out each line, laid them all down on the floor, and put them in conversation with each other to create our script, like putting together pieces of a puzzle. It is no easy take and it does not take one 4 hour rehearsal to get it all done, especially when it came to categories like allyship, race, and safety. The silver lining in this is that the people we interviewed are absolutely brilliant and have a lot of valid, important opinions. The fact that we have a hard time creating a 35 minute show from all of the material we have actually means that there are some really wonderful people on this campus.</p>
<p>Special shout out to Jon Diaz, who gave us ice cream from the Multi freezer on night one. We love you!</p>
<p>Another one of the things that makes this year&#8217;s project unlike any before is that we now officially have an Instagram account! If you have  Instagram, give us a follow @SedehiDiversityProject2018 for daily updates on our feed and on our story! It&#8217;s one of the easiest ways to keep track with our process.</p>
<p>Now, without further ado, here is our very first vlog video capturing Weeks 1 and 2!</p>
