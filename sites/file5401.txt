								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Throughout the interview-reviewing process, I’ve noticed that the conversation about diversity at Muhlenberg often centers on critiques of Muhlenberg’s performance as a “progressive”, like-minded liberal arts institution. Commonly known amongst students and staff alike as “The Caring College,” the community at Muhlenberg has begun to acknowledge this performance of Niceness as its own school-specific type- “Muhlenberg Nice”- that paints the community at Muhlenberg as a happy, welcoming, accepting place for all, where the red doors are always held open for you and everyone Cares. After going through this first round of interviews, however, I’ve been asking myself, really- who do we, as a community at Muhlenberg, actually Care about? The statistics seem to speak differently than the perfectly painted picture of diversity that many at Muhlenberg would like to be true. White bodies, as well as predominantly cisgender and heterosexual identifying individuals, dominate the student body and faculty. This narrative of Niceness has been adopted by these privileged bodies in our community at Muhlenberg (the majoritarian identities). In Muhlenberg’s performance as Nice, the marginalized identities of the community are inherently silenced, as their struggles and experiences are seen as disturbances to the peaceful, kind, and Caring atmosphere of Muhlenberg’s campus. All too often, acknowledgments of systemic inequality are seen as an outside problem, not a Muhlenberg Problem- as if Muhlenberg is not a microcosm of the world, operating underneath the same power structures and abiding by the same hierarchies.</p>
<p>The Town Hall meeting in November of the past year is a clear and concise example of what I mean when I say that marginalized bodies are at risk of disrupting the harmony that persists around Muhlenberg Nice. In showing their solidarity with racial injustices at universities and colleges nationwide, students of color at Muhlenberg took to the popular, anonymous social media app, Yik Yak, to express their experiences at a predominantly white institution with the hashtags #Blackoncampus and #Latinxoncampus. This movement was met with harsh resistance on Yik Yak- a place where Muhlenberg Nice doesn&#8217;t have to exist, because of its anonymity. By addressing their own nuanced experiences of what it means to be a marginalized body in a majoritarian space, these students of color were met with direct, horrendous racist commentary from the surrounding community.</p>
<p>The sentiment that Muhlenberg exists in a vacuum, or what students attribute to the concept of the MuhlenBubble, does not exempt it from functioning under the same rules as the macro-level power structures surrounding it. It’s Nice to think of Muhlenberg as Caring, but I think it’s important to continue asking the questions- how much do we, at Muhlenberg, <em>really</em> Care? Is it enough that we hold the red door for everyone when it’s clear that “everyone” is a specific type of person, a tailored combination of identities?</p>
