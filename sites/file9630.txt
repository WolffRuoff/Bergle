Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas. State-sanctioned segregation of public schools was a violation of the 14th Amendment and was therefore unconstitutional. This historic decision marked the end of the &#8220;separate but equal&#8221; precedent set by the Supreme Court nearly 60 years earlier and served as a catalyst for the expanding civil rights movement during the decade of the 1950s.&#8221; Read more at http:\/\/www.archives.gov\/education\/lessons\/brown-v-board\/<\/p>\n<p>The following selected resources showcase a variety of primary sources related to Brown v.
