The library sessions, in particular, provide students with hands-on opportunities to gain and sharpen important literacy skills, including (1) how to determine the type of information needed, (2) how to effectively retrieve such information, (3) how to critically evaluate different types of information, and (4) how to apply information to a specific research task. By strengthening information literacy skills, students not only become stronger psychology students, but they are able to more effectively appreciate psychology&#8217;s role in a liberal arts education.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>Resources for Nov. 15 Center for Ethics Event<\/strong><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Find\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.muhlenberg.edu\/library\/guides\/libinst\/ethics\/market_values\/chocolate.html\">here<\/a>\u00a0library resources to assist with discussions about the film Nothing Like Chocolate.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>Copyright FAQ<\/strong><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Scuttlebutt has compiled some of the most frequently asked questions regarding copyright in the classroom:<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<blockquote><p><em>Can I distribute photocopies of articles in my classroom, or post those articles to Blackboard?<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Fair Use allows you to make photocopies to distribute to students in the classroom, and\/or post to Blackboard or Moodle (secured sites). The only limitation is that you don&#8217;t exceed 10 percent of a book, or more than one journal article from a single issue of a journal. In that event, contact Jonathan Macasevich at the library reserves office, and he&#8217;ll attempt to secure permission for you to exceed that amount. The library has some funding to pay modest copyright fees.<\/p>\n<p><em>Can I copy from textbooks and distribute to my students?<br \/>\n<\/em><br \/>\nTextbooks are a sensitive area. It is important to abide by the 10 percent rule here, as copying from textbooks directly impacts the educational market for these books. If you wish to exceed 10 percent of the total, submit a request to Jonathan Macasevich (jmacasevich@muhlenberg.edu) in the library reserves office. He can explore how much it would cost to secure permission from the publisher for you to copy more than 10 percent of the work to distribute to your students. It&#8217;s worth our asking, especially if the amount is small in relation to the whole of the work. The permissions fees can be modest.<\/p>\n<p>The other option, of course, would be to ask the students to purchase the book.<\/p>\n<p>What about if I want students to read chapters from a book, but am not requiring that they photocopy those pages?<\/p>\n<p>As for students reading a book, and not necessarily asking them to copy it, placing the book on hard-copy library reserves is a good option.<\/p>\n<p><em>Who can I contact on campus with copyright questions?<\/em><\/p>\n<p>If you have any questions or concerns regarding copyright compliance, feel free to email the Scholarly Communication Librarian at kcannon@muhlenberg.edu.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>Infomaniac<\/strong><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><em><strong>Syncing Zotero<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p>Do you or your students use the fabulous and free Zotero to store, sort, and cite references for research papers or other projects?
