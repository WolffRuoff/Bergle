								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wednesday, July 31st &#8212; Day 3</p>
<p>Oh what a night!</p>
<p>It starts with us attempting to navigate our way through Allentown towards <em>Spice India</em>, a relatively local and authentic Indian restaurant. Ultimately the lesson from that experience was: how many college students does it take to read a GPS? Far too many.</p>
<p>Once at the restaurant we enjoyed some delicious Indian cuisine but the real fun came when the check arrived. The first time we attempted to split the check we didn&#8217;t obtain enough money (around $30 under), the second attempt resulted in far too much money in the pile (around $15 over), the third time was the charm luckily&#8230;.but pathetically. The whole ordeal took about 15 minutes or so and you would think with two math majors in the group we would have been more successful. Lesson from that experience: Next time, split the check.</p>
<p>Rehearsal was by large a success as we went through seven transcripts. By this I mean we went through the transcriptions of seven interviews and chose/debated over what transcribed portions we wanted in the script and took out the parts we did not.</p>
<p>Although I was surprised about the general lack of heated debates over keeping some of them, I have feeling that this is only the beginning and I am actually looking forward to these arguments. Great, constructive arguments can only lead to a better product and I am so excited to see what we have by the end of all of this.</p>
