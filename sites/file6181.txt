<p>Recently we had our annual Mr. Muhlenberg Contest. It is a really fun event that we have every spring! Its a community-wide event where male students compete for the crown. There are different events like introduction, swimsuit, talent, etc. The contest is judged my Muhlenberg professors and staff. The event was packed with students, staff, and professors. It is such a great event that represents our Muhlenberg spirit! The whole event is essentially one big comedy show! Check out this picture of the winner Jeffrey Robb:</p>

<p>Muhlenberg students have a long weekend because of Easter, so right now I am sitting in my bed at home. I head back to school tomorrow and classes resume on Tuesday. It was really nice to be home for a couple of days. I dragged my family to see the movie &#8220;Admission&#8221;, a movie with Tina Fey and Paul Rudd. It was hilarious! I thought it was worth seeing, but it was probably more of a good rental. Earlier, I went out for frozen yogurt with my brother. If you have followed my other blog posts, you may have noticed I am a HUGE fan of frozen yogurt. So we went to try this new place close by. Due to construction, we had to enter through this sketchy alley way. Check it out in here:</p>

<p>Turns out, once we got inside, it was so yummy!!! I will be making many visits to &#8220;Sweet Luna&#8221; in the future. I approve.</p>
