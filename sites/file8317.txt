					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I personally have never used Uber.  However, I might definitely have to consider using it after reading this. As someone who lives about a half an hour from New York, I can definitely say that you make a valid point in writing that empty cabs are scarce. I have used the subway in the past, but Uber could very well be more convenient than looking for a subway station or tracking down an empty cab. I know people that swear by Uber and your post reinforces much of what they have to say about it. I will definitely have to reconsider my mode of transportation the next time I visit New York.&lt;/p&gt;
