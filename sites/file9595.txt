Unused titles have been removed and others are now available online (here are a few\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.muhlenberg.edu\/library\/more\/reference_databases.html\">prime examples<\/a>). You may have noticed the print collection has shrunk significantly. Likewise, the print Periodicals Collection continues to shrink as we transfer subscriptions to online versions (via JSTOR and Muse, etc.). Rather than maintaining the two smaller print collections separately, this summer we will be interfiling them into the Main Collection of books. This means, for example, history reference books, history books, and history periodicals will be shelved together in one place in the library, maximizing browsability. The new combined Main Collection will have the same footprint as the 3 separate collections, spanning the 3 floors of the library.<\/p>\n<p>Although they will be interfiled with the circulating collection of books, Reference books and Periodicals will not circulate. Reference items will continue to be identified with &#8220;Ref.&#8221; in front of the Call Number. Periodicals will be assigned a Call Number and will be identified with &#8220;Per.&#8221; in front of the Call Number.<\/p>\n<p>As we combine the three collections, we will be shifting their locations physically and updating the library catalog. Some Reference Collection items have already been shifted to the Main Collection The library catalog now shows their location as &#8220;Main Collection (Ref.).&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>This project is scheduled for completion before Fall semester.<\/p>\n<p>Questions?

Our goal is to make this Google-searchable database as a complete a list of citations as possible. Please take a look if you haven&#8217;t already done so to see if all your scholarly publications appearing during your tenure at the College are listed here. Simply reply to this email with anything that needs changing or is missing.<\/p>\n<p>We are especially interested in publications that have come out over the last academic year. These will be added to the database, and also appear in this year&#8217;s Source Book.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>Infomaniac Tip<\/strong><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><em><strong>Exploring Liberal Arts and Online Learning<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p>A recent article from The Chronicle of Higher Education reports on Bryn Mawr College&#8217;s experimentation with online learning.<\/p>\n<p>From the article:<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Bryn Mawr won a $250,000 grant from Next Generation Learning Challenges this spring to explore how online courseware could fit into the close-knit liberal-arts experience. [&#8230;] The software gives individualized instruction in 12 subjects, using sophisticated tracking of skill development and offering instant feedback and help based on the student&#8217;s mastery of concepts. The idea is to use this to teach basic statistics, say, instead of using a professor&#8217;s lectures-and time-on the fundamentals. [&#8230;]<br \/>\n&#8216;We don&#8217;t see this grant as replacing our most precious product, which is student-faculty interaction and student-student interaction,&#8217; said Kimberly Cassidy, Bryn Mawr&#8217;s provost and a professor of psychology who is the principal investigator on the project. &#8216;We want professors in these courses, which are first- and second-year classes, talking about more sophisticated ideas with the students,&#8217; Ms. Cassidy added.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Read the full article at\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/chronicle.com\/blogs\/wiredcampus\/liberal-arts-colleges-venture-into-unlikely-territory-online-courses\/32029\">Liberal-Arts Colleges Venture Into Unlikely Territory: Online Courses<\/a>.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A Monthly Update 7\/1\/11 Moving the Reference and Periodicals Collections Over the past year, we have begun a major redevelopment of our Reference Collection.
