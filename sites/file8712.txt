								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">       When first starting to read Mike Hanski’s article, the first thing the reader sees is the title in big bold letters, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Want to Be a Better Writer? Read more</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">. Hanski’s persuasion is in full effect in the title. Throughout the article, he lists many different ways that reading can help boost the mind including bringing inspiration, gaining knowledge, and widening vocabulary. Reading gives people an upper edge not just in writing which it does improve greatly but in overall knowledge that you are able to bring to the table in all situations. Knowing more information in various topics will help you be able to engage with many different people from very different backgrounds. Reading more would be beneficial to anyone willing to put in the work. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">        As I first started reading Hanski’s article, I immediately was lured in by his title. I label myself as someone who just reads what he is assigned and does not do any reading for leisure aside from breaking news on my twitter feed and many different types of articles. Who does not want to become a better writer? I clearly do not read enough and this article persuaded me to start reading more than what I am just assigned in school. The influences of reading by itself told me that I should and have to read more. Overcoming stress, keeping the brain in shape while getting older, and broadening of my imagination. Going to a school where writing is very important puts a large emphasis on this article. I need to be a better writer in order to succeed and if I think I am good enough to stop improving, even Stephen King one of the most famous and best selling authors ever credits reading to his writing abilities. “If you don’t have time to read, you don&#8217;t have the time (or the tools) to write. Simple as that,” (P.1) Even Stephen King, a writer with as much ability as he has, reads more to gain inspiration and assist with his writing. Reading is so special because it can help us with so many things and not just writing. Although people may not want to read because it is not convenient or takes up too much time, the benefits are endless and absolutely worth the time it takes. </span></p>
