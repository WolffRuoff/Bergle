								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Halloween is one of the most anticipated &#8220;holidays&#8221; of the entire year. While few actually know the historical significance of the annual fall celebration, the societal expectation embraced by all is to to dress up. In fact, Halloween incites so much excitement here, that instead of partaking in costume festivities only on the 31st of October, students plan three outfits for the Thursday, Friday, and Saturday of the weekend. This phenomenon is actually not unique to this school, as I was made aware through various forms of social media that my friends around the country were doing the same.</p>
<p>Given the theatrical and artistic foundations of Muhlenberg, it is no surprise students compile both clever and sophisticated costumes. For example, I saw a variety of imitated animals, television stars, food items, and even pop cultural characters from decades ago (leave it to berg students to be extremely ironic with costumes).</p>
<p>Unfortunately for me, I could not go out on Thursday or Friday because I had a wrestling tournament on Saturday. However, the one night I did go out was amazing and adequately hyped. Let&#8217;s start the countdown until next year!</p>
<p>Til next time!<br />
