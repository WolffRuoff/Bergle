Team sign-up is until 10 minutes before show time (6 p.m.). We are running two rounds this year (6-6:45, 7-7:45), and teams (4-6 members) can sign up for either or both rounds. Of course signing up for both rounds greatly improves your chance to win any of many prizes donated by local businesses (Brew Works, etc.). To sign up, call x3500 or come in to the library main (circulation) desk anytime until 5:50 p.m. Again, 4-6 members are required for each team. Mixed teams are encouraged (faculty-student, student-family, staff-faculty, etc.).<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>Not to Be Missed: Mourning Art Exhibit and Talk, Oct. 31, 7:00 p.m.<\/strong><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The library is fortunate to be the location for a Center for Ethics event like no other. If you have not heard of mourning art before, or even if you have, now is the time to see pieces from arguably one of the best collections of mourning art, owned and curated by our own Pamela Moschini, Director of the Office of Disability Services. In particular, the pieces of hair art, created by women of leisure in the Victorian Era, are magnificently intricate and lovely in their own way. Scuttlebutt was amazed at first sight, and believes you will be too.<\/p>\n<p>Importantly, on\u00a0<strong>October 31 at 7 p.m.<\/strong>, an opening talk about the collection will be given by Pamela, and additional comments on Victorian mourning art will be shared by Erika Sutherland. Location: level A concourse and Muhlenberg Room, Trexler Library. The mourning art collection will remain on display through mid-November. Open to the public.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>Access to Morning Call in Light of Changes<\/strong><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Scuttlebutt has heard through the grapevine that the Allentown Morning Call will begin charging for access to their website. As a consequence, Trexler Library staff are looking into the possibility of a campus-wide subscription to the Call website. However, institutional access may not be offered by the publisher at this time.<\/p>\n<p>For the time being, Trexler Library offers several alternative points of access to the Morning Call:<\/p>\n<p>1. Hard copy, available at the Information Services Desk on level A of the library.<\/p>\n<p>2. Access through LexisNexis. Text, but no images. Searching capability, but no browsing.
