								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Andy Yen discusses the role of privacy in today’s technologically driven society and how it has become almost nonexistent. His Ted Talk entitled, <em>Think your email’s private? Think again.</em> focuses on the matter of email and how many people are blind to the fact that all emails are visible to the public. Everything on the internet creates data, and what’s alarming is the notion that, “our data now lasts forever, so your data can and will outlive you.” (Yen, 2014) Data not only reveals personal information about us, but also indicates who we interact with, where we are, and what we think about. This summation of data open to the public officially deteriorates the concept of privacy, for the new generation of digital natives are taught to share everything about themselves online.</p>
<p>With regard to email, Yen makes an interesting comparison to postcards. He discusses how emails are not private and are the equivalent of sending a postcard, since, “everybody that sees it from the time it leaves your computer to when it gets to the recipient can actually read the entire contents.” (Yen, 2014) This observation is alarming because if the entire internet can read your emails, the comparison to text messaging must be analogous. Invasion of privacy has become such an integral part of this digital generation that it raises the fear of becoming a new social norm. The uses of this bank of information and data is endless. The government is the obvious thought that comes to mind when posing the question of, “Who’s listening or watching on the other end?” Next comes big businesses and all of their marketing tactics to sell personalized products to us, however, besides the government and big business, who else has an interest in our lives? It’s an important question to ask ourselves when choosing what we post online.</p>
<p>Yen proposes a way to secure our information to prevent the public from gaining access to our emails. The solution that already exists is called encryption, however common people do not have the skillset to execute that process. What Andy and his team of scientists developed is an app entitled ProtonMail. Created in the cafeteria of the European Organization for Nuclear Research, CERN, ProtonMail enables the average person to send automatically encrypted emails without the, “server being able to read what’s going on”, or the user seeing the encryption. To the users, they are emailing their friends and family as normal, however the emails are not open to the public to read or save as data. It is quite genius how Andy and his team made the extremely complicated process of encryption into an easy app that allows individuals to ensure their privacy and live without the eyes of the public watching their every move.</p>
<p>ProtonMail is beneficial because privacy has become a foreign concept in this digital age. This app makes privacy an option for the average person who otherwise would not know or understand how to encrypt his/her emails. Andy’s activism towards privacy reform is inspiring and significant to the movement because he emphasizes how if, “we want to have privacy online, what we have to do is we’ve got to go out and get it ourselves.” (Yen, 2014) It’s an absurd concept, the act of fighting for our privacy. Privacy should be a basic human right, for I thought it was very clearly protected in the Fourth Amendment. However, through manipulation and corruption within the marketing industry and federal government, people have found loopholes to gain access to our entire lives which have now essentially been posted online. The lack of privacy in this world is a, “global issue that impacts all of us&#8230;We have to build an Internet where privacy is no longer just an option, but is also the default.” (Yen, 2014) Through people like Andy, the fight for privacy is gaining extensive support. It has surpassed just the development of new technological innovations and has become a fierce confrontation with the oppression of human rights.</p>
