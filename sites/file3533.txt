And why should they when the DVR makes it so easy to avoid them?  But the Turner Company, a cable unit owned by the media conglomerate Time Warner, is developing a new strategy to save commercials from falling to their death (ouch!).  The company has undergone a four year effort to create a new kind of advertising strategy that will offer advertisers on the cable networks TBX, TNT, and True something that many others do not: a strong link between the commercial and the TV show that the consumers are viewing. The goal of this effort is to bring consumers back to commercials by making these ads relevant to the specific program and the specific audience.</p>
<p>Turner’s idea is similar to a technique that other networks have come up with, the technique of embedding show content within the commercial breaks.  We saw American Idol trying out this strategy with their “embedded auditions” that ran between commercials.  Networks and advertisers hoped that when viewers saw a flash of that familiar American Idol logo, they would stop fast-forwarding to see the show content, and, with any luck, see some other ads in the process.<span id="more-1155"></span></p>
<p>But the Turner Company’s strategy is a little different: instead of embedding show content into commercial breaks, the company proposes that advertisers work with Turner to create commercials that look or feel like a particular TV program, even though these spots are not actual show content.  The first step in this strategy is to identify particular moments or themes from the TV show that would seem to resonate with audiences or that serve as clear representations of the program.  The Turner Company uses the phrase “tagging” to describe the specific moments or themes that can be integrated into the commercials that will be viewed when the movie or television series is airing. Tuner Company’s thinking behind this tactic is that if the audience watches the television show or series, they must enjoy these themes or moments; therefore if these “tagged” themes are integrated into the commercials when the particular show or series is airing, consumers will be more likely to enjoy and watch the commercials.  So, if this strategy catches on, a company might develop an ad that features an attractive blonde singing in front of a panel of three (probably multi-racial/gender) judges to air during American Idol—it may not be an actual American Idol audition, but it looks like one, so audiences may be more inclined to watch the commercial.</p>
<p>Turner Company has hired several new employees to “tag” specific moments and themes in television series in the hopes of revamping television commercials. An inside source estimates that this new endeavor will cost Turner about a seven-figure sum amount. Linda Yaccarino, Vice President of Turner Entertainment ad sales states, “Such moves are absolutely critical to survival.”  This situation speaks to the enormous power of the client power role, or advertisers.   Turner, a cable distributor, is desperate to make TV attractive for advertisers, as cable networks rely largely on advertisers to make a profit.   As more and more consumers turn to online forms of media, television networks have to compete for advertiser dollars.  We have seen how this has impacted the print industries, which have either faltered or have been forced to go digital as a result of audience erosion and the resulting loss of advertisers.  The Turner Company does not want to suffer the same fate, so it is actively developing new ways to make its TV networks the hot place to advertise.  Plus, this new technique reflects the trend of audience segmentation: advertisers have always chosen to advertise during programs that draw an audience that would be interested in their products, but now there is even more of an opportunity to target an audience through an ad that is tailor-made for a specific audience.</p>
<p>It’s always a little troubling when the line between content creation and advertising gets blurred.  Turner’s mission is to help create commercials that complement television content, but it’s not a stretch to say that this relationship could become reciprocal with television creators creating content that complements commercials.  Or, television creators might be encouraged to dumb down their content so that it will be easier for advertisers to recycle this content in the form of an ad.</p>
<p>But with the incredible commercial zapping capability of DVRs, will the audiences even notice the change in commercials? Yaccarino is hopeful, stating, “A viewer could be ‘zooming through’ with a DVR, but if the advertising looks like the content the viewer tuned in to see in the first place, they may be trained to stop and watch it.” What are we dogs? We will see.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: small;font-family: Calibri">Rubino L., (2011, April 5). Lexus, KitchenAid, Chase Sapphire To Sponsor Bravo’s ‘Top Chef Masters.’ Broadcasting and Cable, Retrieved from <a href="//www.broadcastingcable.com/article/466349-Lexus_KitchenAid_Chase_Sapphire_To_Sponsor_Bravo_s_Top_Chef_Masters_.php">http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/466349-Lexus_KitchenAid_Chase_Sapphire_To_Sponsor_Bravo_s_Top_Chef_Masters_.php</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;font-family: Calibri">The third season of <em>Top Chef Masters</em> gains new sponsors. Bravo has announced Lexus, KitchenAid, and Chase Sapphire will donate a total of 250,000 to various charities throughout the season. Along with donating to charities these prestigious companies will have a plethora of in-show product integration including equipment used by contestants and the cars that drive them each episode. Not only will these products be used on the show, the companies will give out prizes to the chefs who win challenges, the grand prize of $100,000 to the show’s winner, and prizes to on line fans who compete in games through the Bravo TV website. Aside from these three major companies Bravo has made a deal with <em>New York</em> magazine to feature a <em>Top Chef Masters</em> exclusive section on its website.<span id="more-1090"></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;font-family: Calibri"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small"><span style="font-family: Calibri">These partnerships provide a bevy of advertising opportunities that are not just limited to commercials. With the increase of on line and DVR viewership networks like Bravo have to increasingly become more creative in the way they highlight their sponsors. Bravo uses the internet as a linking pin between its fans and the show by providing not only the television content but also interactive games and contests. Advertisers see this as another way to market their products to not only people watching the show, but people using the internet. Not only are these big money corporations trying to sell a product, they are working hard to exude a good public image; through their multiple donations throughout the season they will be extending their services to more than just fans and competitors. KitchenAid and Lexus not only fill the investor power role but also serve as an auxiliary role for Bravo and <em>Top Chef Masters</em>. This is beneficial for the show because not only do they gain much needed sponsorship funds, they also are saving money by having their advertisers fit the Top Chef kitchens with everything a gourmet chef could dream of. With the shows increased popularity Bravo has stepped up their game, moving on from their former Toyota sponsorship and on to a luxury brand like Lexus.  </span></span></p>

<p>The future of television viewing is here and the battle of cable providers versus networks is on.  Time Warner Cable recently developed an app for the iPad that delivers 17 live TV channels to iPad users via a cable modem.  Another cable distributor, Cablevision, is also developing an app that will deliver live TV to the iPad.  Finally, Dish Network provides a live feed to personal media devices, including the Ipad, through its Sling box service.  Why this shift in cable distribution?  Cable companies are adjusting to the reality that TV is not just watched on television sets anymore: the traditional TV competes with other technologies such as computers and phones. These companies want to distribute TV to all of these technologies rather than watching the television networks sell their rights to competing distributors or directly to the consumers.<span id="more-1070"></span></p>
<p>However, owners of cable networks, including Viacom, Scripps, and Discovery, claim that this type of television distribution requires additional rights to content, and Time Warner Cable, Cablevision and others will have to negotiate for these rights.   Scripps Network went public with its resistance saying it “has not granted iPad streaming rights to any distributor and is actively addressing any misunderstandings on this issue.” The networks’ central argument is that the rights should be sold for an additional premium. They also argue that the content is being delivered through a wireless broadband network and, while ads are shown in the stream, Nielsen isn’t yet able to measure them, which in turn means the networks can’t make money through advertising. Furthermore, networks have appealed to the authority power role, arguing that if the iPad is just another TV, then it should abide by the FCC laws, which would require them to carry broadcast channels required by the regulators.</p>
<p>This is an example of how a new technology can create tension between producer and distributor.   The distributor, the cable companies, doesn’t want to be left behind, so it has little choice but to change its business practices to include newly emerging technologies like the iPad.  However, the networks want to make sure that they get maximum money for their content, so they can hardly allow cable companies to stream TV shows to the iPad without forcing the companies to pay for this right.  The cable distributors are wise to be adaptive to technological changes and to take advantage of their access to TV viewers, one of their most valuable resources. But, just as we saw with Hulu, the networks control television content and, thus, have some power over distributors.</p>
<p>It is a very interesting time for the television industry since the traditional way of watching television programs is changing. Viewers have more options than ever, including Hulu and YouTube, as well as using other technologies like the iPad.   As the consumption of television through alternative screens become more popular, we are also likely to see more structural regulation from the FCC as TV producers and distributors make changes to adjust to the changing face of television.  The authority power role is very important in determining how media can be made and presented, and crucially, how the money gets distributed. As the new technology develops, the regulations will soon to follow. It is interesting and exciting that we get to see what happens next!</p>

<p>Albiniak.P (2011 March 14) Selling the Glee: Twentieth Television turns its attention to pitching its hit to stations for 2013 <em>Broadcasting and Cable </em>retrived from:<a href="http://0-web.ebscohost.com.library.muhlenberg.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=01ff61a1-db46-49b8-b3ca-e777fb23c69a%40sessionmgr10&amp;vid=7&amp;hid=15">http://0-web.ebscohost.com.library.muhlenberg.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=01ff61a1-db46-49b8-b3ca-e777fb23c69a%40sessionmgr10&amp;vid=7&amp;hid=15</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whether it’s on magazine covers or red carpet shows, the stars of Glee seem to be everywhere.  But Twentieth Television, which produces Glee, has plans to make the show even more ubiquitous.  Glee’s original episodes air on the Fox network, which makes sense as both Twentieth Television and Fox are owned by News Corps—both producer and distributor are owned by the same media conglomerate.   However, last summer, Twentieth Television sold syndication rights of Glee to Oxygen, a network owned by NBC Universal, which falls under the Comcast umbrella.  Here we see one television distributor making a deal with another one—a deal that has proved beneficial for NBC Universal’s Oxygen, which earned a record 4.4 million viewers during a weekend of Glee re-runs (a “Gleekend”).<span id="more-1032"></span></p>
<p>But Twentieth Television’s plans for Glee don&#8217;t stop there.   Twentieth’s mission is to get the rest of the country on board the “Glee train.” The television producer is seeking to sell syndication rights to television stations, both Fox affiliates and independent stations,across the country. This represents an attempt to go directly to exhibitors,many of whom have hours that need to be filled with content.  Glee re-runs could be a very viable option for these stations: the show’s audience is predominately female, and, crucially, predominately affluent.  This is the kind of audience that advertisers, or clients, are willing spend a lot of money on, as this demographic has a lot of buying power. Plus, Glee has proven to be a ratings smash, with both new episodes and re-runs earning large audiences, so acquiring the rights to air Glee could be financially smart for the exhibitors that are given the opportunity to grab a slice of the Glee pie.</p>
<p>As if that wasn’t enough, there is a spin-off reality show in the works. This summer, Oxygen will air The Glee Project, a reality show in which contestants will compete for a spot on Glee.  This program is yet another example of Glee’s already-abundant examples of linking pin activities, including CDs and music downloads featuring the songs head on the show.</p>

<p>Remember getting up early on Saturda<img class="alignleft" src="http://www.flowersbyvalerie.com/images/FBVED007.jpg" alt="" width="144" height="122" />y mornings to watch cartoons?  You undoubtedly remember such classics as <em>Recess </em>and <em>Pepper Ann</em>, but you probably also remember those bright, flashy advertisements for products like Gushers, Dunkaroos, and Kraft Mac and Cheese.  However, there have been some changes regarding food and drink advertising aimed towards kids.  After years of scrutiny from the FCC, 17 advertisers, including Burger King and Kraft, have not only improved the health content of their products, but have also changed their marketing strategies.  This agreement is called the Children’s Food and Beverage Advertising Initiative and is a creation of the Council of Better Business Bureaus.  In 2007, these advertisers pledged to promote healthy products in at least half of their media targeted to children.  In January 2010, promoting healthy products during kids’ ad times became an official requirement for businesses that are part of the Council of Better Business Bureaus.  Furthermore, major junk-food companies like Coca-Cola and Hershey have made it their policy to not advertise to children under the age of twelve.</p>
<p><span id="more-980"></span></p>
<p>Why would these companies volunteer to cut down its advertisers to its most eager customers?  It’s probably not because they’re worried about the dental hygiene of America’s youth.  More likely, it’s because these food companies want to avoid government regulation.  If these companies change their programming strategies, they can keep the FCC, playing the authority power role, from imposing its own rules.</p>
<p>We should also consider the role of the Council of Better Business Bureaus, the committee responsible for establishing these new protocols for kids’ food and drink advertising.  Though the BBB theoretically functions as a facilitator that encourages upright business practices and tells consumers which businesses are operating fairly, many have questioned the BBB’s cozy relationship with the very companies that it is supposed to be monitoring.  As businesses pay to be part of the BBB, the council has a strong interest in keeping these businesses happy. If the BBB comes out with strong criticisms against a powerful business, this business could stop participating in the BBB, taking with it its crucial resource: money.  Therefore, it seems unlikely that the BBB was interested in looking out for the health of young TV fans, and more likely that it was trying to assist the businesses that it depends on for its own survival.  For more on the questionable BBB practices, check out this <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2009/jan/21/business/fi-lazarus21">LA Times article</a>.</p>
<p>Another strategy that food and drink companies have taken to avoid FCC regulations is to shift the target of the advertisements from kids to their parents.  Daytime broadcast programming has benefitted from this shift, as advertisers know that this is when some parents (including stay at home moms) watch TV.  Additionally, these advertisers have become more interested in the traditional primetime hours (especially 8pm) as this is a time when both parents and kids watch TV together.  Now more than ever, advertisers are willing to pay a lot for these times slots, which, in turn, encourages the networks to expand their family friendly primetime programming.  This is an example of the advertiser’s, or client’s, ability to influence the types of shows that networks, or producers, create and air.</p>
<p>This example shows the lengths that TV advertisers will go to in order to avoid government regulation.  By making some concessions and shifting their target audience, America’s food and drink companies can both evade strict government rules, and, at the same time, continue to create new generations of French fry fiends and soda slurpers.</p>

Retrieved from <a href="http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/463937-Spencer_Levy_to_Head_MTV_s_Scripted_Development.php" target="_blank">http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/463937-Spencer_Levy_to_Head_MTV_s_Scripted_Development.php</a></p>
<p>MTV’s scripted series recently appointed new leadership. The Network’s president or Programming David Janollari named Clay Spencer and Justin Levy the new heads. Janollari said that their combined experience makes them the perfect team to work together. Levy has worked on MTV scripted series before while Spencer is new to the network. Spencer’s diverse television career has had a successful track record; working on networks like The WB and an independent production company. Janollari and him have worked together before. Just like in the publishing world MTV is sticking to who has been successful. In demanding times for television it would not be wise to hire some brand new writer no one has heard of even if he or she looks to have good work. Janollari is hiring who he knows and who he thinks he can get good results from.</p>
<p><span id="more-900"></span></p>
<p>With MTV’s recent scandal in regards to their highly controversial series <em>Skins</em>, maybe it was time to get new management in the scripted sector of this network. Levy has already proven successful during his previous time and an MTV executive where he “spearheaded such scripted efforts as <em>The Hard Times of RJ Berger, Teen Wolf</em>, and <em>This is Awkward.” </em>Prior to MTV Levy worked as a director of NBC’s primetime series development. Working for NBC is a good credential to have under your belt and MTV recognized that.By filling the creator power role of their organization with an experienced writer, they not only help create a better product, but at the same allocate more power to Levy than they would with a lesser known producer.With the network’s new leaders for their scripted series maybe MTV’s scripted shows will be able to beat out the great rating of their reality shows like <em>Jersey Shore</em> for example. The power of using what you already know to be good cannot be underestimated.</p>

<p>As busy college students, many of us find it difficult to sit down to watch our favorite shows when they originally air. That’s what makes a website like <a href="http://www.hulu.com/">Hulu</a> so convenient—this online television option makes it easy to catch up on <em>Glee</em> or <em>The Office</em> in between classes (or parties).  Also attractive to college students is the fact that Hulu is free, as the site earns its money from advertisers rather than from users.  While Hulu is fantastic for busy TV fans, it is not necessarily ideal for television networks—while the networks are given a share of Hulu’s advertising revenue, some have deemed this percentage inadequate (check out this <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/03/business/media/03hulu.html?scp=1&amp;sq=hulu%20and%20comedy%20central&amp;st=Search"><em>New York Times</em> article</a>, which describes Comedy Central’s grievances with and temporary departure from Hulu).   Adding to the industry’s woes is the difficulty of measuring ratings from Hulu, which is also tied to profits, as networks use ratings as a resource to lure advertisers.  This dilemma was the topic of this &#8220;State of the TV Industry&#8221; panel at the February 15th TV Summit, an event hosted by the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences Foundation and <em>Variety</em>.</p>
<p><span id="more-892"></span></p>
<p>Television distribution has become extremely fragmented, providing audiences with a choice of where and how to watch TV shows.  Much like Tivo, a site like Hulu acts as a distributor that, in many ways, empowers audiences:  viewers aren’t bound to network-determined schedules and can watch their favorite shows when they want, free of charge.  The television industry’s effort to monetize this online content, a goal expressed by several members of the “State of the TV Industry” panel, creates a bit of a power struggle between audience and producer, with the distributor, Hulu, in the position of middleman with the ability to direct the flow of power.   However, the networks have some muscle when dealing with Hulu as they control a resource that is absolutely crucial to Hulu’s operation: content.  If a network is not satisfied with Hulu’s method of compensation, the network can simply withdraw its content from the site, which could cost Hulu viewers, and, as a result, money from advertisers.  Taking this power structure into consideration, we anticipate that Hulu will eventually shift into a completely subscription-based system (the site did recently add a premium option, <a href="http://www.hulu.com/plus">Hulu Plus</a>, which cost users $7.99 a month) in order to boost the percentage of its profits that it directs to the participating networks, which will ensure that these networks continue to provide Hulu with the content the site needs to hold onto audiences.</p>
<p>While much of the TV Summit discussion centered on the necessity of making a profit from online content, some panelists were more concerned with the quality of the content itself, with some industry insiders emphasizing the importance of inspired writers and emotionally-gripping story lines.  But when it comes to the issue of monetizing online television, it will be producers and investors, rather than TV writers or creators, who will exercise the most influence over this technological and financial issue.  However, if the networks’ monetization dreams do come true, audiences will, hopefully, demand top-notch quality if we’re asked to pay top-dollar to watch TV online.</p>

LX New York is Alive at Five. <em>Broadcasting &amp; Cable, (141,5).</em> Retrieved from <a href="http://0-web.ebscohost.com.library.muhlenberg.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?hid=8&amp;sid=f5b72ee7-0ab7-4b24-879e-1f00d0d749ae%40sessionmgr11&amp;vid=4" target="_blank">http://0-web.ebscohost.com.library.muhlenberg.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?hid=8&amp;sid=f5b72ee7-0ab7-4b24-879e-1f00d0d749ae%40sessionmgr11&amp;vid=4</a></p>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://assets.nydailynews.com/img/2010/04/06/alg_lx_new_york2.jpg" alt="" width="257" height="176" /></p>
<p>Hoping to interest a new target audience, WMBC New York executives created the 60-minute news program <em>LX New York</em>, which airs daily at 5:00 pm. At first, ratings were less than impressive. As a result, the creators decided to implement some key changes to the show&#8217;s format. These changes were linked to another decision: WMBC executives decided to specifically target suburban women.  To increase show ratings and appeal to these viewers, <em>LX New York</em> started utilizing the city more.  For example, the show began airing cooking segments filmed on the city streets and in local restaurants instead of in the studio. The new and improved <em>LX New York</em> also features celebrity interviews, cooking segments,news snippets, and a topic of the day.</p>
<p><span id="more-823"></span>Additionally, executives brought on a new host, former news anchor Jane Hanson.  By serving as a familiar face, Hanson comes with her own fans, thus, brings more viewers to<em> LX New York</em>.  Producers also created a social media campaign, which included an online, live viewer chat about the show. Specifically, the online resources and viewer chats act as a linking pin for <em>LX New York</em>, an example of a symbiotic relationship between television and internet. Most importantly,the live chats provide a sense of community for fans, forming personal ties and relationship to the show while also providing feedback to producers.  That way, both audiences and producers benefit and gain a sense of power.<br />
<!--more--><br />
However, WMCS and viewers are not the only parties benefitting from the revamped <em>LX New York</em>.  A unique way the show presents its advertisers is through integration into segments, which would not be done in a newscast. For instance, the grocery store chain, Fairway, has sponsored cooking bits. This unique kind of advertising is enticing for advertisers since the product is actually integrated into the program, as opposed to using commercials, which can be bypassed.  This is especially relevant in the age of changing television exhibition, with technologies such as Tivo allowing viewers to simply fast-forward through commercials.</p>
<p>Competitors are thrilled with WMBC’s New York’s change because the new program does not target a news audience anymore, even though it is running during a timeslot traditionally reserved for news programs.  Of course, if the show does too well, it could spawn imitators, which could lead to the replacement of serious news with soft entertainment—a potentially dangerous transition for a democratic society that relies on an informed citizenry.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Morabito, Andrea. (2011, Feb. 7). <em>Broadcasting &amp; Cable. </em>Retrieved from <a href="http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/463581-Super_Bowl_XLV_is_Most_Watched_TV_Program_Ever.php" target="_blank">http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/463581-Super_Bowl_XLV_is_Most_Watched_TV_Program_Ever.php</a>.</p>
<p>Super Bowl XLV last Sunday February 6, was the most watched television show in U.S. history. The game averaged 111 million total views. This beat last year’s Super Bowl’s record of 106.5 million spectators. The Super Bowl always rakes in extreme high numbers of viewers and for the past four years has set a viewership records.</p>
<p>            After the Super Bowl, an episode of <em>Glee</em> aired from 10:30 to 11:45 p.m. 26.8 million people watched increasing its total viewers 17% from its weekly average.<em> Glee’s</em> numbers were bigger than the episode of <em>The Office</em> that followed 2009’s Super Bowl. However, last year’s post Super Bowl’s episode of <em>Undercover Boss</em> drew bigger numbers than both <em>Glee </em>and The <em>Office.<span id="more-769"></span></em></p>
<p>            We suspect that the broad audience of a reality television show would lure in more viewers than a musically based high school sitcom. This makes us think about the idea of public interest and why Fox chose such a special interest show that does not seem to fit the same audience as the Super Bowl. An event like the Super Bowl can unite all different ages and demographics showing the positive possibilities for television. When Fox chooses to show a program like <em>Glee</em>, we feel the network has other motives in mind besides the public interest. Were they trying to attract a broader audience to increase network’s long term viewership? Was Fox trying to piggy back off of the popularity of the Super Bowl to increase <em>Glee’s</em> fan base? While <em>Glee</em> has proved its success, we feel that a show like <em>Undercover Boss</em> which has a wider appeal may have been a better fit for the Super Bowl’s audience’s actual desires and interests. This brings us back to the power relationship between the network heads and the audience. Networks don’t necessarily have to give audiences what may be best but instead they focus on what may be most lucrative, ultimately choosing their rising star, <em>Glee</em>. While traditional all-American football fans may not always mix with musical theater lovers, with Fox has anything to say about it, they will.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lafayette, J.  (2011, February 1). MTV’s ‘Skins’ Continues Ratings Slide Except with Teens.  <em>Broadcasting &amp; Cable</em>. Retrieved from <a href="http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/463300-MTV_s_Skins_Continues_Ratings_Slide_Except_with_Teens.php">http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/463300-MTV_s_Skins_Continues_Ratings_Slide_Except_with_Teens.php</a>.</p>
<p>The new MTV show <em><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=skins+us+trailer&amp;aq=f">Skins</a>,</em> a program that depicts (quite explicitly) “the sex and drug habits of teens,” is already facing pressure from audiences and advertisers, even though the show has only aired three episodes.  Although MTV aims its programming towards the 12-34 year old demographic, <em>Skins</em> has been wildly popular with 12-17 year olds (omg!), which is troubling for many parents.  One major media advocacy organization, The Parents Television Council, labeled <em>Skins</em> the “’&#8217;most dangerous show&#8217; on TV for children.&#8221;  Even Viacom, which owns MTV, has acknowledged these concerns, suggesting the show may, in fact, violate child pornography laws.  This negative attention has also worried advertisers, many of whom have opted to remove their advertisements from MTV during <em>Skins&#8217; </em>time slot.</p>
<p><span id="more-731"></span>The outcry over <em>Skins</em> complicates that old media adage that sex sells.  <em>Skins</em>’ racy content has upset public advocacy groups, which have significant power to shape television programming.  While we often think of government regulation as the key way to address questionable media content, this example suggests that public advocacy organizations can also be effective by encouraging media producers to self-regulate.  As a public advocacy group, the PTC has the ability to draw negative attention to <em>Skins</em>, increasing the likelihood that other parents will think twice before allowing their own kids to watch the program.  Plus, networks know that if they fail to listen to advocacy groups&#8217; concerns, these groups can turn to the government to secure mandated content regulation.   These two resources, publicity and the threat of government-regulation, give advocacy groups like the PTC an edge when dealing with media producers like MTV, and could very well persuade MTV to dial back on <em>Skins</em>&#8216; adult content.</p>
<p>In addition to the PTC, many advertisers have also objected to<em> Skins</em>.  Not wanting to be associated with an increasingly stigmatized show, General Motors, Taco Bell, Schick, Subway, Wrigley, and H&amp;R Block have all removed their ads during <em>Skins</em>’ time slot.  Other sponsors who had secured product placement deals with MTV, including Clearasil, are also considering withdrawing their involvement with <em>Skins. </em>So, advertisers, which fill the power role of client, can also use their resources to motivate television networks to self-regulate their content.   When a client like Subway withdraws its ads from MTV during <em>Skins</em>&#8216; time slot, this is an example of a client exercising its power, or strategically withholding its resources.  As television networks rely on money from advertisers, MTV, again, has an interest in self-regulating its controversial material in order to hold onto advertisers and the money that they control.</p>
<p>Whether you think the uproar over <em>Skins</em> represents a move towards a sensible solution or senseless censorship, one thing’s for sure: the <strong>ombudspeople</strong> at MTV must be very busy.</p>
