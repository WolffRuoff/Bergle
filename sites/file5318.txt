								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This afternoon&#8217;s showing to RAs (Residential Advisors) and SAs (Student Advisors who lead groups of first years through Orientation Weekend) went beautifully. During the talkback afterward, a wonderful young man asked each member to explain why they wanted to be involved in SDP, and what they hoped each audience member would take away from the project. We ran out of time before all of us could answer, and so I am posting my response here:</p>
<p><strong>Why get involved with this?</strong></p>
<p>For those who don&#8217;t know me, I&#8217;m a white, straight, upper-middle class male. My only salient minority identity is the fact that I&#8217;m Jewish. So I have a enormous amount of privilege. My first year at Muhlenberg, I just sort of coasted by, absent in conversations on diversity, partially because I didn&#8217;t know they were there. But a lot of my friends were active in them. So I knew they existed, I just never thought that they had to do with me. I auditioned for the play going into sophomore year, and made it as an alternate that was never called upon.<br />
I wish I could pinpoint the moment where I realized how important this all was. I remember my mind exploding when I saw SDP as a first year, and I&#8217;d like to think that it had just been incubating since. But some point during sophomore year, I got involved. I started going to SQuAd meetings (Students for Queer Advocacy) and Muhlenberg&#8217;s Feminist Collective. I also interviewed and got into a group called Peer 2 Peer, which exists to facilitate conversations around diversity. I took a class on Gender and Sexuality in Judaism. I saw SDP my sophomore year. I saw the Vagina Monologues. I&#8217;ve had the fortune to be in a relationship with somebody who also cares about this stuff. I started my own blog (which I don&#8217;t think I can solicit here) so that I had a space to put all my ideas on these and other subjects. And somewhere inside this fire burned, this <em>need</em> to be active in these discussions.</p>
<p>I tried out again and made it. And it was one of the greatest experiences of my life.</p>
<p><strong>What do you hope people take away from it?</strong></p>
<p>As a white, straight, upper-middle class male, I came into these talks not knowing what to do with my privilege. The hope is that this project shows some ways to do that. But what I most want people to take away from this is that <strong><em>you</em> can be active in these discussions.</strong>  Yes, you reading this right now! All of you.You have power, the ability to change someone&#8217;s mind for the better. You won&#8217;t always be right, and you&#8217;ll make mistakes often. But that&#8217;s okay! Mistakes are fine as long as you learn from them. Go out there and engage with people! Challenge yourself! Fight for freedom for all people.</p>
