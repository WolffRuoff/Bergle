								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The development of mobile phones, specifically smartphones, has brought about the creation of numerous apps. Among some of today’s most widely used apps are group messaging apps. In particular, GroupMe, owned by Microsoft, has emerged as one of the most popular group messaging apps on the market. In fact, there are some who swear by GroupMe, claiming that it is the best mobile messaging app available. So, why are so many individuals of this mindset?</p>
<p>There are several reasons users prefer GroupMe to other mobile messaging apps. Among them are that GroupMe enables individuals to “select who is in the group and make it private,” provides members with an opportunity to “upload photos or videos like multimedia text messages,” and makes sure that a user’s “phone number remains private to the group” he/she is in (Ledesma, 2012, p.3). While author Paul Ledesma (2012, p.3) notes that GroupMe is primarily geared toward smartphones, he writes that its chats can also be accessed as SMS text messages. Additionally, GroupMe is extremely accommodating in that it allows users to simply request to increase the number of members in a group should it exceed the standard size of 25, works on every smartphone, and can be accessed via computers (Ledesma, 2012, p.3).</p>
<p>GroupMe is such a user-friendly app that Ledesma, the Director of Undergraduate Admission at the University of Southern California’s Viterbi School of Engineering, has decided to use it for several of his affairs. Prior to using GroupMe, Ledesma would prepare logistics sheets to work out details regarding locations, people, and duties for several events that were taking place on campus (Ledesma, 2012, p.2). The primary issue with these logistics sheets was that Ledesma often found that he and his crew would have to change “one last detail at the last minute” typically having to cancel or add a location (Ledesma, 2012, p. 2). In addition, Ledesma’s crew was heavily reliant on rented walkie talkies. Unfortunately, not everyone would receive a walkie talkie due to expenses and those who did receive them often needed to resort to call signs and CB talk “over and outs” (Ledesma, 2012, p.3). Thus, GroupMe provided the perfect solution.</p>
<p>With GroupMe Ledesma has been able to effectively communicate with his 25 student ambassadors, the professional admission staff, and the front desk staff (Ledesma, 2012, p. 3). The app is beneficial for both students and staff. The staff is not keen on giving out their phone numbers to all of the students and can avoid doing so by using GroupMe and students can disable their notifications if they are in class (Ledesma, 2012, p. 3).  The icing on the cake is that the inclusion of the front desk staff in the chat has given receptionists an opportunity to take calls on the phone and communicate with students and staff on the computer simultaneously (Ledesma, 2012, p. 4).</p>
<p>Furthermore, GroupMe has made mass communication significantly simpler. Ledesma’s case serves as a prime example and is certainly not an anomaly. GroupMe has gained notoriety with students, specifically those in high school and college. Students have found that GroupMe’s user-friendly interface has made it easy to create multiple chats. For instance, any given person may be in nine or ten chats. Four of these chats may be dedicated to friends, another three to classes, and the final three to family. Aforementioned chats are bundled into one app providing GroupMe users with immediate access to conversations between classmates, family, and friends. As a result, communication in today’s day in age could not be easier than it is with GroupMe.</p>
