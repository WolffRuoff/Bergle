				<div class="comment-body"><p>One of the truly great people to walk the earth.  I am so blessed to have been a player for coach in 1980.  I&#8217;ve spoken to several of my best friends and team mates already and we all share the same love and affection for coach.  He is a hero to me and to so many.  I have told him in the past and my kids that I hope my kids have the honor and priviledge of knowing such a great person.  I was also fortunate to see coach many times even after graduation.  Coach is family and always will be.</p>

				<div class="comment-body"><p>I met Frank in September of &#8217;85, I had just graduated from Susquehanna University and started working at Muhlenberg.  Frank wanted to be sure that I met his daughter Pam who also went to Susquehanna, and now, dear friend.  Frank always had a smile, and boy did he LOVE Muhlenberg!  Loving husband, Dad, Grandfather&#8230;and &#8220;Coach&#8221; to all.  My heart goes out to the family.</p>

				<div class="comment-body"><p>I cannot say enough about how this wonderful man&#8217;s influence helped give me direction in life.  I met Coach in 1964 and had the incredible fortune of playing football for 3 years for him in high school.   In 1967 he convinced me to go to Muhlenberg with him bypassing opportunities to play Div 1 football.  Though the early years at Berg were difficult I have never regretted the decision again having him as my head coach again in 1970.  I actually  followed in his footsteps after graduation and went back to our high school where we met and coached for the next 7 years.  Though my association with Coach was on the gridiron  what he taught me were actually invaluable lessons about life.  His influence has touched me and my entire family which includes my youngest daughter who is a senior at Berg.  To his wife, Carol, and his daughters I share in your loss.  Ted</p>

				<div class="comment-body"><p>I am incredibly saddened to hear the loss of this wonderful man.  Coach was the reason I attended Muhlenberg.  I had the privilege of playing for him on the 1990-1994 volleyball team.  When Coach created the 1990 team, he created a family.  We were all what he called his original &#8220;Buttermakers.&#8221;  He was a mentor to me, and guided me on and off the court.  He will truly be missed.  I extend my deepest sympathy and love to Mrs. Marino and their entire family.</p>

				<div class="comment-body"><p>My friendship with Frank was long and deep. When in 1972 I joined the Muhlenberg Public Relations/Sports Information staff as a twenty two year-old he helped me get acquainted with the college and its people.   Our Italian-American heritage and New York City roots gave us plenty to talk about, but nothing animated Frank more than talking about family and Muhlenberg.  How wonderful it was that he was still on campus a couple decades later as my own daughters walked the halls and lawns of ‘berg.  I can still here the excitement in their voices when they would call me to say ‘I saw Mr. Marino today on campus.”   It was an excitement we all felt when we last saw him at the recent Scotty Wood Tournament.  May Carroll, the girls and those wonderful grandchildren keep a smile in their hearts even in these difficult days.  May God bless our friend Frank!</p>

				<div class="comment-body"><p>I am extremely saddened by the news of Coach Marino&#8217;s passing. Having played both Football and LaCrosse for Coach in the early 70&#8217;s, he became my Pennsylvania dad as he was for so many of us.  I came back for a LaCrosse game during the opening season for the new Varsity program after many years away.  I was getting out of the car in the parking lot as Coach walked by and without hesitation he called out my name and number. He remembered us all as we will remember him.  He will surely be missed.</p>

For each of my reunions since graduating he was always the first faculty member named when we considered our class guests. I had the &#8220;misfortune&#8221; of having gym class with Coach the Monday after the Mules has lost to Swarthmore as they snapped their then longest losing streak in the nation. He greeted us with his typical good humor and assured us that the team would pick up the pieces and move on. I lost my dad earlier this year, I hope he and Coach become friends in heaven.</p>

				<div class="comment-body"><p>Frank Marino&#8217;s passing has left a huge void in our lives.  His genuine love and admiration for Muhlenberg and as a consequence, his tireless work toward a better Muhlenberg will never, ever be matched.  His accomplishments as a coach in numerous sports are legendary, but his greatness was really his love for people and his efforts to help guide them in their life&#8217;s work.  There are many fine people in the Muhlenberg alumni ranks, but Frank, a non-alumnus, outdistanced and outranked them all.  I don&#8217;t believe we will ever see a man of his stature and greatness again on the Muhlenberg campus.  </p>
<p>My wife Connie and my children (Christopher &#8217;89, Andrea &#8217;91, Alysia &#8217;92) join me in extending our deepest sympathies to Frank&#8217;s wonderful wife Carol and his daughters and grandchildren.</p>

A remarkable human being who always cared about you, your family, and his extended family of athletes. Coach had a remarkable memory for every play of every game. </p>
<p>His energy and encouragement were infectious. One didn&#8217;t have to see him but only hear him to know who was in the same room as you. He was always upbeat.</p>

				<div class="comment-body"><p>Our prayers and sympathies go out to the Marino and Muhlenberg Families.   I had the pleasure of playing volleyball under Coach.  He made every player feel valued and important with kind words, supportive stories, a motivating spirit and his humor.  Over the years I have thought about him often and the impact he had on a goofy freshman.  We will miss him.</p>

				<div class="comment-body"><p>Coach was a wonderful and kind man. It was a pleasure to work with him and to sit and talk with him.  He was so proud of &#8220;his boys&#8221; and told stories about his wonderful players and always remembered their families by name. His students were second only to his girls a home.  His face always lit up when talking about his daughters or his beautiful wife.  He was coach and teacher to all of us, even if we never played on one of his teams&#8230;and I am proud to have been his friend.</p>
<p>My sincere sympathy to Carroll and the entire family</p>

				<div class="comment-body"><p>Muhlengerg has lost one of its greatest spokesmen.  He was truly a great man.  I had never heard of Muhlenberg College until one winter day in 1967 he walked into one of my basketball games to introduce me to the College.  Even though he was the football coach he showed that his greatest concern was for the sporting life of the college, not just his self interests.  He was a very unselfish man and the gifts he left behind will be remembered forever.  Years after I graduated and I would return to the College he always made it a point to welcome me and we would relive old times.  When I think of Muhlengerg College one of the first things that comes to mind is Frank Marino.  He will be missed, but fondly remembered!!</p>

				<div class="comment-body"><p>Our hearts and prayers are with the Marino family. Frank was a true gentleman and class act in every aspect.  He embodied the spirt of Muhelnberg and lived the core values the college stands for.  As per the Muhlenberg mission statement, Frank was able to express ideas with clarity and grace, committed to life-long learning, equipped with ethical and civic values, and led a life committed to leadership and service. He was a friend, mentor, sincere and selfless person. Though a sad day, I beleive we can all reflect back and consider our selves very forutnate as it was an honor to know Frank and have him part of the Muhlenberg Community.  God Bless.</p>

				<div class="comment-body"><p>I had the unique honor of playing football under coach Marino in both HS (Morris Hills) and at Muhlenberg (1967) where Coach arrived after a very short but immensely successful career as the first Head Football Coach at the then new Morris Knolls HS. Upon his arrival at &#8216;Berg, Coach brought new life and a spark to the &#8216;Berg community, something which has carried through to today and will, in his memory, remain for many years to come.  As we alums returned to &#8216;Berg over the years, Coach always knew our names, showed genuine interest in our lives and helped revive old memories with his always energetic enthusiasm for &#8216;Berg and its &#8220;family.&#8221; He will be sorely missed and our sincerest condolences are extended to Carol and her family and the &#8216;Berg community in general.<br />

				<div class="comment-body"><p>My wife and I extend our deepest condolences to Carol and to the rest of the family on the passing of  Coach Marino.</p>
<p>I played football for Frank in the 1967 and 1968 seasons, and lacrosse in 1969.  In the ‘80’s I used to work out in the life sports center from time to time, and on several occasions I ran into Frank.  We jogged together, and he taught me how to jog as opposed to running.  “Slow down”, he said, “and the pounds will come off.”  He was right.  So he was still teaching me things more than a decade after I got out of school.</p>
<p>Frank Marino was the nicest guy I ever encountered in sports.</p>

				<div class="comment-body"><p>My earliest memories of Muhlenberg College are when my father would bring me to Muhlenberg to watch Frank Marino&#8217;s Mules back in the 70&#8217;s.  During my college search (which began and ended with Muhlenberg), during my tour of the campus, as we rounded the corner by the Chapel (in a seemingly well-choreographed move), there was Frank Marino welcoming me to Muhlenberg College.  My thoughts are with Mrs. Marino, and their wonderful family.</p>

Frank always had a kind word for everyone and appreciated every thing that was done for him, no matter how little, and showed his gratitude to everyone.

				<div class="comment-body"><p>Coach Marino&#8217;s dedication to Muhlenberg was truly inspiring. I can honestly say that the Coach and Mrs. Marino are why I became a Mule. Ever since I was a child, my father, Ed Sobel &#8217;79, made sure to bring me to see the Marinos whenever they were in our area. The Coach was so enthusiastic about Muhlenberg that he convinced a native Florida girl to spend her collegiate years in freezing (yet wonderful) Allentown, Pennsylvania. My family and I are eternally grateful to the coach for his enthusiasm and support. Our thoughts are with Mrs. Marino and the rest of the Marino family.</p>

				<div class="comment-body"><p>Frank may have been an incredibly successful coach of football and volleyball, but what he coached best was life. I will never forget his warmth and how he never missed a chance to praise me in front of others; I learned from him to &#8220;shuffle my feet&#8221; whenever he did.</p>
<p>I wrote an article on Frank in 1995, and here&#8217;s what he said when asked about his coaching philosophy:<br />
&#8220;First and foremost, you must always remember that they&#8217;re human beings that require treatment with dignity. They are not X&#8217;s and O&#8217;s, they are not number 32 or 55. They are somebody&#8217;s children, somebody&#8217;s friend.&#8221;</p>
<p>God bless Frank and his family.</p>

I can still see his smile as I passed him on campus and greeted him with &#8220;Hi Coach&#8221; &#8211; it didn&#8217;t matter that I was a &#8220;girl&#8221; and not one of his football players.  He may not have known my name, but he recognized me each time I saw him on campus.  The last time I saw Coach was at our 25th reunion.   He was exactly the same gentle, kind, loving man we knew in college.  He will be missed.  I want to say thank you to the Marino family for sharing your husband and your dad with his Muhlenberg family.</p>

				<div class="comment-body"><p>I greatly admired Frank&#8217;s gift of appreciation at the individual level.  I was in the band at &#8216;Berg and we provided a lot of pep and energy in the stands with our music.  We learned the &#8220;Rocky&#8221; theme from the popular movie as a cheer and added it to our repertoire.  As the lead trumpet at the time, it was my job to make sure the band was heard loudly across the stadium by encouraging lots of energy from our small but committed group.  Frank told me repeatedly how he appreciated the way the Rocky theme and other cheers motivated the team to play harder, to push themselves further and onto victory.  Years later, my wife Wendy (Garrett), also class of 81, and I would run into Frank at college alumni events and if Frank was there, he would always remember us (she was in the band also) and express appreciation for our support back then.  Appreciation for the individual&#8217;s effort is one of the hallmarks of a great leader and he was fantastic at that gift.  Godspeed Frank.</p>

				<div class="comment-body"><p>Because of Coach Marino&#8217;s association with my brother Paul, who played for Coach from 1967-1971, my matriculation at Muhlenberg was made easier.  I fondly remember his &#8220;Philosophy of Coaching&#8221; class that certainly helped me later when I was coaching youth travel soccer.  He always called me by name (or little Werrell) and he will always be remembered by me as an extremely nice man who cared about every individual he touched.  My time at &#8216;Berg was better because of Coach.<br />
The prayers and thoughts of my family are with the Marino family today.  He will always be with us carrying the maroon and grey as his legacy.</p>

				<div class="comment-body"><p>I cannot believe that Coach Marino is gone.  We had such a great time together back in October at the 30th Reunion of the 1980 Kulan Football team.  Seeing Coach and Carroll brought back such great memories of my time at Muhlenberg and playing football.  Coach Marino&#8217;s influences extended far beyond the athletic field; he was certainly a mentor to me in my personal and professional life.  Working in the field of education and athletics I took many of the life lessons taught by Coach and used them in my teaching and coaching career.  Coach Marino inspired me in so many ways to be successful. Aside from my parents there has been no greater influence upon my life.  I am sure that many of my former team mates feel the same way.  God Bless you Coach.</p>

				<div class="comment-body"><p>Having worked with Coach since my arrival at Muhlenberg in 1983 I can honestly say that was Muhlenberg&#8230;coach, friend, mentor, advisor, father to all he came in contact with.  Carol, know that you are in the thoughts and prayers of myself, Karen, Katy and Alex.  We will never forget Coach and how wonderful he was to us&#8230;the kids still talk about the boat ride on the Lake and how fast Coach made the boat go!  He will always be part of our family and will be missed.</p>

				<div class="comment-body"><p>Frank and Carroll and their wonderful family came into my life in 1967, when Frank joined the Muhlenberg family. Since then, I have known Frank as a colleague, golf buddy and a friend. We shared many laughs and a few tears through the years, and our respective families stayed close all these decades.</p>
<p>I lack the words to convey the respect, the kinship and love I felt for this exceptional man. His passing is a great loss to all who knew him.</p>
<p>My hearfelt payers go out to Carroll, Pam, Laura, Clare and their families.</p>
<p>Good-bye COACH, and thank you for including me among your many friends!</p>

				<div class="comment-body"><p>My thoughts and prayers go to Carol and the extended Marino family.  I always new who Coach was when I attended Muhlenberg (didn&#8217;t everyone?), but when I started working on the Admissions staff I got to know how wonderful Frank was.  What a gift he was to all of us! He was often my co-pilot in a van full of Muhlenberg folks heading to a reception for prospective students and families and I loved his company and his wisdom. His positive and endearing personality touched so many and transformed our lives&#8211; a real Muhlenberg treasure.</p>

				<div class="comment-body"><p>I met Coach when I was a Freshmen at the &#8216;Berg. My Dad, Richard Toth &#8217;72, played for Coach for 4 years and always told me what an amazing Coach and person he was. I had seen pictures of Coach and when I first saw him on campus in 2000 I introduced myself. For the rest of my career at the &#8216;Berg, I remember running into him on campus and he would ALWAYS stop to ask how I was doing and inquire about my Dad. Although I was not lucky enough to be coached by him, he always made me feel as though I was a part of his &#8220;family.&#8221; I will never forget seeing Coach and his wife walking on the track as they did so often. My family will dearly miss him and our thoughts are with his entire family.</p>

I hope you all felt the love and support oozing from Chew Street across the short miles to your place. We are still standing, waiting to know what we can do to ease the pain..ready to do whatever it takes. The same dedication, passion you have displayed for Muhlenberg in every encounter, is there in our hearts for the Marino family. It&#8217;s what we want to do for Frank and for you Carroll. We are family.<br />

				<div class="comment-body"><p>Frank was such an extraordinary individual.  If you were lucky enough to know Frank, you were lucky enough.  When speakig with Frank, he always made me feel like I was one of his closest &#8211; most valued friends.  I bet if you asked half the campus community&#8230;they would all say the same thing :).  What a gift.  He was the definition of a true gentleman.  I enjoyed his many stories&#8230;.like gentlemen&#8230;.&#8221;Don&#8217;t embarrass the family name&#8221; and just so many countless others.  </p>
<p>As tears stream down my face, I know there will be a huge void left within the Muhlenberg community that will never be filled be anyone else.  Homecomings and Reunions will never be same without a bear hug from Frank.  How blessed we were to have had Frank in our lives.  My condolences to Caroll and the enitre Marino family.  Heaven just received an angel!  I will miss you my friend.</p>

				<div class="comment-body"><p>The Muhlenberg community has lost a truly wonderful person.  Not being an athlete, I was fortunate to enroll in Coach Marino&#8217;s &#8220;Principles and Philosophies of Coaching&#8221; class.  He enjoyed the early morning sessions and got to know everyone there (even though most were half asleep anyway).  The quote I took away from that class is something that has stayed with me for over 35 years: &#8220;The mind can only absorb what the seat can endure.&#8221;  Years later, when I returned for reunions, Coach remembered me and always recalled our friendly ribbing about the Flyers vs. the Rangers.  My condolences to his family.  Coach, you will be fondly remembered forever.</p>

				<div class="comment-body"><p>I had the pleasure of meeting Coach Marino shortly after arriving at school in 1995.  Although he never actually coached me on the field, he was every bit a coach to me.  Coach was a huge supporter of every sport at Muhlenberg, and an even bigger supporter of the students themselves.  No matter when he saw me, he always took the time to ask how things were going.  I will never forget his caring thoughts following my last season of lacrosse in 1999.  He penned a thank you note to me after my final game, filled with kind words of how it was a pleasure to see me play.  Yet, it is Coach Marino that I know no one will ever forget.  My heart goes out to his family and you are all in our prayers.</p>

He truly lived a life of joy which was always in evidence whenever I was lucky enough to run into him over the years.  Frank connected with the greater Muhlenberg College community from the moment of his arrival on campus.  From coaching football, lacrosse, and volleyball teams, to holding college administration positions and interacting with current students and alums&#8230;..he did it all with grace.<br />
My heart goes out to those special people most dear to him:  Carroll, the girls and their families.</p>

His optimistic attitude and genuine personality served us all well and he will certainly be missed!  I can echo the point that many have made previously, for as long as I had been away, during a visit to campus at reunion, it was a surprise to be remembered by him as though we had never parted.

				<div class="comment-body"><p>Caroll and family:  Hearing about the death of Frank is crushing.  Frank was always genteel, kind and dramatically interested in the other person.   That was the way that I always saw him in the few interactions I had with him. He was a great coach, administrator and &#8220;lover&#8221; of the college.  As you know,  I never had the opportunity to work with Frank (he used to thank me for leaving Muhlenberg in &#8217;67) so that he could work at &#8220;this great school&#8221;.  Everything I  heard about Frank from Muhlenberg associates was positive and enthusiastic.  Phrases such as &#8220;great man&#8221;,  &#8220;wonderful spokesperson for the college&#8221; and &#8220;effective developer of young people&#8221; were frequent.  He will be greatly missed by many former colleagues, athletes, students and friends.  I consider it a great honor to have known him.</p>
<p>Caroll, I extend my deepest sympathies to you and your family.  I pray that God will heal this loss in time for you and your family.  I also pray that the  many fond memories you had as you built your lives and dreams together will also help sustain you in the months and years ahead.</p>
<p>Loss of  a spouse is challenging, but life goes on and his life will always be with you.  You are one very fortunate family to have had the gift of his life to help shape all of you in many positive and fufilling ways. </p>
<p>&#8220;May the Lord bless you and keep you.  May His face shine upon you and your family and may you have everlasting peace.&#8221;  To God Alone Be the Glory for the great things He has done!  Charlie Kuntzleman</p>

				<div class="comment-body"><p>For as long as I can remember, Mr. and Mrs. Marino have been a part of<br />
my life.  Before I was born Mr. Marino vowed to call me “Mickey” in<br />
honor of the late, great Mickey Mantle.  So eighteen years later, as a<br />
member of the Muhlenberg softball team, I would hear Mr. Marino<br />
shouting from the stands at Patriots Park, “C’mon Mickey!”  Our<br />
families shared so much in common, including a love of Muhlenberg. How<br />
thrilled I was to be admitted as a member of the Class of 2000.  I don’t think Mr.<br />
Marino ever knew just how special he was to so many of us. His modesty<br />
would not allow that.  His ability to put a smile on someone’s face<br />
was uncanny.  He was a beloved, cherished member of the Muhlenberg<br />
family and the College is fortunate to have had him as an advocate for<br />
more than four decades.  That precious smile will be emblazoned in my<br />
mind and heart forever.  I love you Mr. Marino, and will never forget<br />
you.  My thoughts and prayers are with Mrs. Marino, their daughters<br />
and families.</p>

				<div class="comment-body"><p>Coach was an amazing man, my mentor and inspiration and a father figure to me.  He convinced me to come visit Muhlenberg, and it was probably one of the most important decisons that has positively impacted my life ever since.  The dedication that Coach and Carroll have shown to the college, but beyond that the people of Muhlenberg College is unbelievable.  I had the honor of having Coach as my volleyball coach, and his ability to teach, lead, motivate and inspire young women for whom he truly loved and cared about, was and is like nothing I have ever experienced in all my years of playing and coaching.  Coach was the reason that I decided to become a coach and I owe Coach so much.   I know that Coach Marino influenced so many and I in particular am so grateful to him.  To Mrs. Coach, the girls, Jimmy &amp; Charlie whose presence at practice was always cherished and the rest of the Marino family, my deepest condolences and sympathies to you.  What Coach created with every team and the sisterhood will always be remembered and cherished!  He will be greatly missed!</p>

I will always remember that his lessons about volleyball applied more to living life, and I&#8217;ve benefited from his teachings everyday since.  To this day I tell my children about Buttermaker.<br />
Carroll and Marino family  &#8212; I&#8217;m truly sorry for the loss and I send my condolences.  Coach Marino will live on in us all.</p>

				<div class="comment-body"><p>We got to know Frank as alumni.  He was always upbeat and could bring a smile to your face.  He said Lois and I had Cardinal &amp; Grey blood in our veins.  The same goes for him.  We haven&#8217;t known too many non-alums who had the same passion and dedication to Muhlenberg as Frank did.<br />
Frank will live on in the memories of all whose lives he touched, and as part of the<br />
history of Muhlenberg.  God bless Carroll and Frank&#8217;s family, and keep them in<br />
His care.</p>

				<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;m sorry to hear about the passing of Coach Marino.  He was a great supporter of every athlete no matter what the sport.  After graduating, I ran into him at an alumni function a number of years later and he remembered me like it was yesterday.  I had hoped to see him now that my daughter is a student at M&#8217;berg and feel that a piece of my past is missing.  RIP, Coach and my thoughts go out to your family.</p>

				<div class="comment-body"><p>As a four year member and co-captain of the 1975 lacrosse team, I fondly remember my association with Coach and our teammates and staff.  I remember specifically his affinity for ending practice with wind sprints up the embankment on our practice field.<br />
&#8220;You&#8217;re making deposits in the bank that we can withdraw during the fourth quarter in our next game!&#8221; he would bellow.  We would cuss him out but run the banks until released from the hell of it all.  Our &#8217;74 team was the first to finish with a winning record, thanks to all of the deposits we made that season.</p>

				<div class="comment-body"><p>Flobby and I saw coach and had lunch with him before one of the Mules playoff games two years ago.  As usual, all he wanted to talk about was the family, how was everyone, how is mom, how are the kids,&#8230;  I told him I had been coaching high school lacrosse including my son and many of his friends so I was really close with the boys.  They were always at the house so , more like a father than a coach, it was sometimes (but not always) hard for me to come down too hard on them on the field.  But after an embarrassing on-field act my coaches and I cancelled a practice and had an intense meeting with all the boys.  Somewhere during the meeting, after I started to calm down and mello out,  I told them about coach Marino, my days at the Berg and all about &#8220;the family&#8221;.  I told them about our teams, how close we were and how we truly were a family.  Then I gave them the &#8220;don&#8217;t embarrass the family&#8221; talk.  We were all young kids and players when we got to know Coach Marino, and back then maybe it didn&#8217;t seem like everything coach tried to teach us sank in.  But we all know today what a powerful impact coach had on our lives.  Last year, one of my former lacrosse players passed away while at college.  Sadly he was my son&#8217;s best friend and ironically he also became an ATO brother, so we were very close.  At his service I told all my former players how they could help Brennen&#8217;s legacy live on by taking something they treasured about Brennen or learned from him and just pass it on or live it for the rest of their life.  Many of them were 21 and that night wanted to go out and have a drink as part of their goodbye to Brennen.  The coach and father in me was still there so my next words to them were about to be a lecture about being careful, sticking together, making smart choices and being responsible.  Then one of my  former team captains looked at me and said, &#8220;don&#8217;t worry coach, we won&#8217;t embarrass the family&#8221;.   Funny, Coach Marino did have such a powerful impact on all of our lives, so much so that now we are passing it on.  And surprisingly it gets through.  I&#8217;m glad I got to tell him that when I last saw him.  Now I am sure that Coach&#8217;s legacy will always live on.  I love you Coach!</p>

				<div class="comment-body"><p>I still remember the day I went on my visit to Muhlenberg.  Coach met my mom and I and told me the story about the Buttermakers.  When I drove off campus that day, I told my mom that I was going to Muhlenberg, and applying to no other schools.  This had everything to do with Coach Marino and his ability to make everyone feel welcome.  I had the pleasure of playing volleyball for Coach Marino.  I will never forget the way he handled difficult situations, how he talked to everyone with respct, and how he had the ability to know everyone at the school, regardless of whether they played for him or not.  One of the best decisions I ever made in my life was attending Muhlenberg and I always silently thank Coach for being an integral part of my decision.  My thoughts and prayers go out to Mrs. Coach and the rest of the family&#8230;rest in peace Coach Marino, you touched all of our lives!</p>

Knowing him from his Morris Hills and Morris Knolls days, we remember Frank as a great educator, which included his ability to motivate the student athlete. Although we haven&#8217;t been in contact with Frank over the years, knowing of his passing still leaves a void.  Our deepest sympathy.</p>

				<div class="comment-body"><p>I am deeply saddened to hear about the passing of Coach Marino. As a member of his football team from 1971 to1974, I will always remember him as a man who guided his team with passion and compassion.  Today we live in an era where winning is everything and it does not matter if it is Division I or Division III.  While Coach Marino’s mission each year was to win the Centennial League Championship, he never got too down when things were going poorly and never got overly excited even after a big win.  And it didn’t matter if you were the starting quarterback or the last guy whom he would call to get into the game; he treated everyone with equal respect and humanity.  I know that in my 28 years of coaching football, his influence has always been part of my coaching philosophy.  I am so happy that the football field was named in his honor several years ago, and whenever I get on my Mac during the football season to see how the Mules have played on a given Saturday, I will think of Coach Marino and the many outrageous, fun, and memorable times my teammates and I had during our years on the gridiron under his firm hand. Rest in Peace.</p>

				<div class="comment-body"><p>Words cannot express what Frank Marino meant to our four years at Muhlenberg.  Of course I met Coach when I came to visit the school, an unrecruited tiny lineman from an 0-11 high school team.  Then, I saw him after an &#8220;all star&#8221; game for our High School league.  It wasn&#8217;t made up of many all stars, rather those who were willing to play in August.  Some misfits started a fight at the end of the game, which upset me, and I walked away not paying attention to anyone.  Then Coach Marino said hi, but due to what was going on, I didn&#8217;t even recognize him.  I thought, &#8220;Oh great, I just blew off my future coach.&#8221;  When I arrived at the &#8220;Berg&#8221; coach told me that actually that taught him everything he needed to know about me.  Actually, it taught me what I needed to know about Coach Marino.  He, and others on staff, had more faith in me than I had in myself. They stuck with me.  He was kind and firm and stood for all the values you admire most in a person.  Yes, &#8220;don&#8217;t embaress the family&#8221; still sticks with me.  So does Coach Marino showing up as we stretched saying:  We have footballs. We have guys.  Let&#8217;s practice.  It was a game for Coach, a good game, but a game none-the-less.  My prayers go with the whole family, and to my teammates, who are friends in large part, because of Frank Marino.</p>

				<div class="comment-body"><p>I was shocked and saddened to hear of Frank (Pinkie) Marino&#8217;s death.  We met when Pinkie was a senior and editor-in-chief of the Stylus, the College at Brockport&#8217;s newspaper and I was a freshman typist and sometimes reporter for the school paper.  We reconnected as alumni in later years and I always looked forward to seeing both Pinkie and Carroll whenever they were able to return to our alma mater.<br />
No finer person has ever graduated from our college.  He was loved and respected by all who knew him.<br />
My sincere condolences to Carroll, their family and all his Muhlenberg family.</p>

				<div class="comment-body"><p>The Muhlenberg community has lost one of its finest representatives.  Coach touched so many lives; and in so many different wonderful ways.  We should all be grateful for the memories.  For me&#8230;it has always been &#8220;don&#8217;t embarrass the family&#8221;, the 1980 football season and his endearing, gap-toothed smile.  Coach always made you feel special.  My thoughts and prayers to Carroll and the family.</p>

				<div class="comment-body"><p>Muhlenberg has lost a very dedicated friend. While not  alumni, Frank and Caroll have been more dedicated to Muhlenberg than some alumni. He was a caring, sensitive friend to a lot of us. Frank will surely be missed. We send our condolences to Carroll and the Marino family. They will be in our thoughts.</p>

				<div class="comment-body"><p>Coach Marino was a true inspiration to all who met him.  Most of my memories from Muhlenberg are about him and the &#8220;sisterhood&#8221; he created around the volleyball team.  I have grown to value everything he has ever said and I try to teach my students and athletes the morals he has passed on to me.  I will forever remind my kids to &#8220;mind their m and m&#8217;s&#8221; and to be confident and proud of who they are.  I owe a great deal to Coach Marino and will miss him dearly.  I hope that I too can have such a positive impact on the students and athletes that I meet during my teaching career.<br />
    My condolences to Mrs. Coach and the Marino family.  Thank you for sharing Coach with all of us.</p>

				<div class="comment-body"><p>Coach Marino has influenced me every day of my 14 year coaching career here at the college.  From the first day I met him during my interview, when he, more than anyone else, convinced me that Muhlenberg had the rich history, the pride and the desire to field a winning football team, he had, and will continue to have, a huge, powerful, positive impact on me and the football program here at the college.  His strength of personality, his open and straight forward approach, his honesty, his honor, his integrity, his love of his family, the college and his &#8220;boys&#8221; will continue to be inspirational to me and hopefully through me, our current players.  He was a tremendous role model and I count myself lucky to have known him and to know his lovely bride Carol.  </p>
<p>Carol is one of those really special people and she understands what it means to be a football coach’s wife.  Carol and my wife Beth hit it off right away.  She is classy and one of the best.  Coach Marino knew he &#8220;outkicked his coverage&#8221; when he convinced Carol to marry him.  He considered himself to be a lucky guy to have such a wife and such a special family.  I know that Carol and the family have suffered a great loss and I hope that she will draw strength from all of us who think so much of Frank and her.</p>
<p>Like all of us who knew Frank, we have stories!  Not as many as Frank had and certainly very few of us can tell a story like he could or make you laugh like he could &#8211; but here are two that I would like to share.         </p>
<p>Frank would always stop in my office, pump his fist at me and tell me, win or lose, that &#8220;we&#8217;re with you.&#8221;   I would try to get him to sit down and relax and just talk because I loved talking about life and football and Muhlenberg football with him, but as everyone who knew him will attest, he never wanted to interrupt or disrupt (even though he wasn&#8217;t) so most times he would not stay long &#8211; always with more to do in his day.  </p>
<p>When I introduced him to the team one time a few years back, as a &#8216;great coach,&#8217; he was openly embarrassed and so humble that I thought maybe I should not have said what I said.  When he started to talk he became the coach of the team as easily as if it was 1980; different setting, different faces, same great game at the same great college.  Our kids loved it &#8211; they made an instant connection with Coach and you could see the look in their faces that said &#8216;I just met somebody who is important to Muhlenberg football, who gets it, someone who loves Muhlenberg and football and athletics here at the college, somebody worth listening to.&#8217;  Looking back I am glad I said he was a great coach and one of the links in the history of our program!  </p>
<p>Most people work hard; some people ‘make it’ in life; few people are remembered for all the good things they did during their life.  Coach Marino is one of those very special people who will be remembered and will live on in our hearts and minds.</p>

				<div class="comment-body"><p>I had limited contact with Frank Marino while I attended &#8216;Berg.  But, I would like to thank Coach for marrying Carrol.  Why?  When fundraisers were held in Florida, I attended and had wonderful chats with Carrol Marino.  Not only was she friendly, chipper and elegant&#8230; Carrol was quite the &#8220;chatty bird.&#8221;  Frank always chided me about monopolizing time by conversing with his wife.  Always one to have a smile on his face, Coach was so good-natured about me speaking to his &#8220;princess,&#8221; as Coach referred to his wife.  So, it is with prayers of peace and fortitude that I mourn Frank Maino&#8217;s passing and, I wish only health and strength to Carrol Marino and their children and grandchildren at this trying time.  Carrol, may you be steadied by knowing that your husband is  loved by the entire Muhlenberg College community.</p>

				<div class="comment-body"><p>When  Coach Marino arrived as an assistant coach of the Mule football team, I was an offensive lineman.  Though Coach was an offensive backfield coach, he made it his business to get to know each player on the team.  I was honored when he and Carol and Sam and Connie Beidleman attended my wedding in 19970 after graduation.  Seven or eight years later I had the good fortune to become team physician at Muhlenberg.  Frank was kind enough to let me and my two young boys onto the sideline for games.  That experience resulted in  many memories which my son Dan and I still recall fondly.  Carol was the kindergarten teacher to my children and Frank always remembered their names and never failed to ask after them.</p>
<p>Though he was not an alumnus, Coach probably knew more about Muhlenberg than almost anyone on campus.  He even discovered that there is a stained glass window of a football player in the chapel!  I am told that he would show that to the mothers of students he was recruiting, in a subtle way letting Mother know that her boy would be in good hands with this coach who knew that football was important but certainly not the most important thing in her boy&#8217;s life at Muhlenberg.</p>
<p>I think Coach&#8217;s effectiveness  as a football coach and recruiter and later as a good will ambassador for Muhlenberg was because of a special talent he had.  He was able to make anyone feel like you were the most important person he was going to speak to that day, and for a few minutes that was probably true!  I believe that is why so many of us miss him and have felt compelled to write about him. </p>
<p>Coach you never let the family down! We all miss you.</p>
<p>Glenn</p>

				<div class="comment-body"><p>The day my dad and I met Coach Marino-I knew I would attend Muhlenberg and play volleyball for him. As a coach-he taught many of us so much more than volleyball and teamwork. He went above and beyond for many of us. He will be fondly missed. Our love and condolences to his lovely family.

				<div class="comment-body"><p>I can not believe that Coach is gone!  It seems like I was procrastinating forever to make it back to a reunion (coming frm the west coast) at &#8216;Berg, but I always knew there was one vist that I had to make&#8230;.to Coach Marino.   I have so many memories of him as our Lacroses coach in the 1967-70 seasons.  How he was a green coach when it came to Lacrosse, but knew so well how to coach a group of unruley &#8220;pampered suburbanites&#8221; that he actually made us into a pretty good team that ultimately had a winning season.  Memories of Frank&#8217;s Bank (where the performing arts center now sits) still make my legs hurt.<br />
Finally as my 40th Reunion rolled around I made it back to Allentown and was able to catch Frank at the Union and give him a hand shake and a hug to let him know what he meant to me.  After he was done telling my wife lies about how good a lacrosse player I was, I almost cried as we said good by.<br />
I guess now it is good by forever and I hope he realized how much we all loved him and how much he shaped our lives.  The &#8216;Berg community has lost a great citizen and my family&#8217;s deepest condolences to Mrs Marino and the rest of all our family in Allentown and Muhlenberg.</p>

				<div class="comment-body"><p>Brenda and I are extremely saddened to hear of Coach Marino&#8217;s death.  Our sympathies go out to Carol and her family.   Coach Marino was a class act all the way and an outstanding coach and ambassador for Muhlenberg.   I have many good memories of games, practices and other interaction with Coach.  In particular I remember the fact that he made sure that I still felt like part of the team when I was injured in 1970 and missed more than half of the season.   To say that Coach Marino was an Icon to the Muhlenberg community might not be sufficient praise.</p>

				<div class="comment-body"><p>It takes a special trust to turn your child over to the care and guidance of another.  Frank Marino earned that trust very quickly during our first visit to Muhlenberg.  That trust was never misplaced and turned into respect and friendship for both he and Carroll.  Our daughter still feels that Coach Marino is among the most influential people in her life.</p>
<p>Coach’s influence extends to many people all over the country.  I remember meeting a young person in the check out line at a supermarket in California (I was wearing a Muhlenberg sweat shirt).  The first thing she asked was if we knew Coach Marino.  In fact, we met several people in California who knew or played for Coach – all with fond memories.</p>
<p>Our deepest condolences to Carroll and her family, and to the Muhlenberg community as a whole.</p>

				<div class="comment-body"><p>Frank was a true gentleman, and a significant reason for the growth in stature of the Muhlenberg athletic program. While I never played for him, I got to know him through other sports at the school. He would never forget my name, offering a great hug whenever I returned to campus. How much better does it get than having the kind of impact on young men that lasts a lifetime.</p>

				<div class="comment-body"><p>I will always be grateful to Mr Marino for inspiring me…not in football (I can&#8217;t stand the game &#8211; sorry) but to get through college.  There was a time when I was struggling with calculus &amp; physics and contemplating quitting.  During a semester break at home, I saw a clock that he had recently made. Previous to this, he always claimed that he had no mechanical aptitude&#8230;which I validated on occasions such as the time he required help just to install a toilet seat.  So, when I saw his hand made clock, it helped me go back to school and keep trying.  After all, if the Coach could make a clock, anything was possible.  His positive attitude, encouragement and his laugh will be remembered.</p>

				<div class="comment-body"><p>When my father and I visited Muhlenberg for the final time &#8212; as I was deciding whether to enroll or go elsewhere &#8212; we paid a visit to the chapel.  There was Coach, sitting in the last pew, paying a visit himself.  He greeted us with a huge smile and a handshake.  We spoke for a few minutes.  He talked to us about his &#8220;Muhlenberg family,&#8221; and asked us about ours.  The conversation was warm and welcoming, just like Coach.  As he left, he turned to me and said, &#8220;You&#8217;ll come here, and you&#8217;ll be happy.&#8221;  I did, and I was.  I guess I always felt like Coach was like a guardian angel to me at Muhlenberg.  And now, he really will be one.   Carroll, you and your incredible family are in our prayers.</p>

				<div class="comment-body"><p>We were both shocked and deeply saddened to hear of Frank&#8217;s passing. He was one of a kind, the likes of which won&#8217;t be seen again. I remember him not just as a coach, but a wonderful friend long after graduation. Clint and I spent many evenings with Coach and Carroll at Muhlenberg events , dinners at Brookside,etc. He had a knack of filling a room, a table, or a simple couch with laughter and warmth&#8211; one of the most &#8220;real&#8221; people I&#8217;ve ever known. And, his stories?! I remember him telling me that the first lacrosse game he ever saw was the first one he coached at Muhlenberg! You&#8217;d have never known it!<br />
And, what a tremendous ambassador for Muhlenberg. His genuine love for &#8216;Berg was there for all to see.<br />
We will miss him dearly. Our thoughts and prayers are with Carroll, their daughters, and grandchildren, and hope they find comfort in knowing the impact he had on so many lives.</p>

				<div class="comment-body"><p>We were very saddened to learn of the death of our special friend, Frank Marino.  Our thoughts, prayers  and sincerest sympathy are with his dear wife, Carroll, and their wonderful family.  We are deeply grateful for all the warmth, wit and wisdom Frank shared with us over the years and for his exemplary dedication to the Muhlenberg community; the College is a much better place because of Coach&#8217;s many and diverse contributions.  And what an unforgettable boat ride he captained across Lake Chautauqua many years ago!! 🙂 .<br />
We are very sorry that family/work commitments  keep us from attending his memorial service- our hearts will be there with you, Carroll and family. Frank touched many lives deeply and his love shines on!</p>

				<div class="comment-body"><p>Frank Marino is a truly wonderful and loving man and is truly missed. I could not believe it when the notification came across my email. I have had Frank and Carol on my mind the last several weeks and had resolved to call them after the holidays to catch up. I am so sorry I did not call when I first thought about it. Frank was a huge reason why I chose to matriculate at &#8216;Berg. I always remember how he described Muhlenberg and the football team as family to my parents and I. And Frank was absolutely right and I am truly thankful for my time at Muhlenberg, with Frank and my football brothers. Frank was like having a third parent around and will be truly missed! My love and condolences go out to you Carol and Pam. Do not hesitate to reach out if you need anything and I promise to keep in touch with you! To be absent from the body is to be present with the Lord. We will see each other again! God bless!</p>

				<div class="comment-body"><p>Coach.  That one word is how I remember Coach Marino, very descriptive but incomplete. I met Coach in &#8220;our&#8221; freshman year, 1967. I wish I had played for him because I would have benefitted in many ways. He always remembered my name through the years after I graduated.</p>
<p>When I was a fledgling reporter for the Weekly, he offered to let me join him to watch film so he could Teach me. He was easy to approach and it was easier to talk with him.</p>
<p>I recall the look he gave me when he learned I was dating a Morris Knolls cheerleader whom he knew. In retrospect, I think Coach was also Dad.</p>
<p>Coach enriched Muhlenberg College and the extended community of families and friends. Muhlenberg benefits today from the fact Coach chose Muhlenberg.</p>
<p>Sincerely, I extend my sympathy to the Marino family.</p>

				<div class="comment-body"><p>Like so many others whose comments fill this webpage, I was welcomed into the Muhlenberg family by Frank and Carroll with warmth and enthusiasm.  I first heard Frank speak to the incoming class of 2007 during Orientation &#8211; telling the freshmen how fortunate they were to be part of the Muhlenberg Family.  I felt like he was speaking to me too.  Throughout all my years at the College Frank and Carroll pitched in to help the College in any way they could &#8211; keeping their extensive family of friends in touch with the campus, cheering on our students &#8211; on and off the athletic fields, greeting and welcoming new staff, encouraging me when things were tough.  Frank set an example of how to live a life.  I know that Carroll and his family will miss him terribly, as will hundreds of other Muhlenberg family members.  I am confident that Frank is in heaven, probably organizing a get-together for friends and former players who have gone on before us.  I&#8217;m sure that they are glad to see him, and that, if we live our lives by his example, he&#8217;ll be there to greet each of us when we get there some day. Frank, I miss you my friend. Rest in peace.</p>

				<div class="comment-body"><p>I am so terribly sorry to learn of Frank’s passing. Stunned actually. I re-read the notice from President Helm and returned home at the end of the day to revisit the Marino family Christmas card with Frank’s hand written note with his inimitable scribble across the center of the page “Hope all is well – Coach.” I can’t remember the last time I couldn’t contain my emotions as my mind unleashed a streaming highlight video of Frank.  He came into my life 40 years ago as he strolled down the halls of Summit High School with his infectious smile, his Staten Island swagger and his firm handshake. I was immediately impressed by his poise, his enthusiasm and his affection for this place in eastern Pennsylvania called Muhlenberg College. I had never heard of the school but Frank got me to agree to a visit and won me over to the Mule Team with his Marino Magic. He promised me a first rate education and if I worked hard a chance to play two sports at the collegiate level. I was so fortunate to be a member of the 1973 team that defeated Widener; a fantastic group of guys who had a date with destiny driven to the dance by a humble man who earned and deserved our best. Frank showed me the Red Doors on campus that opened lifelong friendships and career opportunities knowing they would also inspire loyalty to the Cardinal and Grey. As a teacher and coach he went well beyond the x’s and o’s, mining nuggets of wisdom from his experiences and planting value seeds of honesty, integrity and modesty into the minds, hearts and souls of his students and players. His love for his family, his “kids” and Muhlenberg was remarkable. He beamed with pride when he told stories of his children and loved to share successes of former students and athletes. Through my lens he was the quintessential role model that will live on in the memories and through the actions of many.  Marino Field may primarily be a tribute to his body of work as a coach and service to Muhlenberg but it is my hope that every Mule that steps on that turf will honor the extraordinary qualities of Frank Marino the man through primed, impassioned and fair play. The dome on the Haas College Center, a beacon of the school, will shine ever more brightly now that Frank Marino will be smiling down on it.  I offer my sincere condolences to Carroll and family as well as his friends and colleagues in the Muhlenberg Community.</p>

				<div class="comment-body"><p>Mind your M&amp;M&#8217;s&#8230;..don&#8217;t embarrass the family&#8230;.sisterhood&#8230;.Buttermakers&#8230;.words of wisdom from one of the wisest coaches in college athletics.   I had the honor and privilege to work with Frank during his tenure as the volleyball coach.  He demonstrated the true meaning of athletics&#8230;..PASSION!   His passion and drive was based on a simple belief&#8230;&#8230;people TOGETHER!  In athletics, there are so many talented people&#8230;.but Frank believed the true talent is the ability to believe in yourself and have belief in your team.   If your team can honor your trust to give your best effort all the time&#8230;.in the gym&#8230;in the classroom and in society&#8230;.you will be successful.</p>
<p>Many people preach how to do what is right&#8230;..Frank lived it.  Spending time with Frank on the bench, in the van on road trips, in  the car recruiting&#8230;..he always spoke of people.  All topics&#8230;.football&#8230;lacrosse&#8230;the Lake&#8230;his math tutor Carroll&#8230;.and the YANKEES.  His love for his family&#8230;Carroll&#8230;his girls and their families( Charley and Jimmy and your cousins and dads) he loved so much he was always excited to go to Widener to see Clare&#8217;s family or up to New England with a chance to see Laura&#8230;and always having Jimmy and Charley with the team  knowing he would see Pam or Andy.  He cherished those moments.  What he  demonstrated was how important family was to the team.  He lived life with love for everyone.  The volleyball community was his extended family.  My life has been enriched with the daily experiences (forever cherished) working with Coach Frank&#8230;.a legend&#8230;a mentor&#8230;a friend&#8230;and now&#8230;a guiding spirit.    His teachings will continue to live&#8230;.the sisters from the teams continue to carry on their togetherness in their families.  Now they are the preaching sisters speaking his words of wisdom: together&#8230;.mind your m&amp;m&#8217;s&#8230;..family!  We love you Frank!!!!</p>

As &#8220;Coach&#8221; ran by our Chautauqua home calling out &#8220;Hi Doris&#8221;, he endeared us to him even more. So many wonderful memories of summers shared, children&#8221;shared&#8221;.  There was so much more we wanted to share as time was more available.  Coach was always ready with a story, he&#8217;s, now, still teaching don&#8217;t wait til tomorrow, you never know what the future holds.  He is already missed, T and Dianne McMahon</p>

				<div class="comment-body"><p>Here I was at Muhlenberg in &#8217;73 trying out for a sport I barely knew anything about, Lacrosse, and a guy I had not yet met named Frank Marino was on the field providing his unique style of &#8220;leadership&#8221; as he would frequently remark loudly &#8220;Let&#8217;s get in there and I wanna see some serious hitting, you &#8220;pampered suburbanites&#8221;; otherwise I&#8217;m gonna have you &#8220;makin extra deposits in the bank&#8221; (a steep hill by the field) until you drop! Frank was alway that gentle, supportive, loving kind of guy. He made me dig down deep a bunch and I told him how much I appreciated him when we spoke a few years back&#8230;See you later, Coach.</p>

				<div class="comment-body"><p>Although not a jock at the College, my work in the Admissions Office and as a student in the popular &#8220;Philosophies and Principles of Coaching&#8221; and &#8220;Spectator Sports&#8221; courses let me get to know Frank Marino pretty well.  Whether he was imparting words of wisdom from his life and experiences, or keeping things loose with an impish look in his eye and his smile, Coach Marino helped us all to grow up just a little more and keep things in perspective.  He had the gift of making people feel special and keep a positive attitude.<br />
Condolences to Carroll and family from me and my wife Deborah Budich Dorshimer (Class of 1976).</p>

				<div class="comment-body"><p>Oh Frank! So many memories come flooding back! I had the honor of coaching with Frank when we coached the Women&#8217;s Lacrosse Team for one year together. The first day we met he looked at me and said, &#8220;Jill, I don&#8217;t know anything about coaching the girls&#8217; game, but I know about coaching.&#8221; So we started the season with the &#8220;Never do anything to embarrass the family&#8221; talk and away we went. It was a blessing to have Frank Marino dedicate himself to Muhlenberg College. Frank cried at my wedding, laughed at my dumb jokes, inspired me to take chances and continue coaching, to never take myself too seriously and absolutley, never give up. I love you Frank and when you get to heaven and see my dad, try to behave 😉</p>

				<div class="comment-body"><p>There aren’t enough words to express to Mrs. Marino and her family how sorry I am for their loss.  It doesn’t matter whether you knew Mr. Marino for years, or if you only met him once…the impression he left was undeniable and lasting.  His smile, his laugh, his stories, his words of wisdom…he had a spirit that was practically contagious and a capacity for love that was unending.  I will miss him, but am thankful that we’ll never truly have to say goodbye…because no matter how you knew him &#8211; as Mr. Marino, Coach, Frank, or just that wonderful person you met briefly on your first tour of Muhlenberg who made you smile &#8211; the legacy he leaves behind will stay with all of us for years to come.</p>
<p>Mrs. Marino, you and your wonderful husband have been part of my family for so many years… such a supportive and loving part…please know that we send you all our love in return, and that our thoughts and prayers are with you and your family.</p>

				<div class="comment-body"><p>I got to know Frank during his Morris County days as a high school football coach.  I was a very young newly appointed head football coach and he became one of my mentors.  Frank was  a gentleman of the first order and was always willing to share his expertise, the lessons he taught me were paramount during my 44 yr career as a head coach.  I still have the notes I took during some of our sessions.  One thing that always stuck with me was him saying that it was not about a particular offense or defense, it was about the kids.  Thus it is not surprising that he could be a success and have a terrific impact in any sport he chose to coach or in any endeavor he undertook.  We lost Coach but his legacy is left behind in so many.  Condolences to the family.</p>

				<div class="comment-body"><p>I was saddened to learn of the passing of Coach Marino. My husband and I met Coach Marino in the late 1970&#8217;s when our son Art was looking at colleges to attend. What a great decision Art made when he decided to attend Muhlenberg and play football. After talking to Coach Marino, you just knew that Muhlenberg was the place you wanted your child to attend with a kind and caring person like Coach Marino watching out for his football family on and off the field. Coach Frank Marino was an inspiration to all the lives he touched. Our families shared so much in common. One of my fondest memories was dinner at Coach and Carol&#8217;s house; my husband and Coach discovered that they played football in college at the same time, and their colleges played each other. Out came a film clip of Brockport vs. Montclair State, and there they were playing against one another. The teasing and laughter warmed your heart. Carol, I hope it will ease your sadness if you know that Coach Marino will be greatly missed by all his friends, and that we all share in your sadness.</p>

				<div class="comment-body"><p>Frank was indeed a great coach, and I enjoyed watching his football teams after I came to the College in 1978.  As a faculty member, one of the things I appreciated about Frank was that he always knew that the most important reason a young person came to college was not to play football, lacrosse, or volleyball, but to get an education.  He was always as concerned about that aspect of his players experience as their performance on the playing field.  </p>
<p>Carol and I always enjoyed his  stories, his wit, and his commitment to the College and especially to the people who were here as students, faculty, staff and administration.  We will miss him and send our sympathies to Carroll and his daughters and their families.  Dan Wilson</p>

				<div class="comment-body"><p>The first time I brought my daughter to Muhlenberg and met Coach Marino, I knew she was in loving hands.  Over the next four years, as a spectator in the bleachers, I watched Coach Marino&#8217;s love for my daughter and all his &#8220;kids&#8221;, and my daughter&#8217;s love for him blossom and grow.  He will be missed!</p>

				<div class="comment-body"><p>We always called him &#8220;Coach&#8221;, but he never was mine.  I often wished I were younger so he could have been.  He was what I believe a &#8220;Coach&#8221; should be &#8211; teacher, mentor, father figure, motivator and psychologist.  Ane he was more &#8211; friend, ambassador and fundraiser.  He and Carroll were one of the friendliest of our friends.  We always felt that we and *Berg were on the top of their list.<br />
     We know he is &#8220;up ther &#8221; now organizing a team.  That team may even be playing a spoart that &#8220;Coach&#8221; never played.  But you can count on this &#8211; they will play their best, play by the rules and they will have fun.<br />
     We just hope he heard enough of us say &#8220;Thanks, Coach&#8221; when he was with us.We want him to know he did not coach in vain.<br />

				<div class="comment-body"><p>Frank was a life force, for sure.  He would amble in, apologize if he were distracting us from what he referred to as &#8220;important work&#8221; in the Academic Resource Center, and proceed to ask about or work, pumping us up as he spoke. His kind words of support were therapeutic during our busy times, but his great stories and life lessons were the inspiration for us all to remain steadfast, enjoying the journey as we went along.  He will be sorely missed in our office.  Carroll, we hope to have you visit to continue the coach&#8217;s tradition! With my heartfelt sympathy, Wendy</p>

				<div class="comment-body"><p>The loss of Coach Marino is a great one.  He was a nice, welcoming man and was always great to my sister and I while we attended school at Muhlenberg.  He will truly be missed.  I always looked forward to running into him when we were back on campus or at some Muhlenberg event.  My deepest sympathies and condolences to Mrs. Marino and the rest of the family.</p>

				<div class="comment-body"><p>It is with great sadness that we face the future at Muhlenberg without our friend Coach Marino.  We were planning to join Frank and Carroll here in Naples, FL along with other friends in the condo occupied by Carolyn and Bob Buzzard for the 2011 playing of the Superbowl.  We have be doing this for a number of years and then the new of Frank&#8217;s death hit us.   We will miss him in the front row at Muhlenberg football games and other Muhlenberg functions.  Coach Marino was a giant of a man who held Muhlenberg as close to his heart as his own family.  He will be sorely missed and the college will have to work very hard to fill the gigiantic void he will leave.  He was a man admired by all whom he met and touch.  We extend to Carroll and his family our deepest sympathy on this very sad moment in all of our lives.<br />

				<div class="comment-body"><p>I was fortunate to know Frank both from my student days and as a colleague in the alumni office. When I was the alumni director, we used to laugh when he came to work in a dark pin-striped suit, because we knew that was his &#8220;hit suit&#8221; and he was going to talk to some potential big donors that day. The memorial service was a beautiful tribute to a generous, caring, amazingly successful, but self-effacing man. He will be missed by friends, family, and colleagues alike. Carroll, there was no way I was going to NOT make the trip &#8211; for you, Pam, Laura, and Clare.</p>

				<div class="comment-body"><p>Cher.  Madonna.  &#8220;Coach&#8221;.  One word, and everyone knows to whom we refer.  But unlike the first two, a lifetime of words cannot do justice to what he did with his life, what he did to encourage and inspire others, or how he made everyone he came in contact with a better human being.</p>
<p>I had the privilege of first meeting Coach in 1976 when my mother started working in the admissions office.  I was &#8220;kid&#8221; to Coach back then, and 10 years later when I graduated from Muhlenberg, I was honored to be &#8220;one of his boys&#8221;.  You didn&#8217;t have to be one of his players to be be &#8220;one of his boys&#8221; or one of his &#8220;kids&#8221;.  Coach made an incredible impact on thousands of students, parents, and alumni over his four decades at Muhlenberg.</p>
<p>The life of Frank Marino will live on at Muhlenberg forever.  Coach may be gone, but he will never, ever, be forgotten.  Mrs. &#8220;Coach&#8221;, Pam, Laura, and Clare, please know that everyone is thinking of you and your family at this difficult time.  Thank you for sharing him with us for so many years!  We are all better people for having Frank Marino in our lives.  &#8211;Chip and Sue Hurd</p>

				<div class="comment-body"><p>For the past two years, I have been blessed to have the best next door neighbors possible.  From the day I joined Muhlenberg College EMS in 2007, I was told about how &#8220;awesome&#8221; our neighbors are came to learn that though they may actually be the Marino&#8217;s, we are to call them Coach and Mrs. Coach.  Neighbors are good for a cup of milk, some eggs, maybe a roll of toilet paper, but the Marino&#8217;s are different.  They&#8217;re a shoulder to cry on, and a resource when life doesn&#8217;t seem to make sense.  Though I regretfully never took the time to really get to know them, I knew that if I was to ring that doorbell, I would be welcomed with open arms.<br />
Carol, If you need ANYTHING please let me know, I hope that I can be there for you as you have been there for me.  Oh and feel free to use our wireless internet all you wish.  Please call me when you read this, and know that when school resumes next week, we are having dinner, and I won&#8217;t take no for an answer.<br />
God Bless.<br />

				<div class="comment-body"><p>My family had a long relationship with Coach Marino beginning with my Mom&#8217;s long tenure as a nurse in the health office and of course during my four years as a student at Berg. He was a kind man and treated everyone with respect.  During my four years at Berg , Coach Marino never neglected to smile and offer a compliment. He often joked about how great I looked in glasses&#8211;Never get contact lenses was his sage advice. I smile about that 30 yrs later each time I choose a new pair of glasses. The generations to come will miss out on a fine mentor. We are keeping his family in our prayers.</p>

				<div class="comment-body"><p>While I was not one of Frank Marino&#8217;s athletes, as several have stated, that didn&#8217;t matter to Coach.  I came to know Coach through the Admissions office and various receptions I had the privilege to attend as a student representative of Muhlenberg.  All Coach needed to know was if you loved Muhlenberg &#8211; instant bond.  For so many students, parents, and athletes, Frank embodied the very best of Muhlenberg for so many years.  His warm smile will be sorely missed but those who knew him will always carry it in their hearts.</p>

				<div class="comment-body"><p>I too felt an overwhelming sense of loss at Frank&#8217;s passing, but a profound sense of gratitude at the same time for having had the privilege of knowing and working with him. </p>
<p>I know Frank had to be shaking his head at having to work not only with a 22-year-old kid, but one in a skirt, of all things, when it came time to talk football. Simply put, his kindness, his example, his brilliance at what he did, and, of course, his sense of humor when we all needed it most gave me the best start imaginable to my career. </p>
<p>When I coached softball for the Mules, what better example could I have followed than his? When I worked with the press, the public, alumni, colleagues and students, how could I have had any better model of what right looked like? For all the wonderful official accomplishments, however, the unofficial moments spoke just as loudly. </p>
<p>When Frank and I attended development staff meetings when both of us were also coaching, we would often sit next to each other. He would be sketching plays on his notepad, and I would occasionally reach over to move an &#8220;X&#8221; or &#8220;O.&#8221; I would be tinkering with a proposed batting order, and he would occasionally reach over to draw an arrow or add a name. All of this would be done with barely concealed giggles, which made me appreciate the advice all the more.</p>
<p> The full house at Frank&#8217;s beautiful and moving service this past Sunday was more of a testimonial to Frank than any of the plaques, trophies or game programs on display. The words of comfort and strength the participants offered were perfect, and brought Frank to vivid life in the hearts and minds of all present. Frank will live on so long as there is someone with Cardinal and Grey in his or her veins, and in the countless adoring and respectful memories of his many friends. </p>
<p>He lived for &#8220;his girls,&#8221; and took great pride in his wife, daughters and their accomplishments.My thoughts and prayers will remain with all of you in the difficult days to follow, along with my thanks for sharing him with us for so many wonderful years.</p>
<p>Most sincerely, Helen</p>

				<div class="comment-body"><p>Muhlenberg has lost one of its finest individuals.  Frank will always be Coach to me even though I never played for him.  You might say he is responsible for putting some thoughts in my father&#8217;s head to encourage me to attend Muhlenberg, a decision I never regretted.</p>
<p>He always shared with me words of support, motivation and a joke or two.  He would emphasize the positives in a defeat and the accomplishments in a victory.  He was never at a loss for the right words at the right time.  His smile was contageous and he instilled in us all a sense of pride to be a part of his &#8220;Berg family&#8221;.</p>
<p>I am saddened of his loss and will truly miss him, but am forever grateful to have known him.  May God bless the Marino family and for sharing Coach with us for so many years.</p>

				<div class="comment-body"><p>It has taken me a while to put together the thoughts I want to impart here but like so many of my brothers and sisters who played a sport for Coach the words &#8220;don&#8217;t embarrass the family&#8221; continue to ring the loudest for me.  There are so many great memories of Coach I can&#8217;t begin to put them all down.  He never met my children but he did meet my wife when I was fortunate to attend the dinner inducting John Sartori into the Muhlenberg Hall of Fame.  I&#8217;ll never forget how &#8220;Dorper&#8221; used to brag about his blocks more than any TD reception he ever caught and how coach just used to shake his head and laugh and say &#8220;there&#8217;s a guy who you want to play like.&#8221;.</p>
<p>I chose Muhlenberg because when all of the other coaches were promising that I would start my freshman year Coach promised me one thing &#8220;you will have the same chance as every other guy on the team.&#8221;   Ever since that time I have been to a number of small colleges in Western PA and other states and I always compare them to Muhlenberg.  Nothing compares&#8230;and now nothing ever will again.</p>
<p>I wish I would have had the chance to share my most recent successes with Coach but I know I will when we are together again in the Lord&#8217;s presence.  As I have told so many others when someone seems to be taken from us early, including my own dad, God felt that Frank had done what he came here to do and called him home early and Coach being the man he was never hesitated.</p>
<p>Miss you Coach.</p>
<p>PS Kyle Coach always knew it was Danny G who drew the Frank O Lantern!</p>

				<div class="comment-body"><p>I have often been proud of Muhlenberg College, but never prouder than the afternoon of January 9, 2011 as we &#8220;Celebrated the Life&#8221; of Frank Marino in our chapel.  It was &#8220;standing room&#8221; only as speaker after speaker told of Frank&#8217;s contribution to their lives.  I believe everyone in the large audience could have added more to the testimony of his good work.  </p>
<p>Frank understood the blessings of working hard for something larger than himself.  He labored every day for others.  He invested time and effort in people to help them progress in life.  His investments in people have produced many benefits for tomorrow and every day thereafter.  He seemed to be everywhere, never forgetting friends or where they lived.  Several years ago while traveling, I called my home in Florida &#8211; guess who was there, Frank and Carroll to take my wife to lunch.  The Ambassadors of life and people were everywhere.</p>
<p>His presence in many lives is obvious.  He was the first half of a perfect marriage not only to Carroll, but to all of us and Muhlenberg College.  My comments here are not intended to be a promotional plug for the Muhlenberg College family, but they could be.  We needed him and he needed us.  It is a shame we waited for his passing to realize, write, talk and celebrate what he meant to all.  It makes you wonder how such a humble, soft hearted man was so successful coaching a very violent sport.</p>
<p>There are many examples of his good humor and caring.</p>
<p>On January 5, 2011, after inquiring about Frank’s condition and after encouragement from Rich Romeo, I called the residence of Carroll and Frank at 4:20 PM to leave a message.  I was surprised when Carroll answered.  I said I was sorry Frank was not well.  She told me Frank had passed on at 3:00 PM.  I was shocked.  She was remarkably calm.  We spoke of how I had spent a lot of time with him weeks before at the Moravian football game.  She said I may have been the last person to spend that amount of time with him.  At the lunch prior to the game, he introduced me as usual to several friends as he had done many times before, “here is a guy who bleeds cardinal and grey”.  </p>
<p>As we left the President’s luncheon, his daughter took my card and noted again our telephone numbers.  She agreed to get us all together at the beach in New Jersey or in Florida.  We would get some dates soon.  </p>
<p>I rode with Dean Green to the game and sat with her in the Moravian Presidents seats for the first half.  As I made my way across the field during the intermission, Frank greeted me with a big smile and statement, “I had my eye on you over there – it didn’t seem natural.  You belong here.”  The “Frankism’s” continued.  I asked him to explain the makeup of a good football coach.  He was funny.  “All good football coaches complain”, “another year of poor recruiting”, “not enough assistants”, “opponents getting stronger”, “need more funding”, “our competitors keep improving their facilities etc.”  After which we both laughed and confessed that we would be happy to play even if we had no pads or helmets.  In the end, he confessed, “coaches all love their jobs and wouldn’t trade them for anything – it simply was the best.”  He said even though I never said it, he knew my dream job was to coach, so he concluded that “he had the best job – one I would have enjoyed”.  </p>
<p>Many times over our 30 years as friends, we had talked about commitment and people.  We agreed we had seen many commit, and when they did, things happened, followed by an abiding sense of accomplishment and a foundation to build a life upon.</p>
<p>He gave meaning to my belief that the True Test of Leadership is not to put greatness into people, because it was already there, the true test is to bring it forth into life.  He did that.</p>
<p>As you reflect on your relationship with Frank, remember what interest, help and encouragement can do for others.  His presence in our lives made us better.</p>
<p>Frank &#8211; thank you for being our friend.  Rest in peace.</p>

				<div class="comment-body"><p>Frank Marino was a man of integrity.  He was a man for other men in his profession to look up to.  He was a great encourager to me.  He was always upbeat and always wanted the best for my teams and all the other teams at Muhlenberg.  He was as loyal as a man can be to all he came in contact with.<br />
Frank and Carroll were the epitomy of the Christ-like love spouses are called to share with each other.  They too have set an example for all of us.  Personnally, I am a better person for knowing Frank Marino.<br />
                                                                                                      Sincerely,<br />
