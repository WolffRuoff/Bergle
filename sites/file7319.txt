								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> The term “ownership” in the relatively newly-developed, ever-evolving digital world we live in has begun to take on a different meaning. What was once based on sole physical possession of an item is now beginning to change as the digital world continues to develop and mature.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> It seems there is no such thing as full-ownership in the digital world anymore. Everything we obtain online is essentially just a lease – a lease granting us access to use, borrow, share, and explore. Nothing is truly owned. We are simply claiming something as our own for a specified period of time; however, it is never really ours.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Similar to what occurs in the real world, these possessions can easily be taken away. We can lose licenses and have access revoked to materials because we do not have genuine authority over the content. Which raises several questions. Who really has authority over such material? Who truly owns these products and services? What can be changed to grant us ownership over the content we seek to take ownership of?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> The concept of ownership online is a shady one. There are many complexities associated with it due to the very fact that we do not know who rightly owns the content or material. As Sian Lindley mentioned in her TedTalk, Rethinking ownership in the digital age, we do not know where the borders lie when it comes to our own digital ownership.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Since we often confuse access with ownership and possession we find ourselves giving up rights to large corporations who operate solely for-profit. We are given some control over what we can post and what we decide to share. Realistically, we are deprived of much more in the way of control or protection of our online content. If we try to relinquish ownership we do so with an expectation in can be easily done, since the page is no longer accessible to others eyes. However, because we never truly had ownership the corporation, who is the real owner, still maintains the final decision with respect to what actually becomes of that content.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When one thinks of copyright law they automatically associate it with a positive. Copyright law was created with the intention of doing right by the public, encouraging self-expression and further promoting the artistic creativity of the public. However, when we begin to look deeper into the law as opposed to viewing it from the surface we begin to see a lot of gray-area evolve, diminishing much of the positive aspects of such law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Today, we are living in a digital world, with a large portion of our lives residing online. With this change one begins to wonder who is protecting our rights in this new world? Are copyright laws thorough enough to address the issues that arise in this new world, and are they efficient enough to take a real stand on the issue of infringement?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The concern associated with copyright laws have been a long time running, and this new world has only exasperated these problems. It appears copyright law has not been able to appropriately keep up with these changes due to the complex and costly legal procedures usually associated with such. This has only further restrained one’s creative expression. Essentially, the matter of copyright law and fair use is subjective. Everything is on a “case-by-case” basis, and as a small player going up against large established company you find yourself fighting an uphill battle that does not appear to be worth the time or money expended. In agreement with Professor Merges “creativity should not be stifled by litigation;” however, on the contrary the law does need to be adjusted to reflect what Mr. Efroni considers the “practical realities of modern life and technological advancements.” The law needs to be looked at objectively, without consideration for profit, modified appropriately, and then enforced in a nonpartisan manner. Copyright law is extremely important to preserving the public’s right to self-expression and continued ownership of individual ideas and ongoing steps need to be taken to maintain these rights.</span></p>
