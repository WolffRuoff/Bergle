<p>This is a rematch of a 2010 Centennial Conference semifinal, won by Muhlenberg 4-0. In last year&#8217;s regular-season meeting, the teams played to a 1-1 draw.</p>
<p>Both teams are aiming to return to the playoffs in what is shaping up as a six-team race for five spots. Muhlenberg and F&amp;M are in a three-way tie with Dickinson for fourth place with four CC games remaining.</p>
<p>The Mules (7-3-1, 3-2) are ranked third in the Mid-Atlantic Region by the National Soccer Coaches Association of America; the Diplomats (7-3-2, 3-2) are fourth. The two CC losses for both teams are by one goal to Swarthmore and Johns Hopkins.</p>

<p><strong>Football at Gettysburg (Saturday, 1:00)</strong></p>
<p>The Mules (3-2, 3-1) return from their bye to take on one of the top offenses in Division III. The Bullets (3-2, 3-1) are averaging 552.4 yards per game (first in Division III) and 47.8 points per game (second in Division III). Gettysburg also is allowing 42.2 points per game, and Muhlenberg has scored at least 30 points in all three of its wins. The Mules&#8217; two losses are to undefeated teams ranked in the top 15 in Division III.</p>

			<p><em>The members of the Muhlenberg volleyball team didn&#8217;t have any classes on Tuesday morning because of Fall Break, but they still spent time in the classroom &#8211; reading to a third-grade class at Sacred Heart Regional School. Senior Brooke McQueen wrote about the experience:</em></p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/comm_service1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-302" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/comm_service1.jpg" alt="" width="678" height="239" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/comm_service1.jpg 678w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/comm_service1-300x105.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/comm_service1-500x176.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 678px) 100vw, 678px" /></a>Today the Muhlenberg volleyball team went to Mr. Jim Millets&#8217; third-grade classroom in the Sacred Heart Regional School and read stories. Our team arrived to a classroom bustling with excited third-graders, waiting eagerly to meet the team. We introduced ourselves and told the kids where we were from. Morgan Duggan, Lindsey Gambocurta and Coach Yoder are from the area, and several kids nodded when they recognized their towns.</p>
<p>Mr. Millets has a display of hats in his classroom with one hat for every letter of the alphabet. His collection currently only contained high school hats with their letters. As a gift, we gave the third-graders their first college hat, a bright red “M” with the kicking mule. </p>
<p>Next, we all lined up and trooped across the street to the hall where we sat down to read. The team was lined up in front of the third-graders, and we took turns reading one page at <a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/comm_service2.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-303" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/comm_service2-300x174.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="174" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/comm_service2-300x174.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/comm_service2-500x290.jpg 500w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/comm_service2.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>a time to the students. We shared with them our favorite books about Halloween, which brought many laughs. Afterward, the third-graders asked us questions about ourselves as a team. My favorite question was asked by a little girl. She said “How do you guys win?” The whole team answered saying “With lots of practice and teamwork!”</p>
<p>The morning ended when the Muhlenberg volleyball team made a tunnel with our arms and the third-graders got to run through cheering! It was a great way for our team to get out into the greater Allentown community and give back. </p>

<div>Hynson hit .466 and averaged 3.63 kills per set to lead the Mules to road wins against Bryn Mawr and Washington. She had 18 kills in only 29 attempts against the Shorewomen, recording kills on seven consecutive hits and scoring four straight points in the pivotal second set. Her 18 kills were the most by the Muhlenberg freshman since 2002, and the two wins gave the Mules four in the CC (twice as many as they had all last year).</div>

He came in at halftime after Muhlenberg’s starting goalie was injured and made seven saves in a scoreless tie against New Jersey. He then became the first Mule goalie since 2001 to record a shutout in his first career start, stopping six shots in a 1-0 win at Washington.</div>

			<p>Due to Yom Kippur and football having a bye, the schedule is a little different this weekend, with only men&#8217;s cross country competing on Saturday.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-46" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="237" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee.jpg 350w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee-300x203.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" /></a>Field Hockey at Washington (Friday, 3:00)</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg puts its three-game winning streak up against another team on a streak. Washington, a Centennial Conference semifinalist last year, has won five in a row and is currently tied for third place in the CC with a 3-1 record. Muhlenberg is 2-3 as it heads into a challenging second half of its league schedule.</p>
<p>Homefield advantage hasn&#8217;t been an advantage in this series of late &#8211; the road team has won the last five meetings, and the Mules are 4-1 in their last five trips to Chestertown.</p>
<p>The teams have a common result against a common non-conference opponent, both having beaten Drew in overtime.</p>
<p>The rejuvenated Muhlenberg offense has scored at least three goals in three straight games for the first time since 2006; the last time the Mules did that in four straight was 2000.</p>

<p><strong>Volleyball at Washington (Friday, 5:00)</strong></p>
<p>The Mules (5-12, 3-2) look to extend their CC winning streak to three and match their overall win total from all of last season. Washington (9-8, 0-4) has lost six of eight after a 7-2 start. Muhlenberg leads the all-time series 16-2, but one of the Shorewomen&#8217;s wins came last year.</p>

			<p>The first few months of college can be difficult for incoming freshmen. They have to adjust to life without their parents; classes are more challenging; and of course there’s the dread of no longer having someone to do the laundry.</p>
<p>As if that’s not enough, the freshmen on the Muhlenberg field hockey and volleyball teams have also added “helping turn a team around” to their already long list of new responsibilities.</p>
<p>Both teams struggled through down seasons last fall but have shown great improvement this year. Field hockey has already won more games than all of last season, while volleyball has surpassed its Centennial Conference win total from a year ago with half of the conference season still to play.<a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/thies2.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-254" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/thies2.jpg" alt="" width="340" height="353" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/thies2.jpg 340w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/thies2-288x300.jpg 288w" sizes="(max-width: 340px) 100vw, 340px" /></a></p>
<p>And a big reason for both resurgences has been the play of freshmen.</p>
<p>For field hockey, freshmen have accounted for 10 of 16 goals, led by Kayleigh Thies <em>(right)</em> who is first on the team with seven goals and 17 points. She is also the top scoring freshman in the conference. Three other freshmen, Heather Porrini (two goals), Christine Germaske (one goal, one assist) and Allison Califano (one assist)  have also scored this fall, and keeper Sierra Lenker made six saves to get the win in her first career start against Widener.</p>
<p>But more than just stats, the newcomers have helped change the mentality of the team, according to junior Kristen Dornenburg.</p>
<p>The difference was evident from the first day of practice, she said, adding the 14-member freshman class brought a strong sense of aggressiveness that has pushed older players for their starting spots. The result has been a team that plays with more fire both during practice and in games.</p>
<p>“You could tell we were a lot more competitive going against each other when preseason started,” Dornenburg said. “We’re all fighting for positions every day in practice, and if we’re not competitive, we’re not going to play. So I think that’s what you see the freshmen have brought. Everyone has to fight for their position, and that’s raised our level as a team.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/hynson2.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-255" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/hynson2.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="497" /></a>For volleyball, five rookies see regular time. Alyssa Schell leads the team with 170 digs, while Nikki Dickson is tied for the lead with 21 aces and is second with 172 assists. Holly Hynson <em>(left)</em> ranks third on the squad with 96 kills, and Julia Elkin (80 digs, nine aces) and Lindsey Gambocurta (50 kills, nine aces) have also been solid contributors.</p>
<p>The youthful influx has also given some of the veteran players a chance to play their normal positions, which didn’t always happen last fall when the Mules were hampered by injuries and forced to move players around in order to field a full lineup.</p>
<p>“Instead of trying to have everyone play somewhere just so we can have six people on the court, there’s people specialized in every spot playing their natural positions,” senior Brooke McQueen said. “Now that we have people with the talent at the right spots the court, we’re a lot more comfortable and playing a lot better. That has been one of the big differences this year.”</p>
<p>The freshmen have also been welcomed additions outside of games and practices, as well. Volleyball senior Jackie Price said the team has the feel of a family, with the three seniors taking the freshmen under their wings.</p>
<p>But at the same time, the newcomers have brought a sense of fun to the team, which includes plenty of singing, dancing and joking on the way to and from games, and at dinner after practice.</p>
<p>And the way this season has gone, there may be even more wins for both teams to sing and dance about before the year is done.</p>
<p>“They’re just as goofy and crazy as the rest of us,” Price said with a laugh. “We’re welcoming them with open arms, and they’ve seriously made a great impact on our team this year.</p>
<p>“We’re working so well together; everyone knows their role. They have been a great addition to the team, and I am just so proud of them all.”</p>

			<p>Is it October already? Indeed it is, and the Mules teams begin the second half of their 2011 seasons on a weekend filled with home events.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-104" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="237" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg 350w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1-300x203.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" /></a>Volleyball vs. Dickinson (Saturday, 11:00)</strong></p>
<p>The Mules dig playing at home. In their last four matches at Memorial Hall, they defeated Albright and McDaniel and were very competitive with strong Moravian and Haverford teams. Now they’ll try to even their Centennial Conference record against 2-10 Dickinson.</p>
<p>The Mules also dig pediatric cancer research. Muhlenberg volleyball and the Centennial Conference are working together this year to raise money for Tanner&#8217;s Touch, a non-profit organization out of Westminster, Md., that raises awareness and funds to support pediatric cancer research. The Mules (who also play Mount St. Mary at 3:00) will collect pledges and donations for every dig they record in the match against Dickinson.</p>

			<p><em>Last Friday, 45 Muhlenberg College students presented at the Science Summer Research Poster Session, a culmination of their summer work. Each on-campus summer science research student was awarded an 8-10 week stipend supported by either internal College grants, some external funding or generous alumni.</em></p>
<p><em>Among those presenting were five athletes.  We asked them about their research projects and life as a student-athlete.</em></p>
<p><strong>Michael Baer, Track &amp; Field</strong> (A Possible Role for nhr-239 in Sensory Response)</p>
<p><em><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/baer.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-220" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/baer.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="287" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/baer.jpg 500w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/baer-300x172.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a>Describe your research project.</em> I study feeding behavior in the nematode C. elegans. Specifically, I am working on uncovering the function of a poorly studied gene, nhr-239, because when we delete this gene the nematodes show a different feeding pattern. Right now we think that this change has to do with oxygen sensation.</p>
<p><em>Why did you choose this topic? </em>I originally joined Dr. Wightman&#8217;s lab because genetics is a field of study that I find very interesting and may continue to study in the future. I enjoy my topic because of all the unknowns present. Our lab is the first to work on the function of nhr-239.</p>
<p><em>What did it mean to you to be named an Academic All-American last year? </em>Being named an Academic All-American last year was a great honor, especially since athletics and academics are the largest parts of my life at Muhlenberg. I&#8217;ve always viewed myself as a student-athlete, which made this award such an honor for me.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki Cronin and Nate Crossette, Cross Country/Track &amp; Field</strong> (Calibrations for High Energy Physics)</p>
<p><em><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/crossette.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-221" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/crossette.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="310" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/crossette.jpg 490w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/crossette-300x189.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/crossette-474x300.jpg 474w" sizes="(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px" /></a>Describe your research project.</em> (NIcki) We were studying the properties of the quark gluon plasma, which was created from the collisions of gold nuclei. This interests us because it recreates the conditions microseconds after the big bang and we are interested studying these properties of the early universe. Specifically, we worked with a detector called the Muon Piston Calorimeter and calibrating its response to the photons it detected from the pi zero decays.</p>
<p>(Nate) The Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), a particle collider in Long Island, is powerful enough to create a quark gluon plasma, the hottest known matter in the universe, when it smashes gold nuclei together at great enough speeds. Detectors surrounding the collision make measurements by detecting particles that were created when the plasma cools and expands. My contribution to the research collaboration at RHIC was to help calibrate the Muon Piston Calorimeter, a subsystem of a detector, using computer simulations and collision data.</p>
<p><em>Why did you choose this topic?</em> (Nate) I chose this research because when asked what I want to do with physics, I don’t have an answer. I want to find an answer to that question. My favorite part of this experience was learning how to write computer code that models physical phenomena.</p>
<p><em>What did you enjoy most about it? </em>(Nicki) This was an area of physics that I had never explored before and I truly learned a lot in the process about nuclear and particle physics as well as computer programming. It was an amazing and unique experience to not only be able to work with other students from Muhlenberg, but with physicists from around the world who have been doing research like this for years.</p>
<p><em>Do you take more pride in your athletic achievements or your academic achievements?</em> (Nicki) Personally, I take more pride in my academic achievements. Athletics is a good addition in my life, I love running with my team and it helps keep me balanced, but ultimately, it is my academics that is going to take me where I want to be in life. For me, academics is the number one priority.</p>
<p><em>Is it more challenging to understand physics or run an 8K in the mud?</em> (Nate) Understanding physics and running an 8k through the mud are both fun, yet challenging in opposite ways. Running is simple, so it’s very easy to overcomplicate. During a race, the challenge is to focus on telling your body to relax and run faster, even when you are very tired. Physics is really complicated, so the challenge is thinking of scenarios that demonstrate physics principles in a way that makes it easy to understand while not oversimplifying. I don’t think I could pick which one is harder. I enjoy both.</p>
<p><strong>Melissa Ugelow, Cross Country/Track &amp; Field</strong> (Tailoring Porous Silicon for Analyte Response)</p>
<p><em><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/ugelow.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-222" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/ugelow.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="321" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/ugelow.jpg 500w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/ugelow-300x192.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/ugelow-467x300.jpg 467w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a>Describe your research project.</em> My research this summer focused on assessing and characterizing porous silicon and its sensing properties. The ultimate goal of the project is to be able to tailor the surface of porous silicon for analyte response.  </p>
<p><em>What did you enjoy most about it?</em> What I enjoyed the most about this topic was that it was so new to me.  I was able to learn so many new analytical techniques and use new instruments.  </p>
<div><em>How do you balance being a year-round athlete with being a chemistry major?</em> Sometimes it is hard to balance being a chemistry major with sports all year round but I have been very lucky that all of my professors have been very understanding and helpful. All the chemistry professors leave their office doors open and want you to ask them questions if you need help. Sometimes it is difficult to balance the workload with the practice and meet schedule, but I think that if I did not run, I would not be as focused and motivated as I am now.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>Erica Wenzel, Volleyball/Softball</strong> (POGIL Patterns: Indentifying &amp; Documenting Effective Elements &amp; Practices)</div>
<div> </div>
<div><em><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/wenzel.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-223" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/wenzel.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="330" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/wenzel.jpg 500w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/wenzel-300x198.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/wenzel-454x300.jpg 454w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a>Describe your research project. </em>Over the summer, I worked with Dr. Kussmaul on researching patterns in POGIL (process oriented guided inquiry learning) activities. I analyzed the questions of the activities to determine what types of questions followed each other and then created another set of patterns, which would be used in future research.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><em>What did you enjoy most about it?</em> I am extremely grateful to get this experience. The part I liked the most was learning about POGIL and how to implement it in the classroom.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><em>What are some of the qualities you learn as an athlete that help you as a student? </em>Two important qualities I learned through athletics are time management and responsibility. As an athlete, you need to manage homework, studying, practices and games. It&#8217;s not always easy, but its important to stay on top of school as well as sports. Being on a team is a big responsibility. You have to look out for your teammates, make sure everything is ready for practice/games, and you need to take responsibility for your schoolwork if you are missing class due to a game as well.  Both of these qualities will be extremely helpful after college.</div>

<p>Two of the three teams that tied for the Centennial Conference title, and two of the three teams that are off to 2-0 starts this year, square off in a key game in Baltimore.</p>
<p>Johns Hopkins is ranked 23rd in Division III and has outscored its three opponents 142-21. Muhlenberg, which received votes in the American Football Coaches Association poll, is coming off a dramatic comeback win against McDaniel in which it scored 27 points in the fourth quarter to win, 34-26.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg leads the series 23-19-1 and has won three of the last four meetings, including two at Homewood Field. Seven of the last eight meetings were decided by eight points or fewer.</p>
<p>Turnovers could play a big role in this game. The Mules are plus-9 in turnovers this year and picked off JHU quarterback Hewitt Tomlin four times in both 2008 and 2010.</p>

<p><strong>Women&#8217;s Soccer at Johns Hopkins (Saturday, 7:00); at Stevenson (Sunday, 2:00)</strong></p>
<p>Coming off a tie against 24th-ranked Haverford, the Mules take on another nationally ranked opponent: No. 7 Johns Hopkins, the six-time defending Centennial Conference champion. Each of the last two years, the Mules beat the Blue Jays when they were ranked in the top 10, and in 2008 Muhlenberg took No. 7 Johns Hopkins to double overtime.</p>

			<p>It doesn’t get much better than this – Homecoming weekend, fall in the air, and lots of great matchups at Muhlenberg.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-46" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee-300x203.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="203" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee-300x203.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Football vs. McDaniel (Saturday, 2:00)</strong></p>
<p>The actual game may not be as marquee as the matchup between Green Terror back Joe Rollins and the Mule defense. Rollins rushed for 311 yards against Moravian last week, and Muhlenberg has allowed only 1.9 yards per carry through two games. This is the only Centennial Conference game this week between two teams that won their league openers.</p>

			<p>There’s a new way to keep close tabs on not just the Muhlenberg teams, but all Division III teams in football, soccer and field hockey.</p>
<p>Starting this week, box scores for all Division III contests in those sports will be available on the NCAA website. The NCAA has been doing this with Division I football for several years and started with Division III last year. Soccer and field hockey were added this year, with volleyball to come in the future.</p>
<p>Here are the links:</p>
<p>Football: <a href="http://web1.ncaa.org/mfb/mainpage.jsp?year=2011">http://web1.ncaa.org/mfb/mainpage.jsp?year=2011</a></p>
<p>Men’s soccer: <a href="http://web1.ncaa.org/stats/StatsSrv/rankings?sportCode=MSO">http://web1.ncaa.org/stats/StatsSrv/rankings?sportCode=MSO</a></p>
<p>Women’s soccer: <a href="http://web1.ncaa.org/stats/StatsSrv/rankings?sportCode=WSO">http://web1.ncaa.org/stats/StatsSrv/rankings?sportCode=WSO</a></p>
<p>Field hockey: <a href="http://web1.ncaa.org/stats/StatsSrv/rankings?sportCode=WFH">http://web1.ncaa.org/stats/StatsSrv/rankings?sportCode=WFH</a></p>
<p>The football page is set up a little differently, but for the other three, click on “Click here for box scores and complete team and individual statistics.” Although it is listed on the Division I line, you can get to all three divisions from there. Select III from the drop-down menu where I appears, and you get a list of all schools that play the sport. Click on any school, and you can see their links to cumulative stats and game boxes. Click on a player name in the roster to see season and career stats.</p>
<p>If you want to check up on upcoming opponents, this is an alternative to going to their school websites. And if nothing else, it&#8217;s a great way to kill some time poring over stats.</p>
<p>The NCAA continues to provide weekly rankings in these sports, as well as volleyball (<a href="http://web1.ncaa.org/stats/StatsSrv/rankings?sportCode=WVB">http://web1.ncaa.org/stats/StatsSrv/rankings?sportCode=WVB</a>). Although it is way too early to put any stock in national statistical rankings, it is interesting to note that the Muhlenberg football team is 28<sup>th</sup> in Division III in rushing defense after two games, and Joe Rollins of McDaniel, who will be visiting Scotty Wood Stadium on Saturday, is the second-leading rusher in the division.</p>
