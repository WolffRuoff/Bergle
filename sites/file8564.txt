								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Without a doubt, technology has made an incredible impact on the lives of young adults in such an extensive amount of ways. Additionally, &#8220;technology has certainly transformed our libraries. Public Internet access is available at almost every public library, even the smallest and most rural&#8221; (Walter &amp; Myers, 2003, p.50). Young adults have grown up in such a rapidly changing technological era that they automatically expect to see computers when they visit the library, and librarians in return expect to see teens actively using the computers. A recent study funded by the Pew Charitable Trust found that at least 78% of all young people between the ages of twelve and seventeen go online for school or personal use (Walter &amp; Myers, 2003). The number of homes with computers and Internet access has grown significantly over the last several years so much to the point that students themselves are concerned about the digital divide. At times, it can be difficult to be forced to rely on home computers for school assignments, and computers may not always be adequate for purposes of certain assignments (Walter &amp; Myers, 2003).</p>
<p>In an effort to try to keep up with the constant developments of new technologies, public libraries have started providing technologically savvy homework helpers who can accommodate teens&#8217; need for information and their preference for digital media. Young adults have found that the Internet not only assists with communication amongst friends and family, but they also feel that the Internet gives them a broader voice (Walter &amp; Myers, 2003). &#8220;Through electronic discussion lists and chat rooms, they can speak and listen to a far more diverse community than they can in their own geographical neighborhoods&#8221; (Walter &amp; Myers, 2003, p.50).</p>
<p>Since the Internet provides users with unlimited access to information, it is so important to be careful of how you use the Internet. As mentioned in several Ted Talks and in articles discussed in class in regards to privacy, especially now in the digital age, it is becoming more important than ever to be cognizant of what you are searching, downloading, and signing up for. With that in mind, young adults deserve the right to prove themselves as being responsible Internet users until a problem occurs. The Internet is such a useful, convenient, tool, it just needs to be used for appropriate purposes.</p>
