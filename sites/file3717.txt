<p style="text-align: left">http://www.rbr.com (2011, Feb 15). &#8220;Sirius XM not feeling threatened by Pandora.&#8221; <em>RBR Business Report</em>.Retrieved from<a href="http://www.rbr.com/radio/sirius-xm-not-feeling-threatened-by-pandora.html"> http://www.rbr.com/radio/sirius-xm-not-feeling-threatened-by-pandora.html</a></p>
<p>Because Pandora is trying to increase profit through IPO investors within Wall Street, people are beginning to ask if Sirius XM Radio is starting to feel threatened by this online <em>free</em> radio station.  But the CEO, Mel Karmizin, speaks out, saying that he feels no threat due to the fact that if indeed Pandora starts growing and making profit, they will increase in advertisements, almost making their station equal to those of terrestrial radio.  Terrestrial radio is AM and FM, so Karmizin gives radio commercialization a negative tone.  Who would want their Pandora station to be like that of terrestrial radio?  That means even more commercial interruption between songs, meaning more waiting for listeners when they thought Pandora would be the station to give them quick music when they want it.  Therefore, Pandora, and other free online radio stations, are no threat to Karmizin and his Satellite radio.</p>

<p>Commercials are not related at all to Sirius, they get their money through subscription.  Growth in subscription is showing that in future revenue, Sirius does not look like they will be facing any financial problems.  They have hundreds of channels that differ from music, talk shows, and comedy channels.  Karmizin is completely confident that his business will not fall to free internet radio. In relation to the IP (Internet Protocol) audio content of the article, Karmizin said that if it is what his subscribers want, he will do what he can to satisfy them.  The IP content is what internet users like most when they go to their radio stations online.  Streaming is fast, and they can avoid having break ups from Satellite.  But, if Sirius needs to make their content quicker, Karmizin will find a way, but still making profit through subscription.</p>
