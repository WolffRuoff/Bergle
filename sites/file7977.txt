					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;This was very interesting to read because you had the same ideas. He did express the importance of reading to help with writing. I also remember my mom saying that to me when I was little but I never believed her until recently and this class and the more I read the more I believed my writing got better and helped me find more inspiration for it. I like the quote you choose for the finally paragraph because I do also believe that that was the main point of the article.&lt;/p&gt;
