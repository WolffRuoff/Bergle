This necessitates a change in the way you log in from off-campus (no login is required on campus). For example, if you click on Academic Search Premier or WorldCat or any other library subscription database remotely, you will be presented with this\u00a0<strong><span style=\"color: #000000\"><a href=\"https:\/\/login.muhlenberg.idm.oclc.org\/login\">screen<\/a><\/span><\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>As prompted, use your first and last name without a space as the Login ID. Use your campus network password\/muhlenberg email password as the password to get into the databases.<\/p>\n<p>If you do not remember you network login\/password, contact the OIT Faculty\/Staff Support Desk at (484)664-3566, or e-mail the OIT Faculty\/Staff Support Desk at support@muhlenberg.edu.<\/p>\n<p>For other questions regarding access to library databases, please contact the library front desk: 484-664-3500 or refdesk@muhlenberg.edu.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>Upcoming NITLE Webinar on MOOCs<\/strong><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Free to Muhlenberg faculty:<\/p>\n<p>Title: Digital Pedagogy and MOOCification<br \/>\nDate: Tuesday, February 26, 4:00 &#8211; 5:30 pm EST<br \/>\nLocation: Hosted online via NITLE&#8217;s videoconferencing platform<br \/>\nDetails:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.nitle.org\/live\/events\/162-digital-pedagogy-and-moocification\">http:\/\/www.nitle.org\/live\/events\/162-digital-pedagogy-and-moocification<\/a><\/p>\n<p>What do MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) have to offer liberal arts colleges? Even if we don&#8217;t agree that the MOOC can be a viable educational form, can we outline useful pedagogical practices that MOOCs inspire? Seminar leaders Jesse Stommel and Sean Michael Morris define MOOCification as &#8220;a pedagogical approach inspired by MOOCs that is unleashed in an otherwise closed or small-format course.&#8221; This seminar will investigate the techniques that MOOCs point toward that can be used in face-to-face, hybrid, and online classrooms, no matter the scale.<\/p>\n<p>The last 30 minutes will include an interactive experiment that takes participants out into the web, in a sense, bringing the seminar into the MOOC space.<\/p>\n<p>This seminar may be especially interesting to faculty, instructional technologists, librarians, and others interested in digital pedagogy, curious about MOOCs, and invested in collaborative learning.<\/p>\n<p>Registration link:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.nitle.org\/registrations\/sa\/022613.php\">http:\/\/www.nitle.org\/registrations\/sa\/022613.php<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>New Library Books Added in Fall 2012<\/strong><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Here is a\u00a0<strong><span style=\"color: #000000\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.muhlenberg.edu\/library\/NEWBOOKSFALL2012-13SCUTTLEBUTTEDITION.xls\">list of new books<\/a><\/span><\/strong>\u00a0added to the library in fall of 2012.
