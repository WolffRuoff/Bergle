(Non-edible support materials such as toothpicks are permitted but must be listed on the registration form).<\/p>\n<p>&#8211;Registration takes place on the day of the Festival. There will be an entry form to complete when you bring your submission.<\/p>\n<p>&#8212; You are welcome to display your book inspiration [or cover image] alongside your entry.<\/p>\n<p>&#8212; Entries must not need any additional care like refrigeration during the festival.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211;By entering, you give Trexler Library permission to photograph your entry, (and you, if you are a prize-winning entrant).<\/p>\n<p>&#8211;The Trexler Library Edible Book Festival planning committee reserves the right to reject any entry that they believe is unsuitable for the competition. (Nothing in poor taste, please!).<\/p>\n<p>&#8211;Entrants and guests are invited to share the tasting of the entries at the end of the Festival, but Trexler Library accepts no responsibility for the food safety of said items.
