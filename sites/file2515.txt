					<description><![CDATA[Great article here, Group 2!  You&#039;ve really hit on an interesting new trend: cloud music streaming.  As you note, the &quot;on demand&quot; aspect of this new form of distribution is likely to be quite threatening to the existing distributors and exhibitors in the radio industry.  The subscription revenue model is of course familiar from satellite radio, but these new entrants seem to be relying on the Internet for their distribution like Pandora.  Thanks for the interesting link!  APA style was just fine here.]]></description>
