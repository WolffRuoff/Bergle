It is important to allow individuals access to rare books so they can experience their craftsmanship and learn from them, expanding their appreciation and understanding of the past, and with this knowledge expand their participation in contemporary society. This talk will present research investigating human-rare historic book interaction in order to develop technology requirements for virtual reality renderings of rare books that enable integrated haptic, audio, olfactory, visual and cognitive human-rare book interaction.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Diane H.
