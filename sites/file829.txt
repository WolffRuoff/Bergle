Some 20-40 students attend at a time, getting a feel for what it&#8217;s like to conduct research at a college library.<\/p>\n<p>This year, on March 14, March 15, and April 3, students once again are scheduled to visit the library, learning from librarians about the various databases and the library catalog. They will gather resources and then begin work on their papers during their time here.<\/p>\n<p>Students who have visited Muhlenberg in the past report that this is one of the highlights of their high school experience, a chance to see what it&#8217;s like to be a college student, before college even begins.<\/p>\n<p>It should be noted that their experience would not be complete without a visit to the Dining Commons, where students enjoy the all-you-can eat experience right alongside Muhlenberg students.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>Readings to Accompany Center for Ethics Events<\/strong><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Scuttlebutt directs you to a collection of readings, mostly online, but some in print in the library, in support of the excellent programming offered by the Center for Ethics this semester, to aid in class discussions, and just for personal interest and edification:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong><span style=\"color: #000000\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.muhlenberg.edu\/library\/guides\/libinst\/ethics\/market_values\/sister_nora_nash.html\">Sister Nora Nash<\/a><\/span><\/strong>\u00a0(March 13)<br \/>\nResources by and about Sister Nora Nash, and the subject of corporate social responsibility.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #000000\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.muhlenberg.edu\/library\/guides\/libinst\/ethics\/market_values\/lawrence_lessig.html\">Lawrence Lessig<\/a><\/span><\/strong>\u00a0(April 15)<br \/>\nResources by and about Lawrence Lessig, and the subject of the Congressional corruption.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>Infomaniac<\/strong><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><em><strong>College and University Rankings<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p>Do you often find yourself befuddled by college and university rankings?
