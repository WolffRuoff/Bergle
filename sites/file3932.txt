And why should they when the DVR makes it so easy to avoid them?  But the Turner Company, a cable unit owned by the media conglomerate Time Warner, is developing a new strategy to save commercials from falling to their death (ouch!).  The company has undergone a four year effort to create a new kind of advertising strategy that will offer advertisers on the cable networks TBX, TNT, and True something that many others do not: a strong link between the commercial and the TV show that the consumers are viewing. The goal of this effort is to bring consumers back to commercials by making these ads relevant to the specific program and the specific audience.</p>
<p>Turner’s idea is similar to a technique that other networks have come up with, the technique of embedding show content within the commercial breaks.  We saw American Idol trying out this strategy with their “embedded auditions” that ran between commercials.  Networks and advertisers hoped that when viewers saw a flash of that familiar American Idol logo, they would stop fast-forwarding to see the show content, and, with any luck, see some other ads in the process.<span id="more-1155"></span></p>
<p>But the Turner Company’s strategy is a little different: instead of embedding show content into commercial breaks, the company proposes that advertisers work with Turner to create commercials that look or feel like a particular TV program, even though these spots are not actual show content.  The first step in this strategy is to identify particular moments or themes from the TV show that would seem to resonate with audiences or that serve as clear representations of the program.  The Turner Company uses the phrase “tagging” to describe the specific moments or themes that can be integrated into the commercials that will be viewed when the movie or television series is airing. Tuner Company’s thinking behind this tactic is that if the audience watches the television show or series, they must enjoy these themes or moments; therefore if these “tagged” themes are integrated into the commercials when the particular show or series is airing, consumers will be more likely to enjoy and watch the commercials.  So, if this strategy catches on, a company might develop an ad that features an attractive blonde singing in front of a panel of three (probably multi-racial/gender) judges to air during American Idol—it may not be an actual American Idol audition, but it looks like one, so audiences may be more inclined to watch the commercial.</p>
<p>Turner Company has hired several new employees to “tag” specific moments and themes in television series in the hopes of revamping television commercials. An inside source estimates that this new endeavor will cost Turner about a seven-figure sum amount. Linda Yaccarino, Vice President of Turner Entertainment ad sales states, “Such moves are absolutely critical to survival.”  This situation speaks to the enormous power of the client power role, or advertisers.   Turner, a cable distributor, is desperate to make TV attractive for advertisers, as cable networks rely largely on advertisers to make a profit.   As more and more consumers turn to online forms of media, television networks have to compete for advertiser dollars.  We have seen how this has impacted the print industries, which have either faltered or have been forced to go digital as a result of audience erosion and the resulting loss of advertisers.  The Turner Company does not want to suffer the same fate, so it is actively developing new ways to make its TV networks the hot place to advertise.  Plus, this new technique reflects the trend of audience segmentation: advertisers have always chosen to advertise during programs that draw an audience that would be interested in their products, but now there is even more of an opportunity to target an audience through an ad that is tailor-made for a specific audience.</p>
<p>It’s always a little troubling when the line between content creation and advertising gets blurred.  Turner’s mission is to help create commercials that complement television content, but it’s not a stretch to say that this relationship could become reciprocal with television creators creating content that complements commercials.  Or, television creators might be encouraged to dumb down their content so that it will be easier for advertisers to recycle this content in the form of an ad.</p>
<p>But with the incredible commercial zapping capability of DVRs, will the audiences even notice the change in commercials? Yaccarino is hopeful, stating, “A viewer could be ‘zooming through’ with a DVR, but if the advertising looks like the content the viewer tuned in to see in the first place, they may be trained to stop and watch it.” What are we dogs? We will see.</p>
