								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The post apocalyptic novel, <u>Brave New World</u> by Aldous Huxley, discusses how the misuse and abuse of technology can lead to the disintegration of creativity and independent thinking. Specific to Chapter Sixteen, Mustapha Mond provides the reader with more insight into his role as world controller and confronts Bernard, Helmholtz, and John the Savage about their looming fate of being removed from civilization due to their extensive knowledge. Mustapha Mond opens up about his past and reveals that he used to be a scientist himself, for he was given the same threat of being sent to an isolated island. Instead of removing himself from society, Mond became a world controller and since then has been conditioning his citizens to conform to various social classes, each one being emotionless, imprisoning, and filled with people who are constantly inebriated.</p>
<p>The key elements of this society are happiness and stability, for each social class is articulately devised to be content working on the tasks they are told to complete. For example, “Only an Epsilon can be expected to make Epsilon sacrifices, for the good reason that for him they aren’t sacrifices; they’re the line of least resistance” (Huxley, 1932). This medical intervention of human reproduction produces babies made to contribute to society in a specific way, there is no room for self discovery or liberty and everything has a prescribed method with no room for spontaneity. People are not able to freely express themselves, for their emotions are stripped away, leaving them in a constant state of “happiness”. But what is happiness if there is no unhappiness? Huxley parallels the themes of power and technology, for in the brave new world these go hand in hand. The government controls the technology and therefore, also the minds and actions of every person.</p>
<p>John argues with Mond over the concept of “old”, for John doesn’t understand why he’s the only person who appreciates Shakespeare and literature. Mond explains how when the past is beautiful, it takes people out of the present and more importantly, out of the future. People gain a basis of thought by looking back into the past. They are able to hear about the past, form an opinion about it, and decide how they want to proceed in the future. The old influences the new. It provokes collaboration, inspiration, and influences the way people think and creatively express themselves. Mond specifically points out how new scientific development leads to instability, for he believes that, “every discovery in pure science is potentially subversive; even science must sometimes be treated as a possible enemy&#8230;Science is dangerous; we have to keep it most carefully chained and muzzled.” (Huxley, 1932) This claim highlights Huxley’s growing dissatisfaction with government involvement in scientific and creative expression, for the more power a government has over technology and the human masses, the more corruption is prevalent. Objects, ideas, and discoveries that are old give people a sense of nostalgia, memory, and physical thought. Mond’s goal is to eliminate thinking and enforce the values of short term gratification provided by drugs, technology, and sex. Mond uses technology and hypnopaedic conditioning to breed these brainwashed, thoughtless people and design them to only want more, to only want new, to move from partner to partner in a mindless and routinely fashion. Huxley shines a light on this over-involvement of governmental policy on the human body to depict the consequences of what happens when the progression of science and art are tampered with. With a society blindly following the technology controlled by the government, manipulation pervades the mind of each individual and creates a mass of absentminded robots.</p>
