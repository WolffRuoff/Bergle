(2011, February 9 ). Paramount targeting Christian audiences with &#8216;Justin Bieber: Never Say   Never.&#8217; <em>Hollywood Reporter</em>. Retrieved from <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/paramount-targeting-christian-audiences-justin-97887" target="_blank">http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/paramount-targeting-christian-audiences-justin-97887</a></p>
<p>In case you have been living underneath a rock for the past two years, you have heard of &#8216;tween&#8217; singing sensation Justin Bieber. Attracting the hearts and minds of young girls in a way perhaps not seen since the heyday of &#8216;NSync and The Backstreet Boys, &#8220;Bieber fever&#8221; has covered the nation in a shockingly short amount of time. Aside from his millions of CDs sold, Paramount Pictures is hoping Bieber&#8217;s popularity will translate into cinematic success with this Friday&#8217;s release of the 3D &#8220;biopic-concert hybrid&#8221; <em>Justin Bieber: Never Say Never</em>. After the box office success of recent concert films like <em>Hannah Montana: Best of Both Worlds </em>(2008) and <em>Michael Jackson&#8217;s This Is It </em>(2009), studios have struck gold with this specific storytelling formula that attracts both film and music fans.</p>
<p>The trailer for the film can be viewed at this link:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COJCN3Mhr14">Never Say Never Official Trailer (HD)</a><span id="more-759"></span></p>
<p>A marketing technique that has gained prominence in the film industry in recent years involves targeting Christian religious communities. Recent successes of this technique have included Mel Gibson&#8217;s <em>The Passion of the Christ </em>(2004) and <em>The Blind Side </em>(2009). While <em>The Passion of the Christ</em> blatantly displayed its religious undertones and caused controversy as a result, <em>The Blind Side</em>&#8216;s thematic undertones of Christian beliefs brought a more subtle emphasis on faith and values. In an effort to appeal to Christians and religious groups, Paramount has recently held screenings of <em>Never Say Neve</em><em>r</em> for faith leaders and handed out spiritual discussion guides. According to an article in <em>The Hollywood Reporter</em>, these discussion guides makes the claim that the film &#8220;provides an opportunity to teach our children about the power of hope, prayer, faith and family.&#8221; One pastor who attended a screening of the film echoed this, saying that he wants to use the film as a discussion facilitator of &#8220;how authority and responsibility go hand in hand.&#8221;</p>
<p><!--more-->While it remains to be seen how well <em>Justin Bieber: Never Say Never</em> will perform at the box office, Paramount is hoping to expand its audience beyond a core market of tween girls. By targeting family-oriented groups through emphasizing the film&#8217;s religious aspects, the studio&#8217;s marketing team is praying for heavenly financial returns.</p>
