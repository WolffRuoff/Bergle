								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Facebook is a social networking service that was founded on February 4<sup>th</sup>, 2004, by Mark Zuckerberg with his Harvard College roommates Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes. The underlying purpose of Facebook was not only to connect each and every individual within our society but to link the information within it as well. Facebook did accomplish this goal but little did our society know how drastic of an impact this net working site would have towards our relationships with the individuals around us. Facebook not only gave us the ability to connect to one another but it also gave us the capability to weaken our real life relationships. This study, published by the Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, was founded by a survey of 582 responses gathered via Twitter on the factors that predicted whether someone would avoid a person who unfriended them.</p>
<p>With just a click of a button we were given the power to ultimately, terminate or create new connections. At first, this was an extremely elementary and unmeaningful act that demonstrated no true expression towards the accuracy of emotions felt between two individuals. But as Facebook grew, so did the level of its power towards depicting how we view each and every relationship that we currently found ourselves in. Still, many don’t realize the harsh impact that we find ourselves with when unfriending someone on Facebook, which is why social networking can lead to a wide variety of issues. “People think social networks are just for fun,” says study author Christopher Sibona, a doctoral student in computer science and information systems. Although one could pose an argument as to the very little weight social media plays in our society when viewing it from a certain aspect, there is also an extreme drawback within this idea. When two individuals are connected by anything, that certain “connector” contains much more emotional weight then it may appear. If each individual finds the same level of importance within that certain “connector” then the relationship between them will be at an adequate level of understanding. However, if one individual within that particular relationship seems to hold more importance then the other, it will be difficult for each of them to understand each other from an emotional stand point. This misunderstanding, then, seems to creep away from its social networking origins and finds the ability to stem into real world consequences. Sibona found that “40% of people surveyed said that they would avoid in real life anyone who unfriended them on Facebook. Some 50% said they would not avoid the person who unfriended them, and the remaining 10% were unsure”. So within a single click clutches the emotional influence to not only terminate a relationship in the digital world but the real world as well. But this isn’t Facebooks fault. Its original purpose was to connect individuals to one another. The fault must be bestowed within each user who consists in this site due to the fact that they create and set the standard of significance that each online “friendship” can carry into the real world. Social media is strictly what the user choses to make of it.</p>
<p>Within the writings of this article, Sibona found six main factors that predicted whether the termination within each friendship would remain on a digital level or carry over in the real world. One of the 6 factors Sibona found was, “If the person discussed the event after it happened”. So if the individual that part took within the act of unfriending found the need to make a real world reinforcement of their particular termination towards any individual it would then lead to a total halt of the friendship. Another factor Sibona found was, “How strong the person valued the relationship before the unfriending.” So this unprecedented standard that Facebook seems to establish from an emotional standpoint plays a major role in how substantial the value of the unfriending may turn out to be. Illustrating that although Facebook connects us, it may not necessarily connect us in all the right ways due to the actuality within the sites importance. One could argue, “It’s best to not look into these small actions found within our many social networking sites”, but its safe to say that we have reach a certain level of aptitude towards the power these sites play in our culture and throughout our society.</p>
<p>Instead of trying to fight these changes that we are seeing with the role of social networking in our society, we should accept them. For some, this idea may be foreign but eventually they will have no other choice. Social media has already taken its toll on so many different audiences throughout our society. “Americans now spend about 25% of their time online using social networks like Facebook, which has over a billion members”, so for our society to be able to interact and understand each other on an emotional level that existed during the time before these social media sites were born, we must understand them and subside to their values. “Online interactions have their own rules, language, and etiquette”. How could we as a society interact if we all didn’t speak the same language? These sites must be enlightened to those who don’t completely understand the morals engraved within them. The toll that could be taken on each individual can climb higher then an emotional level. “People who are unfriended may face similar psychological effects&#8230;because unfriending may be viewed as a form of social exclusion”. So a tool that was created to socially include each and every individual into a worldwide community is now being justified as the reason certain individuals feel excluded. This goes back to this idea of the miscommunication of the prominence of these sites.</p>
<p>The crucial notion that this article illustrates is the idea that social media won’t halt just because a certain portion of our society hasn’t adapted to the level of adequacy portrayed within its digital background. Social media will continue to impact our relations and not only will it linger but it will continue to flourish within our society. The sooner we begin to understand theses numerous social media sites, the sooner we will understand how to use these tools to their full potential, creating an efficient ideology within the role these sites will play throughout our culture.</p>
