			</h1>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Hey all! I thought it was about time we starting defining things. You&#8217;ll hear some of these terms in the play, so consider these additional or alternate definitions:</p>
<p>Intersectionality is the idea that all of our identities inform our life experience, and that the way they interact is unique for every person. As an example, I&#8217;m a white Jewish male. So my experience would be different than a white Christian male&#8217;s even though we are both white men. The same goes for any aspect of identity: sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, you name it.</p>
<p>Another really important thing to take away is the fact that these multiple identities might mean that you have power in some facets of your life, but don&#8217;t in others. Continuing with me as an example, I have a lot of social power because I&#8217;m white, but the fact that I&#8217;m Jewish means that I&#8217;m also part of a historically oppressed minority group, and I lack power because of that.</p>
<p>However, do not take this to mean that a black male&#8217;s experience is equal to a white female&#8217;s experience. It isn&#8217;t as easy and mathematical as that (trust me, I&#8217;m a math major).</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll continue to talk about it throughout the year, so this is merely a heads-up. See y&#8217;all soon!</p>

			<p>This past Tuesday was our first time performing in front of an audience.  The audience consisted of current Muhlenberg students who will be facilitating the discussions that will be held after each show for the Freshmen this weekend.  Yesterday, Wednesday, however, was our first performance in front of freshmen.  It was a very specific freshmen group &#8211; the athletes &#8211; and overall I think it went very well!</p>
<p>Personally, I found there to be a noticeable difference between the two performances.  The first one found the audience responding with laughter to some of the lines in our script, much more so than the second performance.  This isn&#8217;t necessarily a good or bad thing but there was definitely a difference and I think this difference is important in the ensemble&#8217;s understanding of who exactly our audience this weekend will be.</p>
<p>The facilitators in the first performance were all upperclassmen and also students who have either been in the Diversity Project in previous years or are already involved in these sorts of conversations on diversity in some way.  Basically they are &#8220;on the inside&#8221;, they already know and understand, to some extent, the issues of diversity that are happening on our campus currently.   The freshmen athletes were &#8220;on the outside&#8221;, meaning that this was, for the most part, the first time they were introduced to this subject matter and the accompanying issues.  This explains why some of the &#8220;hilarity&#8221; wasn&#8217;t as easily visible for them because they don&#8217;t quite understand as they had yet a chance to participate in such discussions .  Although some of us in the Diversity Project first thought this lack of responsiveness to be synonymous to iciness and not being receptive, we later discovered from the facilitators that they all actually had a lot to say in their discussions.  It goes to show the fact that when you&#8217;re introduced to these issues surrounding diversity, it takes some time to process &#8211; and that&#8217;s okay!  As an ensemble I think we learned to not take the audience&#8217;s reaction so personally.</p>
<p>I think this past performance really set us up for how this weekend will be and allowed us to learn and understand that this performance isn&#8217;t about freshmen &#8220;getting it&#8221;.  It&#8217;s meant to work as a starting point for people to be introduced to and invited into the conversation.  And I think we&#8217;ve accomplished just that.</p>

			<p>Sorry for the silence! We&#8217;ve been hard at work trying to make the best work of art possible for you guys (and girls (and gender-non-conforming individuals)). In fact, tonight is our final rehearsal before we start performing in front of audiences! We&#8217;ve gotten basically everything down; it&#8217;s just a matter of polishing and fine tuning some things.</p>
<p>However! Though this show is created primarily for you first-years, that doesn&#8217;t mean that other people can&#8217;t see it. We will be having a community showing a week from today, Sunday the 25th, at 10 PM. I highly encourage every Muhlenberg community member to try and come see it. It&#8217;s really important.</p>
<p>Well, back to work for me. See y&#8217;all soon!</p>

			<p>These last 24 hours are, I think, the most intense 24 hours of the project.<br />
Yesterday morning the ensemble slept in, and then, even once we got up, we really didn’t speak to each other. A sense of angst permeated the entire space.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think we were all dreading rehearsal too much.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last night was script building night. For more information on our process, you can check out <a href="http://sedehidiversityproject.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/2013/08/06/how-we-do-it/">Ben’s awesome post</a>. But let it be said that last night was final trimmings and ordering the lines, as well as preffing which lines we want. We finished Thursday night’s rehearsal with 35 pages of script and we absolutely LOVED every word in it. Unfortunately, the script had to be capped at 18 pages. And we needed to finish the evening’s rehearsal with a finished product</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We were all less concerned than we could’ve been – last year’s ensemble began their final script building night with 100 pages of material, and they were there for 12 hours. Starting at 35 we all kind of figured we’d be out by 1am, or maybe 2am at the latest. That’s late, and 7 or 8 hours of rehearsal late respectively, but still offers a decent night’s sleep. Early in the week we’d worked till 3 anyways, so we figured we were set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So why the pervasive angst?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All nine of us have very different identities. We all believe in the incredible importance of these conversations, but because our lived experiences are different, there was a high chance that the particular topics we’d want addressed would differ. For instance, a lesbian member of the ensemble would want to make sure certain lesbian issues on campus are addressed (for instance the objectification of girl-girl couples or the fact that there are so few out lesbians on campus) while a male gay member of the ensemble would want to make sure certain gay male issues on campus are addressed (for instance the commoditization of the flamboyant gay man in terms of GBF or how performances of masculinity intersect with sexual identity.) These kinds of conflicts exist in multitude for each of our 9 areas we intended to address.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The angst in our apartment, I think, was tension building up among all of us, ready to fight for the importance of our individual identities. We all love each other incredible amounts and would never want to hurt each other, so the looming decisions between what stories we need told and what stories those we love need told was scary. And stressing everybody out a bit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We tried to make rehearsal as painless as possible from the beginning. We all ordered take out and it sort of had that party atmosphere. We knew it would be painful, but we were still intending a 1 or 2 am bed time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We started sorting lines and were doing great! We had a whole 2 pages of the script before we came to a halt. We just couldn’t find anything to fit and were really struggling to continue. At that point Mel, with all her directorial powers, told us that we needed to start cutting lines. We got 20 lines on each subject – it was time to make some choices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cutting out entire dialogues was really hard. There were so many topics that were so important to so many of us. We poured over all the tiny slips of paper for hours. And hours. And hours. But everyone was more civil than I ever could have imagined possible. If our stories had to be cut, it was always in service of the project, because we understood that other stories<i> needed</i> to be told and it was only that our stories should be told. And nothing stops us from telling our stories here or to others elsewhere.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Flow was maybe more important to all of us than it should’ve been. Deciding which lines fit with each other and which experiences were similar in tone despite differences in topic was difficult and grueling but thought provoking in a lot of ways, too. It passed 1am and we definitely weren’t done. It passed 2am and there was no end in sight.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Around 3:45am we had a finished script. In the form of hundreds of tiny slips of paper laid out across a long table. Precisely in order based on our previous 9.75 hours of discussion. Mel typed each slip of paper into an open document on her computer while we watch music videos of ridiculous songs (some of which may be featured in our pre-show! So get excited for that.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By 4:30am the script was finish, typed, printed, and in our hands. It was 18 pages long, but we couldn’t go to bed without a read-through – we had to make sure the script came in under time as well as under length.</p>
<p>At 5am we finished the read through – the script was the perfect length. But also so totally wrong. Things were lost that were absolutely necessary to the conversation. Things were present that were maybe not so important. It felt absolutely horrible for our finished product to feel so wrong after 11 hours of work. So, in we dove again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ripping apart a script that’s taken months of research and transcribing and discussion and decision honestly feels like killing your child. From 6am-7am ensemble members were maybe the most hopeless we’d been. We needed to go through each and every line again, decide how necessary it is, whether or not it flows from the previous line and into the following line, and how we can trim it for length. It just suddenly seemed like such an endless task.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But then, all of a sudden, around 7:15, everything fit again. We’d cut enough and added enough that maybe we could try another read through.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This one was largely successful. Maybe that’s because we were so tired that any script would feel like success, but I do truly think this is an amazing project. Considering the time limitations, I think this says everything we want to say, and is still engaging and beautiful and funny and entertaining and everything the Sedehi Diversity Project should be.  Everyone else agreed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At 8am we were finally finally finally done building our script. We were all so giddy and happy that no one was holding it together. Well, with the exception of Ben Sam and Will R who still sort of were. Someone has our celebratory video (composed of lots of screams of success) so get excited for that!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we left our windowless prison and saw the sun I’m pretty sure Mel melted. She’s probably actually a vampire. Or just hadn’t really realized how late in the day 8am is to still be awake. But probably the former.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After we got back to our apartment I was so wide awake. We’d created something wonderful and put an entire new set of energy into the world! And remained as close, if not closer because of it! How was I supposed to sleep! So I’ve tried to be productive this morning – going on a run, doing my laundry, writing blog posts. But the crash has got to come soon! After being awake for 24 hours, and 14 straight hours of rehearsal, I don’t know how much longer I can function. My condolences go out to Mel, Will R, and Vernon who can’t go to sleep for quite some time. Mel and Will are busy divvying up the script to the performers and giving everybody lines, and Vernon has tour guide duties. I’m sure those prospectives are going to be absolutely overwhelmed with his enthusiasm!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And on that note, I am off to bed. The past 24 hours have cemented our bond as an ensemble, I think. In addition to creating something I think is really wonderful and I hope we can all feel really proud of. So, at 10:30am, I say to you, good night!</p>

			<p>Hallelujah! The script is finished!</p>
<p>Rehearsal started at 6pm Friday August 9th and we did not rest until it was finished&#8230;..at 8am Saturday August 10th.  Is this considered dedication or insanity?</p>
<p>Although it was a somewhat grueling process, we were fortunate to not come across any truly difficult arguments amongst us.  That being said I think I can speak for the entire cast when I say that cutting some of the various sections and conversations was somewhat heart-breaking and disappointing.  Overall, however, I think we were successful and I&#8217;m looking forward to getting started memorizing our lines and really getting into rehearsing and preparing for the performances!</p>

			<p>For the past 7 years, as part of my work advising the <strong>Sedehi Diversity Project</strong>, I’ve been privileged to partake in some amazing conversations with Muhlenberg community members about what diversity means. Those conversations have taught me a lot, especially about the inaccurate assumptions people make about one another.</p>
<p>One of the biggest inaccurate assumptions I’ve encountered is that we all mean the same thing when we use the word “diversity.” Hoo boy, is this ever not the case! I’ve learned that there are a lot of different definitions of diversity floating around out there. A. Lot.</p>
<p>One of the most common ones is that diversity refers to the multiple ways people can be different from one another. And I guess that’s not really inaccurate, at least not when you think about the word divorced from history.</p>
<p>The problem is though, when you do that – when you think about diversity as disconnected from a history in which some people have been systematically oppressed – you end up in conversations about “diversity of shoe-size” and “diversity of interests.” And is that really what we want to be talking about? Sound boring and pointless? You&#8217;re feelin&#8217; me here, aren&#8217;t you?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m thinking about this because today someone asked me what my definition of diversity was. And because it surprised them – and because it surprised <em>me</em> that it surprised them – I figured I’d get all bloggy and share it here.</p>
<p>To me, diversity refers to <strong>the work that communities do</strong> to expose and dismantle the systems of oppression that inhibit the thriving presence and influence of people who have been historically underrepresented, or people who have marginalized identities. In that way, I guess diversity is more ‘verbish’ than ‘nounish’ to me. It&#8217;s work. It&#8217;s work that we all have the responsibility to do.</p>
<p>That’s my definition. What’s yours?</p>

			<p>In our determination to finish going through all of the transcriptions, the majority of the cast stayed up until 3AM!  I applaud us for sticking through and working hard.  I will say that some of us reached that point of being slap happy.  And in the middle of rehearsal we it was decided that some of us needed a dance break&#8230;.</p>

<p>Now Vernon, Ben, and myself stayed up &#8217;til 8am that previous night/morning? and only received about 4-6 hours asleep.  I was particularly impressed with myself.  I didn&#8217;t wake up until 12:50! That&#8217;s so late for me and I felt so unproductive!  Unfortunately it looks like another late night&#8230;</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>When I first came to Muhlenberg as a freshman I was hesitant about the college for a lot of reasons. Luckily, orientation demonstrated that I had come to a really great place. Especially seeing the Sedehi Diversity Project for the first time.</p>
<p>Myself, along with one hundred or so freshmen filed into the performance space in our orientation groups, and I was completely unsure of what to expect. Orientation puts you through the wringer &#8211; you&#8217;re busy constantly and completely over stimulated by all the new people you&#8217;re meeting and new experiences you&#8217;re having. That coupled by the hurricane and everyone was a little frazzled. Once we were all seated, the director of the project stood up and introduced the play &#8211; I don&#8217;t even remember what she said &#8211; and then it began.</p>
<p>Students just started talking. And saying things I&#8217;d never heard anyone say before.</p>
<p>The diversity project talks about a lot of topics. Generally, we cover discussions of race, class, gender, sexual orientation, religion, ability (in terms of physical disabilities, learning disabilities, and mental health), body image, and Muhlenberg’s relationship to Allentown.</p>
<p>I honestly did not know people were allowed to talk about these issues. I’d been taught all my life that it was rude to talk about race or class or religion or ability, and why bother talking about sexual orientation or gender – non-normativity in these areas doesn’t exist. And suddenly my peers were all around me being blatantly honest about how they felt.</p>
<p>I realized I fit somewhere. That things I’d been experiencing in my life were real. And that conversations about diversity aren’t rude, they are 100% necessary. All of the time. For every.</p>
<p>I cried during my first viewing of the Sedehi Diversity Project. Four separate times. I’d never thought about ways in which core aspects of my identity had an impact on positive and negative experiences of life. I’d always thought it was just my life and those experiences happened detached from any sense of identity. Just to me. But as it turns out, those positive and negative life experiences are attached to aspects of identity that inform how you interact with everything and everyone!</p>
<p>After the Diversity Project, orientation groups have lengthy discussions about what they’ve seen and their feelings regarding diversity. My orientation group, together, grappled with the loss of the naïve perspective our high schools had taught us. We were shocked by the play and shocked by each other. That day 4 of us came out to each other (be it in official discussion or in conversation amongst ourselves). I’d never come out to any one before and here I was coming out to whole groups of people! Because SDP told me I could!</p>
<p>I think the Sedehi Diversity Project, more than anything else, connects people. It facilitates conversations with people who are different. It facilitates conversation with people who are the same (but didn’t know they were the same at all).  And it starts the most important conversation – a conversation about power and access and how we all interact with each other and the world</p>

			<p>Monday, July 6th</p>
<p>While rehearsing tonight, we were startled by this loud BOOM and upon further inspection we realized there were fireworks outside!</p>
<p>We took a break from the script and viewed the amazing fireworks that were held in Trexler Park, which is across the way from the Village.</p>
<p><a href="http://sedehidiversityproject.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/08/20130805_213009.jpg"><img alt="SDP 2013 fireworks" src="http://sedehidiversityproject.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/08/20130805_213009-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a><a href="http://sedehidiversityproject.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/08/20130805_213038.jpg"><img alt="more fireworks" src="http://sedehidiversityproject.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/08/20130805_213038-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>

<p>and here is a link to the Sedehi Diversity Project&#8217;s youtube page which features two videos of the fireworks! (it also features the cast in our natural crazy selves)</p>
