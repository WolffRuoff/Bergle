					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I choose to write my essay for this class about Cyberbullying. When I was doing research I did the same exact thing that you did. I definitely remember all the assemblies I had about it before college. Cyberbullying has always been a topic that interested me because of the unsettling point that you said you find that most of the time in cyberbullying people do not know who the bully actually is. Which I think is a little unfair and the government should do more to help stop this. However, with the ever growing advancements in technology people have ability to hide behind the screen and never be caught. You are completely right it is very unsettling.&lt;/p&gt;
