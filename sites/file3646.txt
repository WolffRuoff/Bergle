					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Great article that is highly relevant here, Group 5.  The burst of interest in new advertising models for social media and other forms of online media is something that is seems to be driving this industry.  It&#039;s interesting, too, that much of the buzz centers not around traditional websites, per se, but instead on discrete online environments (smartphone apps, Facebook apps, Twitter apps and uses, etc) that have become the springboards for targeting consumers with sales pitches.  The fact that Apple and Google have so much data about each and every user, for instance, also makes this a ripe opportunity for very specific, target marketing.  Thanks for the interesting article!&lt;/p&gt;
