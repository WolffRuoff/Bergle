								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span lang="EN-US">In today’s internet community, not only famous people, but also normal people can be seen by the public through search engines or some social media. And the thing we should do first in this open community is to try to know what other people see through my social media accounts. So I use an afternoon to pretend I am a stranger and searching information through Google to try to know a person named JiahuiHuang. First of all, I entered the name JiahuiHuang in the Google engine to see if something shows. But the result really disappointed me, no matter if I click on ALL, Images, or Videos, the only place I can find myself is the LinkedIn—I am the eighteenth in line. To have a more accurate result, I also tried to search my information from other search engines like Bing and DuckDuckGo, though the messages they showed are different, I can’t find more information about myself. I started to think if my mother tongue is not English, and I stayed in a country that speak Chinese in my past eighteen years that would influence the result. So I searched my information in Google again, but this time in Chinese. Again, I found nothing, because so many people in China are named JiahuiHuang and I am not famous. Then I added some key words during the searching like my primary school. Excellent, I finally found a few things about myself during this searching—some writings that were awarded and some other award certificates at my primary school, and no more can be found.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Why do I have so little information in the internet? Few reasons</span><span lang="EN-US">: </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">1. I am not famous</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">2. I am not a person who is outstanding—famous in a particular field, won some special award or had some special achievements.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">3. I am kind of a person that out of the online social community, I post nothing and sometimes I use a pseudonym in some social media such as Facebook and Instagram.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Is it a great thing that others will have a hard time to find my real information through the network? From a security and privacy perspective, yes! But in my heart, I will feel uncomfortable that others can’t find something about me, because this proves I am not an outstanding person. In the future, though I will still not post something about myself, I hope others can find more about me through searching in Google. And what I hope to be seen in the future network in five years is something like this: JiahuiHuang, an outstanding student who used to study in Muhlenberg; Stanford student, JiahuiHuang, assists the professor in the important study of a subject; JiahuiHuang, reports an essay in a scientific magazine… </span></p>
