								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apart from not fully being able to understand the question, I recall Randall saying that </span><span style="font-weight: 400">as long as I was stimulated by the prompt, I could write about what in it inspired me. Performance to me can be anything. When I perform I get to express myself and let people into my brain whether they know me or not. I feel that I could embody how I feel or how I’m doing in movement better than words can ever describe. In the Cuddy article, it discusses the importance of presence. Presence could be how someone takes up space or the energy that comes off of someone when they enter the room. According to the article “</span><i style="font-size: 1rem"><span>Presence, as I mean it throughout these pages, is the state of being a tune to an able to comfortably express our true thoughts, feelings, values, and potential.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> That’s it is not a permanent, transcendent mode of being. It comes and goes. It is a moment to moment phenomenon” (Cuddy). Whenever I hear </span><span style="font-weight: 400">the word ‘presence’, I associate it with someone that has confidence or a strong way or energy about them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The first unit of the semester was about History and Heritage. I honestly had no idea what the difference was to begin with. History in my dancing is based upon my background with my family and also with my dance background. That is MY own history and no one else’s, I use that as inspiration when I perform. We even created a movement solo with inspiration from our histories and heritage to perform in Dance Gallery. Mine was based on my family and how there are ups and downs with having a huge family but somehow we all make things work. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The second unit was about culture. Even in classes like Dance and Society, we did an entire project on Folk Dances across the world. We had to learn a folk dance, perform it, teach it to the class, and give a presentation on it. We got to dive into other cultures just by learning folk dances across the globe. I feel like when people perform their own culture’s dance, a large sense of pride comes with the performance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The third unit was the body unit. Personally, I’ve had trouble accepting my body and loving my body for what it is. The hardest pill to swallow was that there was no such thing as a “dancer’s body” because everybody is a dancer’s body. This unit was honestly difficult for me. My body is extremely private to me and is not really something I talk about with others. It goes farther than appearances as well. As outgoing and talkative I may be, I’m a very private person. I openly share what I like with a select few people but not many people know me in that regard. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The fourth unit was gender, and this unit was my favorite. There is one hundred percent a disparity in the dance world between men, women, and those that are non-binary. I mentioned this in my other paper but Ballet has always been binary based and heteronormative. An example of this is all of the romantic storylines where the women rely on the men. A pet peeve I’ve always had, for my entire life, is that I don’t like being underestimated. Sometimes I feel that it is because I am a woman. While I perform, I try to feel like the strongest person out there, regardless of what I identify as. </span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We have both been learning much about how our personal views of our bodies fit into the wider scope of what it means to be dancers in a world constituted by an infinite range of dynamics of physicality. It was very interesting to study bodies, something that is usually very personal, together as a class, because dance is an art form that relies on the body being displayed, and we found that it is important to value the tensions that this form of physical expression can have, in order to find a community that honors all bodies and how their owners perceive them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Both of us came away from our meetings with Gayanne with new knowledge of our physical selves, but also new tensions and pressures, because what we learned was not always what we had been told before in our dancing lives. As Greyson acknowledges, these screenings were both positive and negative. We experienced surface-level learning, such as the basics of why our bodies move the way they do, such as Ashling being told specifically that her hamstrings are tight, and how to stretch them. Greyson was told that her knees slightly point inward when her feet are parallel so all her life she has never had a true parallel. We were also given information that affected our psyche as dancers who have long held certain ideals. Greyson told Gayanne that she wanted to become more flexible, especially with a middle split, but Gayanne said this quality of flexibility was unnecessary. Ashling experienced a very similar situation regarding the same area of her body&#8211; she was told that splits were not the only indication of flexibility. This was difficult for both of us to hear, because Greyson had grown up being told to stretch every day, and Ashling has always thought her limited flexibility was one of her greatest flaws as a dancer. We both learned that what we prioritized in our dancing bodies&#8211; sheer flexibility&#8211; was actually not as worthwhile to build as things such as posture and strength, to maximize what we personally have. Greyson found all of this information to be overwhelming, because there was much to correct, especially in ballet, which is already such a structured dance form, where bodies and all their nuances are made very apparent. Ashling felt similarly, but she also welcomed the opportunity to integrate what she learned into her dancing, because she realized that she cannot simply copy the movements of others anymore, without considering how the choreography works best in her own body, so she is working on fully using and appreciating what she has, instead of wishing it were different. We believe that both the struggles and the opportunities that came from these screenings are worth continually working through in class, in order to gain optimum awareness and agency in our unique bodies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Due to all of these corrections we found ourselves making, classes and master classes were sometimes challenging, but often times rewarding as we entered into this unit. Greyson did not focus as much on all the corrections from Gayanne, but rather, tried to experience class for what is was and to learn new things. Currently, she finds some floor work to be intimidating because of the pain in her knee, and simply because floor work can be confusing. In the Madboots master class, when the floor work portion came around, she paid extra attention to the directions of where to move and completed it. Ashling was also able to just let go and connect with her body during this master class. She found it a valuable way to physically explore herself. To start the class, we all laid on the ground and focused on our breathing. This gave Ashling the opportunity and ability to put her mind elsewhere and to just connect with how her body was present in the moment to inform her dancing. Both Greyson and Ashling left with positive experiences from the master classes, as well as from our regular class discussions. We both found that our drawings of ourselves on the yellow papers really gave us new perspectives on our bodies, because we were able to take abstract concepts and translate them into our grounded, physical selves. Greyson drew triangles as a symbol of strength, to remind her of this quality in her overall character as well as her dancing. And Ashling wrote about her family, heritage, and passions where her bones would be, to also explore where her strength comes from, and as a reminder to think of her origins as she moves creatively. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the video, “Barack Obama &amp; Misty Copland On Race, Body Image &amp; Staying Humble,” Obama discusses how in prominent positions in the world today there are many more role models for black, asian, and hispanic bodies than there used to be. However, though this change has been happening, there is still not enough representation compared to white bodies (TIME). This video put things in perspective for us as white women. We have been fortunate enough to have people of our own race and gender to look up to, but not everyone has this experience. Ashling wonders how much inspiration, especially in the dance community, she has had that has to do with the fact that her race makes a place in society for her almost automatically. She also wonders how her dance path would have been different if she had not felt so included and represented. Greyson thinks about the same thing, but takes this context of representation into the broader opportunities she gets in the workforce and at Muhlenberg, which shows that these issues about dancing bodies are not confined to the dance world itself.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">A Rap On Race</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> put our minds and bodies into conversation in specific ways relating to representation and voices. It made Ashling see clearly how important dance is for conveying meaning and shedding light on so much of today’s society. Greyson believes that dance is an effective way to address issues in a way that many can understand and feel. There is no need for big, confusing words to explain issues, when dance invites people to understand through feeling. Ashling found that she has a specific kind of voice when she uses her body as a dancer, that can comment on physical, intellectual, and emotional aspects of people and the world. She realizes that she can honor her body as a tool for storytelling and social change. Both of us identify with the fact that portraying a deep message with the body is immensely more important than how high a battament can be. Though she found </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">A Rap on Race</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> confusing at times, Greyson realized that the dancers were representing the tone of the conversation that was happening onstage. Even though the performance was complicated for us, not everything needed to make sense for us to see the ultimate message of tension between bodies, both the ideologies of living as a certain race that the speakers conveyed, as well as how the dancing bodies moved in response to that tension. It gave us a stronger perspective of why we dance, and how our own dancing can also have meaning by reflecting things in the greater world that are important to us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">An influential dancer who worked with the body in groundbreaking ways was Bob Fosse. His career was during the late 20th century, but his work is still alive and relevant today. His movement style has been described as “provocative, entertaining, and quite unlike anything ever before seen,” and in his work as both a dancer and a choreographer, he challenged the notions of what the body can mean as an instrument of entertainment, power, and change (“Bob Fosse”). This can especially be seen in his choreography for “Big Spender” from the musical “Sweet Charity.” This is an all-female piece characterized by sharp, angular movements. The women do not shy away as passive, soft figures, but instead, stick out parts of their bodies in poses and isolations, moves of confidence which show they have agency over their bodies and how they move. Even their hands are artistically accentuated, which brings such a commonplace body part, which so many non-dancers use every day, into the field of art, to bridge the gap between the ordinary and the artist (“Sweet Charity”). This idea of the body being at once pedestrian and prodigious was one of Fosse’s biggest artistic characteristics. By working on films, he intentionally brought dance into the modern era, and opened the door to who had the opportunity to see dance outside of live performance (“Bob Fosse). Fosse saw value in the dancing body, not only as a visual form of entertainment, but also as a means to elicit change. Just as Ashling pondered when she saw </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">A Rap On Race</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, people in prominent positions of power in the arts have a responsibility to use their voices to speak important messages, instead of making merely trivial pieces that are fun in the moment but do not spark larger conversation. Fosse did just that with his work, preferring to comment on the more serious and introspective qualities of humanity, rather than comedy (Britannica). His choreography used bodies strikingly and confidently, to show how dancers are at once artists and people, connectors between the souls and bodies of humanity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In last unit’s journal, Marcie commented on Greyson’s paper that she needed to open up and share her experiences as a moving, thinking, feeling dancer and human being. She also noted to connect topics in this course to her life as a whole. This is hard for Greyson to do because she does not consider herself a strong writer, but she is starting to see how topics in this class connect with her own life. Ashling, on the other hand, has an inverted question to think about. Randall asked her how the personal cultural practices which we explore in class can be related to the wider scope of our existence as humans. As an introspective person, it is often difficult for Ashling to contextualize her experiences within a larger frame, but she realizes that this is an important practice, especially for finding and creating meaning in art beyond the surface, and she will continue to consider the wider world as she studies dance.</span></p>
