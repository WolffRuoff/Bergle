<p><span style="color: #0000ff"><em><strong>Our reaction and writeup of St. Stephen&#8217;s Green:</strong></em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;color: #000000">We went to St. Stephen’s Green on March 3, 2018, at 15:30. For some historical context, William Sheppard designed St. Stephen’s Green and it is approximately 247,500 square meters. It is located across the street from Grafton Street, which has become a major tourist attraction for its various food and shopping opportunities. Informally, many people call it just Stephen’s Green (“St. Stephen’s Green,” 2018). We went the day after the huge snowstorm lifted from Dublin, Ireland and were shocked to see so many people in the park. From walking dogs to sightseeing, people were everywhere. The weather on this day was rainy and cold, but it was a place for people to get out of their homes after being shut in for five days. What was interesting about witnessing this place was how people interacted with it. When we interviewed a woman and her daughter she talked about the fact that they were in St. Stephen’s Green to get out of the place they were staying in because of the storm. They weren’t from Ireland but were here on vacation from France. She and her daughter were enjoying the fact that the park had reopened and that they were able to walk around. She also talked about how she felt in the park. She said it was nice to be in the park surrounded by nature and in a place that was beautiful. With this in mind, as we continued walking through the park, we noticed many people on their mobile phones. This is also shown in the video we have created. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-weight: 400">Listening to the women’s interview and contrasting it to the clips we recorded was interesting. St. Stephen’s Green is a tranquil and beautiful place to be even on a rainy day. With this being said, almost everyone we had walked by or filmed was on their mobile phone taking pictures. This addresses Rowen Wiken and Gerard Goggin’s discussion of place and the phenomenological approach to understanding place in their chapter “Mobilizing Place Conceptual Currents and Controversies” in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Foundations of Mobile Media Studies</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">. Although people were in the park, most were focused on their phones rather than the park itself. They were seeing the park through their phone. Wiken and Goggin talk about this idea when they write about “phone space” and “local space” (2017, p. 60). Most of the people we encountered, and ourselves included, were spending more time on the “phone space” than the “local space” of the park. Although pictures are an effective way to document a place, pictures are not the same as being part of a place. The way that the woman we interviewed felt while being in St. Stephen’s Green cannot be captured completely through a photo.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-weight: 400">Separating oneself from their “phone space” enables one to really become part of a place. We were also giving our attention to our “phone space” in order to capture the video clips we wanted to create our final video and not fully taking in what St. Stephen’s Green had to offer as a beautiful park. Wilken and Goggin also address this idea when they write about “fluctuating levels of attentiveness” in regards to the phenomenological approach (2017, p. 60). Not only were people spending time on their phones taking pictures of the place, but many of them were also taking “selfies.” Their attention was given to their phone and making sure their pictures looked good. Selfies, once posted to a social media outlet, allow for social media peers and/or followers to see a person’s whereabouts or places that they have gone.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400">This can then lead to one feeling gratified by this simple selfie as the picture then starts to receive likes and comments. Although there were many people on their phones, there were also a few people that were in the park walking around without their phone in their hands. For the people that live in Ireland and near St. Stephen’s Green, the park might just serve as a place to walk around “offline.” To those who do not live near the park or in Ireland at all, the park is a tourist attraction and capturing this place is important. Understanding that St. Stephen’s Green has various meanings to those who visit it is important to think about when understanding place. These various meanings, whether that is a place to escape the workplace, take a walk, walk one’s dog, or talk to friends, change the meaning of St. Stephen’s Green as a place.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="color: #0000ff"><em><strong>Interviews: Jason and Noa </strong></em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333"><em>Jason&#8217;s Interview:</em></span></p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-79 aligncenter" src="http://mobilemedia.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2018/03/IMG_8676-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="238" height="317" srcset="http://mobilemedia.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2018/03/IMG_8676-225x300.jpg 225w, http://mobilemedia.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2018/03/IMG_8676-768x1024.jpg 768w, http://mobilemedia.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2018/03/IMG_8676-1x1.jpg 1w" sizes="(max-width: 238px) 100vw, 238px" /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Mobile phones have become heavily integrated into people’s every day lives with the construction and rise of the smartphone. Using the domestication theory in relation to my interview with Jason was interesting. Leslie Haddon writes in her excerpt, <em>Domestication and social constraints on ICT use: Children’s engagement with smartphones</em>, “Domestication analysis helps to make sense of people’s engagement with technologies through understanding the broader context of their lives” (2018, p. 71). With this idea in mind, I was able to apply the theory when listening and recording Jason’s answers to the various questions I had asked him. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Starting off with some questions about Jason’s everyday use of his phone helped me gain a better understanding of how important his phone is to him. Jason told me that he typically uses his phone throughout the entire day checking it almost every 45 seconds to a minute. This information revealed that Jason’s phone is constantly attached to him allowing him to check often during the day. The availability of his mobile phone provides him with a way to connect and communicate with family and friends back home, which he discussed later in our interview. This concept of access and use of the mobile phone is also talked about in Haddon’s piece. She writes about how not only is it important to understand how the mobile phone is integrated into people’s lives but to also understand why the mobile phone has been integrated (Haddon, 2018, p. 71). When I started asking Jason why he thought he uses his phone so much throughout the day his answers were also interesting.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">He talked about the fact that his phone is the first thing he checks in the morning and the last thing he looks at before he goes to bed. He also mentioned that his phone serves as an alarm clock to wake up in the morning. This action addresses how the phone doesn’t just serve as a communication device, but also has many other functions that Jason is able to utilize. Jason spends a lot of time on YouTube watching highlights from the NBA, NFL, and NHL. He talked about the fact that he uses YouTube to stay up to date with these sports channels, but also as a way to pass time. He said when he wants to “space out or if I’m bored” he will go on YouTube. This particular action gratifies his needs through the technology of his smartphone.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">A few other apps that Jason talked about a lot when it came to what he uses his phone for were FaceTime, Snapchat, Instagram, Messages and the Bleacher Report. FaceTime and Messages are apps that allow Jason to communicate with his parents and friends back in the States and also some friends who are abroad. This abundance of various apps addresses Troels Fiboek Bertel’s concept in his piece, <em>Domesticating smartphones,</em> of how smartphones are malleable devices (2017, p. 89). Jason is able to configure and control the way he uses his phone through the apps he has decided to use. He is able to communicate, stay updated with what his friends and family are up to through social media, watch highlights from various sports games and even check the stats of his teams’ players.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">After understanding Jason’s ability to customize his phone based off his needs, we started to discuss how the smartphone has enabled us to stay connected with our loved ones back home and we then started to think about what it was like before the smartphone and before all of these useful apps. The smartphone has provided people with a portable, accessible, and easy way to talk and stay connected with one another. Although written mail and email is still an option, the immediate and constant ability to talk or stay connected with others is what the smartphone has provided. Jason and I talked about this idea as we were exploring what we use our phones for.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">As we continued to discuss the functionality of our phones and what Jason’s uses his for, he told me a memorable experience regarding his phone. He recalled leaving his phone at home by accident and going almost an entire day without it. He talked about the fact that he felt as if a part of him died. We laughed a bit because this seemed dramatic, but it is true. Haddon talks about the constraints that smartphones have on people (2018, p. 71) and after going back over the interview with Jason I was able to understand Haddon’s concept. Jason talked about how when he forgot his phone at home he felt as if a part of him had died. The smartphone has become part of his identity. It has been integrated into his life as a necessity. He talked about how he feels comforted if his phone is in his hand or pocket because he knows that he has it with him.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Without his phone, he has lost his constant information and connectivity and this makes him feel uneasy. Jason’s smartphone is part of his everyday routine. He did talk about how the most important use of his smartphone is to communicate with his friends and family, but that he is also thankful and appreciative of the other functions his phone provides. With this in mind, Haddon’s idea of incorporating the smartphone into one’s life can be explored (2018, p. 73). Jason has been able to “tame” the technology of his smartphone, which is an idea that is also discussed in Haddon’s piece, <em>Domestication Analysis, Object of Study, and the Centrality of Technologies in Everyday Life</em>. She talks about the fact that using the domestication theory shows how technology has been tamed by the individual based upon one’s adaptation to one’s environment and the changes among technology (2011, p. 317). Through this interview, I understood Jason’s relationship with his phone and how he uses it in a broad context of his life. He has evolved with the technology as technology has advanced, but he has also customized and been in control of when and how he uses his phone. The integration of his phone within his life is important to analyze and understand, for this has become the norm of our society.</span></p>

<p><em><span style="color: #000000">Noa&#8217;s Interview:</span></em><span style="color: #000000"><img class=" wp-image-80 aligncenter" src="http://mobilemedia.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2018/03/IMG_6503-229x300.jpg" alt="" width="221" height="290" srcset="http://mobilemedia.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2018/03/IMG_6503-229x300.jpg 229w, http://mobilemedia.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2018/03/IMG_6503-768x1008.jpg 768w, http://mobilemedia.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2018/03/IMG_6503-780x1024.jpg 780w, http://mobilemedia.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2018/03/IMG_6503-1x1.jpg 1w" sizes="(max-width: 221px) 100vw, 221px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">It is unquestionable how much mobile technologies have developed and impacted the entire world. With the integration of mobile technologies, came a rise of innovation and intellectual curiosity, unlike anything that was seen before. One of these mobile technologies that had changed the world forever with its integration was the mobile phone. After interviewing Noa Boonin, it became clear that the mobile phone has not just become useful for human life, but also something that is so heavily relied on, that doing simple tasks without the devices seems unfathomable.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">From the moment she wakes up in the morning to the minute she falls asleep at night, the mobile phone consumes Noa’s everyday life. Becoming almost as routine as eating, Noa checks her mobile phone the most during the morning, mid-afternoon, and nighttime for notifications on updates in the social stratosphere. Just by habit, “I pick up my phone at least once every minute,” Noa explained. There is a new sense of gratification that comes with picking up one’s phone and seeing a notification, making the user feel like he or she is not alone. Echoing the words of Sherry Turkle, Noa has grown up in a world of “people [who] want to be with each other, but also elsewhere, connected to all the different places they want to be.” (Turkle TED Talk, 2012) Noa is the quintessential example of showing that being connected, but still feeling alone is a real issue that all people in the world deal with. Noa constantly has a need to check her phone for notifications as well as for social networking apps throughout the day. At one point it seemed like a convenience to have the ability to stay connected to all of her friends and social media followers, but as she explained: “we see the world through our phones nowadays and I do that too.” Whether it is taking a “selfie” with the picturesque background or a snapchat for the person’s social media followers to see the landscape that she is in, Noa, like many other millennials see the world through her mobile phone.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Mobile phones have become a “Swiss army knife” (Ling and Donner, 2013, p.13) of sorts for everyone in this media-driven generation. The interesting thing is, mobile technologies are so essential for everyday life in today’s world, that people are forced to adapt. People love new technologies and immediately adopt it into their lives until it becomes black boxed into society. After asking Noa about a memorable story with her mobile phone, she explained a story that happened fairly recently. When traveling to Copenhagen, Denmark, Noa was met with uncertainty after figuring out that her mobile phone would not work in the country without the use of Wi-Fi. She was left without her mobile phone for only a weekend, but she explained that it was one of the hardest times she had to go through. After not having the ability to find the closest open restaurant at a moment’s notice or see what was going on back in Ireland or even at home in New Jersey, it became real that a part of her was lost for the time being. Noa was forced to communicate with the locals in Denmark which was a far different expectation than continuously checking her phone like she would normally. It took until this trip to realize how domesticated mobile phones are in our everyday lives. Only being without the small piece of technology for three days created panic for Noa as well as those she was in the country with. It was a brand new task that she was unprepared for and she realized that mobile phones really have become much more than just a useful tool in today’s world.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">The mobile phone is much more important in today’s world than could ever be conceived when they first came out in 1973 by Motorola. When asked about the importance of a mobile phone to her life, Noa explained that “mobile phones are the only way to connect with others.” In fact, she did not mention face to face contact or real-life connections as well. Although a small detail, the way she explained that mobile devices are the only way to connect with others speaks to the impact that mobile phones have had on society. We have integrated mobile phones into our lives to a point that connections past mobile technology aren’t thought of at first glance. This idea of our mobile devices being integrated into our daily lives is something that Leslie Haddon touches upon in her piece, <em>Domestication and social constraints on ICT use</em>. Haddon explains that it is “domestication analysis [that] helps to make sense of people’s engagement with technologies through understanding the broader context of their lives.” (2018, p. 71) Noa said that she can use apple computer for some of the applications that are the same (as on her iPhone), but the mobile device is now always there and convenient. To Noa, mobile phones allow those who are abroad with her to keep in contact and stay connected. Mobile phones have been integrated into our lives as an essential part of us. Noa explained that you can use mobile phones to “browse social media while on the bus or waiting for the food to come and it is overall a way to connect. You always want to continue the conversation whether it is talking to my parents back in the states or talking to my boyfriend.” Clearly, through the integration of the mobile phone into today’s society it is more than an essential tool, Noa shows it’s the <strong>only</strong> way to have a connectivity with friends and family. Mobile phones are not just a useful technological device, it is a part of who she is and a part of many in society. Through the domestication theory, one can see how Noa’s words about the mobile phone show how integrated the technology have become in today’s society. People everywhere are so reliant on this tiny device that fits in the pocket in the world that without it, just like Noa’s experiences in Copenhagen, people feel lost. It is as if a part of them is lost, unable to be reconnected to the social media world and immediate gratification.</span></p>
