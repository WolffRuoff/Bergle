								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the pioneer of the microcomputer revolution and co-founder of the multi-billion-dollar technology company known as Apple, Steve Jobs has completely transformed the technology world we know today, creating innovative, user-friendly, life-altering products used by billions of people all over the world.</p>
<p>In Chapter 31 of the book, <em>Steve Jobs</em>, author Walter Isaacson delves into the creation of the first legal and reliable media player/library that has the ability to play, download, and organize digital audio and video on personal devices. In the early 2000s, the music industry was plagued by an array of piracy services, including Napster, Grokster, Gnutella, and Kazaa that illegally provided songs for free online. Jobs once said, “From the earliest days at Apple, I realized that we thrived when we created intellectual property. If people copied or stole our software, we’d be out of business. If it weren’t protected, there’d be no incentive for us to make new software or product designs. If protection of intellectual property begins to disappear, creative companies will disappear or never get started. But there’s a simpler reason: It’s wrong to steal. It hurts other people. And it hurts your own character” (2011). In an effort to find a legal alternative that would benefit both the customer as well as the music companies, Steve Jobs met with AOL Time Warner and Sony. Working with these companies was a nightmare to say the least and every service they tried to set into motion failed due to complicated restrictions and clunky interfaces.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until Jobs managed to persuade the five top record companies in the nation to allow digital versions of their songs to be sold that the “iTunes Store” was created. Jobs proposed not only to sell entire albums, but also individual songs for 99 cents, giving record companies 70% profit for each song sold. Jobs insisted that going down this route would be more appealing than the monthly subscription model preferred by most music companies. Jobs was right. He was able to convince the head of the Universal Music Group, Doug Morris, that he had the talent to produce a software that would portray the artistic and technological vision that most music companies lacked. Although Morris worked with plenty of artists, ranging from U2 to Eminem to Mariah Carey, Jobs still had much more work to do. “Corralling the record labels to go along with the iTunes plan was not enough, however. Many of their artists had carve-outs in their contracts that allowed them personally to control the digital distribution of their music or prevent their songs from being unbundled from their albums and sold singly. So Jobs set about cajoling various top musicians, which he found fun but also a lot harder than he expected” (2011). After rigorous work and plenty of convincing, Jobs was able to unveil the iTunes Store on April 28<sup>th</sup>, 2003. He explained at San Francisco’s Moscone Center, “The iTunes Store would start with 200,000 tracks, and it would grow each day. By using the store, you can own your songs, burn them on CDs, be assured of the download quality, get a preview of a song before you download it, and use it with your iMovies and iDVDs to make the soundtrack of your life.” As we know today, iTunes launched with great success, starting by selling a million songs in just six days.</p>
<p>Overall, Steve Jobs understood that producing this kind of technology requires both intuition and creativity, all of which he had. In every Apple product on the market, it is apparent how much importance Job’s put into the company’s integrity, user-friendliness, and attention to detail. Without the iTunes library, we would probably still be illegally downloading our favorite songs from bootlegged companies. However, today we can enjoy the 11<sup>th</sup> version of this media management software, with features like new album art, on-demand music stations, AirPlay, and the ability to download countless amounts of music, movies, TV shows, podcasts, books, and apps, all thanks to Steve Jobs.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I first googled the IPad, Wiki didn’t even come up as the first website, apple and news articles about the IPad came up. After scrolling down a little and I clicked on the Wiki article I figured that the information about the IPad would be true because who would write false information. But at the same time I was surprised at how much information Wiki has about the IPad.</p>
<p>In high school and even middle school everyone was always told that Wiki was never a reliable source. At first I hated that because Wiki had all this information in one place and back before computers, people use to use Encyclopedias for everything that they needed to look up. It makes you wonder why the online one couldn’t be as reliable, but then who would have wanted to sit down and type up the entire encyclopedia. The information on the IPad though seems pretty much correct. At first when I read the first paragraph about when the IPad first came out, I thought it was wrong. It says April 3, 2010 which doesn’t seem that long ago at all. Even though it was five years ago I feel like I’ve been using tablets my whole life.</p>
<p>My high school required that I have an IPad, everything was on it from our text book, homework, notes, assignments and schedules. It was all done online so for someone who used an IPad all the time it is hard to think that at one point in time that I wasn’t relying on one everyday.</p>
<p>But Steve Jobs had an idea and he stuck with it. According to Wiki, he said in 1983 “strategy is really simple. What we want to do is we want to put an incredibly great computer in a book that you can carry around with you and learn how to use in 20 minutes &#8230; and we really want to do it with a radio link in it so you don’t have to hook up to anything and you’re in communication with all of these larger databases and other computers.” (Steve Jobs, second paragraph) This was before the IPad even came out and became a thing, but one interesting thing that I learned was on the side of Wiki there’s a picture and it says “Apple’s first tablet from 1993” I was too young to remember this coming out but it looks really interesting and cool. It came with a pen and it was more of a smaller tablet that fit in your hand. Apple made other devices like it but decided not to sell it because they didn’t want to hurt message pad sales.</p>
<p>It was really interesting to go on Wiki though and read through an article like this, considering I never use Wiki. It is nice to have a place that all the information about one thing is in one place. But Wiki no longer really comes up as a first website like it use to. The internet has just noticed that I’ve never gone to it or it puts the more popular websites up first. Hopefully one-day Wiki will turn in to a reliable source or there will be another website that will replace Wiki and be so much better.</p>
