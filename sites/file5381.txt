								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Intersectionality&#8230;.is exactly how it sounds. It&#8217;s the idea that all aspects of our identity intersect, and affect how we experience the world. For example, one aspect of my identity is that I am a woman, while another aspect of my identity is that I&#8217;m straight. As a woman, I lack the privilege that comes with being a man in this society, but as straight, I have the privilege of having a sexual orientation that is typically accepted in this society. As a straight woman, I experience the world differently than a bisexual woman, or a straight man, even though we share certain aspects of our identity. Similarly, a straight white woman experiences the world differently than a straight black woman&#8230;all of these aspects affect your experience. Something really interesting about my identity is that intersectionality is significant even within my ethnicity- within one singular aspect of my identity. I&#8217;m multi-racial- half Egyptian and half Italian. Being Egyptian, a non-white identity, I have to deal with racial discrimination, but being Italian, a white identity, is more accepted and more of a privilege in this society. So even within my own ethnic identity, I experience the world really uniquely as an Egyptian-Italian, straight woman than even just an Egyptian straight woman or an Italian straight woman.</p>
<p>So. many. intersections.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s SO important to take all aspects of identity into consideration, because that intersectionality defines the privileges and/or struggles we face, it defines how we experience the world.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey all! I thought it was about time we starting defining things. You&#8217;ll hear some of these terms in the play, so consider these additional or alternate definitions:</p>
<p>Intersectionality is the idea that all of our identities inform our life experience, and that the way they interact is unique for every person. As an example, I&#8217;m a white Jewish male. So my experience would be different than a white Christian male&#8217;s even though we are both white men. The same goes for any aspect of identity: sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, you name it.</p>
<p>Another really important thing to take away is the fact that these multiple identities might mean that you have power in some facets of your life, but don&#8217;t in others. Continuing with me as an example, I have a lot of social power because I&#8217;m white, but the fact that I&#8217;m Jewish means that I&#8217;m also part of a historically oppressed minority group, and I lack power because of that.</p>
<p>However, do not take this to mean that a black male&#8217;s experience is equal to a white female&#8217;s experience. It isn&#8217;t as easy and mathematical as that (trust me, I&#8217;m a math major).</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll continue to talk about it throughout the year, so this is merely a heads-up. See y&#8217;all soon!</p>
