								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The rise of the Internet over the past twenty or so years has undoubtedly changed the way of life for many. From instant access to extensive amounts of information to being able to communicate with individuals on the other side of the world in a flash, the Internet has unquestionably made previously unimaginable tasks possible. This feat has, largely, been achieved through the development of social networking sites such as Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn. These sites certainly make connecting and communicating with people simple. Hence, Shannon Belew (2014, p. 1) explains in her book, <em>Art of Social Selling: Finding and Engaging Customers on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and Other Social Networks</em>, that there are over one billion people active on top social networks. “These networks include LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, and Google+” (Belew, 2014, p. 1). However, the positive effects of these social networking sites extend far beyond friendly communication. How else, then, are these social networks used?</p>
<p>One of the largest uses for social networking sites is commerce. It is no surprise that businesses are focusing their efforts toward social networks given the number of members these networks possess. Belew (2014, p. 1) notes that if businesses “are able to connect with even one-tenth of one percent of [these members], then [businesses] have reached more than one million people.” While being active on social networking sites does not guarantee businesses a million or hundreds of thousands of leads, it does provide them with the potential to reach “a high number of high-quality prospects” (Belew, 2014, p. 2). Commerce is home to a survival of the fittest mentality in which only the strongest businesses survive and outlive their competitors. Belew (2014, p. 2) states that effective businesses will be able to adapt to changes in the sales and marketing process that social media is responsible for. As a result, these businesses will be able to effectively monitor social media sites, see what potential customers want, and fulfill these demands. In doing so, the businesses that utilize social media will leave their competitors not using social media, and their sales quota, “in the dust” (Belew, 2014, p. 2).</p>
<p>Businesses are not the only winner when commerce takes place on social networking sites. Consumers can benefit as well. Belew (2014, p. 3) provides a prime example of a consumer that wins from commerce taking place over social networks in her story of a customer that had booked a reservation at a relatively well-known hotel in California. The hotel made an error in booking the woman’s reservation and it appeared as if she did not have a place to stay. The customer decided to take her frustrations to Twitter, where a competing hotel noticed her tweet. The hotel responded to the customer, suggesting that she stay at their hotel next time she was in the area. The hotel stated that they would be happy to take care of her and make her stay as relaxing and stress-free as possible. Of course, the hotel made sure that this tweet was public and in turn saw a “nice bump in reservations” (Belew, 2014, p. 3). Yet, the hotel was not the only winner in this scenario. The woman, or consumer in this case, and several other consumers, for that matter, benefited. The woman and other individuals knew that they could travel and have a hotel to stay in that would meet their expectations.</p>
<p>Moreover, a powerful bond exists between social media and commerce. Businesses know that by adapting to the new social media driven sales and marketing process they will be able to closely-observe social media sites, see what potential customers desire, and meet the demand for these wants so that a profit can be made. Consumers are still paying the same amount that they typically would for products, but they can rest assured that the money they are spending is going toward goods and services that will, more often than not, meet their expectations. Thus, the relationship between commerce and social media is not so bad after all. Rather, this connection is a positive one that yields the satisfaction of businesses and consumers alike.</p>
