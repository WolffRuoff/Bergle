					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I think it very interesting that you choose to put it in a heart. Definitely show any important message and the impact the class had on you. Looking at the words that you choose, I found it very interesting because there are words here that I would have never thought of and you opened my mind up to show much more and it very fascinating. This looks really good&lt;/p&gt;
