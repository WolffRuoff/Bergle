					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Dear &quot;Mules&quot;, or more elegantly stated ,Lacrosse Players and Students of Muhlenberg College, 
  I am so very proud of each and every one of you for having run the Tunnel to Towers Walk!  You all have honored Stephen Siller, the heroic fireman, as well as all who perished in this horrific happening which CANNOT and WILL NOT be forgotten.
    Thank you, also, Austin Akner, for your lovely written commentary on this event.  I am also very proud of the young man you have become.
                 Austin Akner&#039;s Grandmother,
                            Judy Gerard&lt;/p&gt;
