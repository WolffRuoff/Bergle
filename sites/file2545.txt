								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Trust, G. (5 April 2011). ‘Glee’ cast, Matthew Morrison score first radio hit, thanks to original songs. <em>Billboard</em>. Retrieved from <a href="http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/industry/tv-film/glee-cast-matthew-morrison-score-first-1005113042.story">http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/industry/tv-film/glee-cast-matthew-morrison-score-first-1005113042.story</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://blogs.villagevoice.com/dailymusto/Glee-Cast-glee-9252428-600-429.jpg" alt="" width="241" height="173" />What’s the difference between <em>American Idol</em> and <em>Glee</em>? After all, both are television shows that promote the music industry. One difference is that, until now, Fox&#8217;s <em>Glee</em> wasn’t in the business of producing new artists. While some of the <em>Glee</em> cast’s covers have taken the Internet by storm and run quickly up the Billboard Top 100—<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds38BOOtGIQ"><em>Don’t Stop Believin’</em> may be the most famous</a>—they’re still just different versions of already-famous songs. All of that changed, however, with the recent release of the first song produced specifically for the show, called “Loser Like Me,” which has a critical advantage over all the covers: It’s getting radio airplay, premiering at #37 on the Nielson Adult Top 40.</p>
<p><span id="more-1082"></span></p>
<p>This, of course, is huge. The radio and sound recording industries have been connected at the hip since their mutual beginnings during the turn of last century. Radio is a critical facilitator for the music industry, introducing targeted demographics of consumers to new music; radio, in turn, relies on other media to supply fresh material for its listeners. Producers, for their part, are all too willing to do that. The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/26/business/26music.html?_r=1">desperation with which producers jockey for radio airtime</a> speaks to radio’s enduring importance to the music industry in the age of 200-channel television and iTunes. Increasingly these producers include the owners and creators of television shows like <em>Glee</em> who are hoping to run their content through another window.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The producers of <em>Glee</em>, like the labels that sign the <em>American Idol</em> winners, can opt out of this desperation because their artists are practically guaranteed airplay. <em>Glee</em>’s enormous popularity on television means that the cast’s music, which premieres on the show, is practically “pre-sold.” Radio program directors take huge risks when they add new music to their playlists, and they’re always looking for ways to reduce that risk. What better way to do that than to play music that’s already popular on other media, like television?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indeed, the <em>Glee</em> cast’s transition from mere facilitators pimping other artists’ music every week to producers releasing new material has been nearly seamless, with program directors scrambling to play the new music. The music fits perfectly with what the modern pop radio industry wants: It’s upbeat, unchallenging, and <a href="http://www.billboard.com/news/glee-returns-with-huge-ratings-win-1004115894.story#/news/glee-returns-with-huge-ratings-win-1004115894.story">already popular with that crucial 18-34-year old audience</a> (<em>Glee</em> consistently ranks #1 among that audience, teenagers in general, and teenage girls in particular, the equivalent of a royal flush for Fox). Interviews with program directors across the country confirm that sentiment, with one program director in Indiana lauding the new song’s ability to “resonate with kids and parents” and admitting that the new song’s origins in <em>Glee</em> give it a “leg up” in gaining airplay on her station.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <em>Glee</em> cast will soon promote their new music by going out on tour, with 22 scheduled appearances set to begin on June 22nd in Minneapolis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The success of <em>Glee</em>’s new music speaks to the power of a popular program to travel across media. With a variety of television shows either playing others’ music or facilitating the production of new music, the synergy between the two industries has never been stronger. Media industries like radio, sound recording, and television help each other reduce risk by mutually sharing popular content, which translates into stronger revenues for the large conglomerates that own most media companies today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whether that translates into more choice for consumers, however, is questionable. Public advocates continue to argue that the sharing of content across media, especially unchallenging content like the <em>Glee</em> music that appeals to the lowest common denominator, drowns out artists and voices with alternative views that may challenge the media conglomerates. Until popular music stops making money, however, the conglomerates are likely to continue to encourage this type of cross-promotion of content into the future.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Graser, Marc. (2011, March 31). WB, Sony, U, and Fox cue premium VOD. <em>Variety</em>. Retrieved from <a href="http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118034714">http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118034714</a>.<a href="http://mediaindustries11.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/03/video-on-demand-image-photoshop.jpg"><br />
</a></p>
<p><a href="http://mediaindustries11.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/03/home_theter_04-535x354.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1018" src="http://mediaindustries11.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/03/home_theter_04-535x354-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a>In a controversial business venture that could significantly impact the film industry and its audiences, four major film studios have announced their involvement in the launch of Home Premiere, a premium video-on-demand service for feature films. Beginning next month, Warner Bros., Sony, Universal and 20th Century Fox will offer recently released theatrical films for a $30 fee over a two-to-three day viewing period, at the discretion of each particular studio. Several cable systems will offer the service, with DirecTV launching it initially to its 20 million customers. Warner Bros.&#8217; action thriller &#8220;Unknown&#8221; (2011) and Sony&#8217;s romantic comedy &#8220;Just Go With It&#8221; (2011) will be the first major releases offered via Home Premiere. While discussing the reasons this endeavor has come to fruition, studios have argued that offering these films for the $30 rate 60 days after theatrical release will <em>not</em> harm either box office returns or the financial stability of exhibitors, claiming that films make most of their money at the box office within the first three months. Further, these studios claim that the expense of a night out at the movies for families has harmed them financially between the cost of concessions, tickets, and possible babysitters, and this VOD service seeks to appease this by offering an opportunity to view relatively recent films at a cost that would be lower than an average trip to the theater.<span id="more-1016"></span></p>
<p>However, exhibitors and NATO (the National Association of Theater Owners) have expressed disappointment and anger over their fears of this premium VOD plan having a negative effect on theaters. In a statement, a NATO spokesman recently said, &#8220;They risk damaging theatrical revenues without actually delivering what  the home consumer seems to want, which is flexibility, portability and a  low price. These plans fundamentally alter the economic relationship  between exhibitors, filmmakers and producers, and the studios taking  part in this misguided venture.&#8221; In other words, a prominent concern of the exhibition viewpoint of the industry regards possible repercussions this new service could have on theatrical box office revenues.</p>
<p>Several theater chains, including Regal Entertainment, have threatened studios with the possibility of not releasing particular films if they are released on demand just six weeks after opening. Hypothetically, if Regal were to actually go through with this, it would have a devastating effect on nearly all theatrical grosses, as Regal is the largest theater chain in the U.S. When DirecTV initially proposed the VOD launch in February, they had mentioned the possibility of a short four-to-six week window between theatrical release and VOD release. This was when Regal threatened a boycott, and the four major studios had to intervene and talk DirecTV into lengthening the window to 60 days.</p>
<p>This is a striking example of power roles at work in the industry of motion pictures. In terms of the agreement to extend the window to 60 days from roughly 40, the exhibitors wielded their power over the distributors. Without the cooperation of Regal, the nation&#8217;s most prominent movie exhibitor chain, the studios would stand to lose millions of dollars in this risky endeavor. Although the exhibitors and NATO still seem unsure of Home Premiere&#8217;s possible financial implications, they are nonetheless on board with it, at least for now. It remains to be seen what the future holds for this new service, and whether it will be profitable overall or a financial bust. In the meantime, however, the fight between the different entities involved (specifically the exhibitors and distributors) has revealed a great deal of the number of compromises that go on behind the scenes in the motion picture industry.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Morabito, Andrea. (2011, Feb. 7). <em>Broadcasting &amp; Cable. </em>Retrieved from <a href="http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/463581-Super_Bowl_XLV_is_Most_Watched_TV_Program_Ever.php" target="_blank">http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/463581-Super_Bowl_XLV_is_Most_Watched_TV_Program_Ever.php</a>.</p>
<p>Super Bowl XLV last Sunday February 6, was the most watched television show in U.S. history. The game averaged 111 million total views. This beat last year’s Super Bowl’s record of 106.5 million spectators. The Super Bowl always rakes in extreme high numbers of viewers and for the past four years has set a viewership records.</p>
<p>            After the Super Bowl, an episode of <em>Glee</em> aired from 10:30 to 11:45 p.m. 26.8 million people watched increasing its total viewers 17% from its weekly average.<em> Glee’s</em> numbers were bigger than the episode of <em>The Office</em> that followed 2009’s Super Bowl. However, last year’s post Super Bowl’s episode of <em>Undercover Boss</em> drew bigger numbers than both <em>Glee </em>and The <em>Office.<span id="more-769"></span></em></p>
<p>            We suspect that the broad audience of a reality television show would lure in more viewers than a musically based high school sitcom. This makes us think about the idea of public interest and why Fox chose such a special interest show that does not seem to fit the same audience as the Super Bowl. An event like the Super Bowl can unite all different ages and demographics showing the positive possibilities for television. When Fox chooses to show a program like <em>Glee</em>, we feel the network has other motives in mind besides the public interest. Were they trying to attract a broader audience to increase network’s long term viewership? Was Fox trying to piggy back off of the popularity of the Super Bowl to increase <em>Glee’s</em> fan base? While <em>Glee</em> has proved its success, we feel that a show like <em>Undercover Boss</em> which has a wider appeal may have been a better fit for the Super Bowl’s audience’s actual desires and interests. This brings us back to the power relationship between the network heads and the audience. Networks don’t necessarily have to give audiences what may be best but instead they focus on what may be most lucrative, ultimately choosing their rising star, <em>Glee</em>. While traditional all-American football fans may not always mix with musical theater lovers, with Fox has anything to say about it, they will.</p>
