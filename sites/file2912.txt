<p>RBR-TVBR. (2011, April, 25). In-car streaming perceptions, misperceptions examined. <em>Radio Broadcasting Report.</em> Retrieved from http://www.rbr.com/radio/in-car-streaming-numbers-perceptions-misperceptions-examined.html</p>
<p>With the increasing technological growth and use of internet-streaming radio stations such as Pandora, iHeartRadio, and other cloud-based sites, the public still recognizes that the production and distribution of “over-the-air” terrestrial radio remains one of the most used media outlets while driving.  In a recent Radio Broadcasting Report article, it was made known through a survey of 18-44 year olds, that having streaming-internet radio in cars is not a threat at all to the AM/FM radio stations, or even Sirius/XM.  &#8220;The good news is most users of in-car streaming radio continue to use over-the-air radio extensively&#8221; (rbr.com).</p>
<p><span id="more-1171"></span></p>
<p>Using the Automobile Industry as one of their linking pins, internet streaming radio is trying hard to stream themselves over other industries.  Maybe for the satisfaction of becoming a vertically integrated industry, the internet might be a little over zealous when trying to take over multiple media outlets.  The majority of these blogs have focused on the fact that internet radio sites like Pandora, iHeartRadio and many others are becoming major exhibitors for not only just music, but the recording industry itself.  The popularity of streaming internet stations in the car mostly comes from the linking pin of the cellphone industry.  People are able to buy cables that will simply connect their smartphone to the radio.  They won&#8217;t need to buy a full dashboard radio system that will connect their internet radio to the car.  &#8220;It is thought that most of that listening still occurs at home or at work on computers connected to the internet because of the perceived difficulties related to connecting to the internet in the car&#8221; (rbr.com).  When surveys are taken to see how many people are listening to internet radio, we cannot assume that it is just for the car, all these other media outlets still need to be taken into account.</p>
<p>Within the article there are perceptions noted that describe how certain industry and power roles are concerned with these internet radio stations taking over.  The internet might be able to vertically integrate themselves as producers, distributors, and exhibitors due to the fact that our information age has taken rise <em>because</em> of the internet.  To understand the perceptions (or misperceptions) of the internet radio streaming in cars, it would be better to read the <a href="http://www.rbr.com/radio/in-car-streaming-numbers-perceptions-misperceptions-examined.html">article</a> in full.  But in short the four perceptions are: that streaming is not yet happening in the car, once streaming becomes widely available in cars terrestrial radio will be dead, people won&#8217;t pay for an in-dash solution, consumers will want more pre-sets with in-dash systems.</p>
<p>Although this might be a huge exhibitor power role in the future, in-dash internet radio systems need a lot of adjustment to satisfy the consumer.  Although the client power role of the advertisers might see this as a great deal of business for them, only having one automobile producer and distributor for an internet radio system (Ford and its SYNC system) limits the possibility of substantial profit and growth.</p>
