					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Both Spencer and Alex perfectly exemplify what it means to be a student-athlete. Not only are they great people and spectacular basketball players, but both are incredible students. They excel on and off the court and both consistently have one of the highest (if not the highest) GPAs on their respective teams. Go Mules!&lt;/p&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I have been fortunate to watch these two excellent players every year from the best seat in the house, the scorer&#039;s table.  While I don&#039;t know them personally, they both have been a joy to watch and develop into wonderful young adults.  They play with such passion and love for the game, exactly how collegiate athletics should be played!&lt;/p&gt;
