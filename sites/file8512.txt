								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Social Media is a lethal weapon. When hearing this statement some people might be puzzled trying to figure out what it might mean. Although people may feel that social media is amazing for its ability to give each person who it is accessible to a voice, this is far from the case. Facebook and Twitter, two of the most popular social networking sites that we use in our everyday lives are flooded with terroristic propaganda used to help benefit various terrorist organizations. A book published by the United States government titled, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">The Evolution of Terrorist Propaganda: The Paris Attack and Social Media, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> talks about the growing concern over terrorist organizations’ ability to use social media. The book continues to talk about the knowledge that terrorist organizations have as it says, “Terrorists know the benefit of social media. Social Media is easy to use, it is free, and it reaches everyone in the world,”(1). ISIS , who has recently come into view for the United States government and its citizens, uses social media to broadcast their horrible videos that show their terrible acts to the entire world. ISIS uses these videos in an attempt to recruit new members to their “caliphate” not just in the Middle East, but around the world due to the abilities of social media. With a growing terrorist organization presence on Twitter and Facebook, these companies and the United States are faced with a huge dilemma. Should they do whatever it takes to remove all the content posted by terrorist organizations to prevent recruitment or should they leave the content so they can use it for intelligence to help stop the terrorist organizations. The United States and Social Media companies must figure out a strategy to help improve this issue. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As the reading continues, it talks about occurrences where terrorist groups have used social media. Twitter has run into major problems with terrorist groups being on their website such as, “for years Twitter was asked to shut down an account of the foreign terrorist organization al- Shabaab, which pledged allegiance to al-Qaeda,”(2). In 2013, al-Shabaab’s account live tweeted their attack on the Westgate Mall in Kenya that killed 72 people. By Twitter not listening to these complaints, they let a terrorist organization live tweet so the rest of the world was able to see , which could have easily been prevented by Twitter. The reading continued to talk about the negatives of social media saying, “the use of Internet to radicalize and recruit homegrown terrorists is the single most important and dangerous innovation since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Approaches that are aimed at reducing the supply of violent extremist content on the Internet are neither feasible nor desirable.’’ The United States and other nations know that they are fighting a very tough battle against terrorists organization on social networking websites. In my opinion, these sites should look to eliminate every terrorist affiliated page. ISIS’ main strength is its ability to recruit and send messages using social media. I feel that if companies like Facebook and Twitter could cut off ISIS’ ability to use social media, their efforts would be extremely weakened. Having information about terrorist organizations like ISIS by using their posts can be beneficial, but the United States has been very good at knowing where and when ISIS mobilizes and with drone technology they are able to attack without sending military personnel to the battlefield to fight. United States citizens have also began to try to join the ISIS caliphate. Many of these people have been caught before being able to travel to Syria to join, but some have been successful in their efforts. Social media is the reason for this willingness to join ISIS. The United States and social networking websites have made strides to help put an end to terrorist organization’s ability to share their ideas and messages with the world,  but it will be a long, hard battle that the United States and the rest of the world will continue to fight.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Snapchat has quickly become one of the leading social media sites that people use throughout their everyday lives. Although people of all ages use Snapchat, teenagers and others in their early twenties make up most of the user population. With this being the case, the NBA and NFL among other professional sports leagues have decided to bring their own featured content for the users of Snapchat to watch. On days when there is an important sporting event going on such as the MLB playoffs or NBA finals, Snapchat will let users that attend any of these events post real time videos from their phones to the events “My Story”. Snapchat users from all around the world can then watch these snaps in real time to witness the plays and sounds of each event. Snapchat is proving to be the place where teens and other users can get videos and photos that take them closer to sports. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The article that I read discussed why sports fans are using Snapchat for their sports content as opposed to other social media sites such as Facebook or Twitter. Based on my encounters with each of these apps, Snapchat is more easily navigable than any other social media site. While Facebook or Twitter might have one video of a touchdown or amazing play, Snapchat usually has well over 100 seconds of footage if the sporting event has a My Story. With one click of the button short clips of pre-game tailgates,national anthem, fans cheering in the stands, and plays from the game come across the screen without any clicking out or loading another video. With teenagers being labeled as impatient, Snapchat fits the mold perfectly as it is the most effective and quickest way to make yourself feel closer to the actual events of each sport. The article considers that unpredictability is a reason that fans use Snapchat as opposed to Twitter or Facebook. Sports can take a turn in a matter of seconds and one play can change the whole game. The author says that, “the ephemerality of the platform can be alluring. In contrast to Facebook, Twitter, or other social media platforms where a post can live forever, one can cheer when your team scores without worrying about looking dumb if they end up losing,” (Constine, 2014, p.1). On social media websites like Twitter or Facebook, users usually wait until after the event is over to post celebratory things about their teams win because they do not want to jinx or speak too soon. Snapchat is an app that lets people show events happening in real time so this problem does not occur. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With Snapchat being occupied by teenagers and people in their twenties, it will continue to be at the forefront of social media usage and maybe even surpass sites like Twitter and Facebook. Teenagers look to Snapchat and will continue to look to Snapchat to keep up to date with sporting events. With the success that Snapchat has had with leagues like the MLB, NBA, or NFL, it will be only a matter of time before others start showing their content to the users of Snapchat. </span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In 2010, co-founders Travis Kalanick and Garrett Camp released an app that would change transportation forever. With technology growing at a rapid rate as well as apps and social media starting to become increasingly important in everyday life, Uber was created as an easier, quicker, and cheaper way to transport. Starting in only big cities such as New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago, Uber proved to be the mode of transportation that each city was lacking. In New York, the iconic yellow taxi ruled the streets but with such a high demand all the time, finding an unoccupied cab was easier said than done. In a matter of seconds Uber lets each user set their location, destination, gives a fare estimate, and labels what time the cab will arrive at your given destination. Uber gives smartphone users the ability to connect with their driver in the easiest and cheapest way possible. The best part about Uber is not having to directly pay the driver for their services. All payments are linked through a credit or debit card account that charges the passenger once their ride is over. The creation of Uber has changed the way people travel from place to place. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With Uber’s massive success in the United States throughout limited cities, the company decided to expand globally. As of 2015, Uber has launched in 60 cities worldwide including countries all over Asia, Africa, and Europe. Traveling through a foreign country can be extremely difficult in terms of navigation but Uber has given people the ability to not have to be able to communicate in an unfamiliar language in order to get from place to place. With the ability to use your current location and set a destination where you would like to go, Uber has eliminated helplessly looking for historics sites, a restaurant, or any other specific location. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Uber is not just available in big cities but has also branched out to rural and suburb areas. In a small town, rarely does anyone ever see a taxi just driving around looking for a customer and not every small town has a taxi service willing to pick someone up and drive that passenger long distances. Uber has given people in less populated areas the ability to get from place to place at the with just a few taps on their smartphones. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The requirements for becoming an Uber driver include being able to pass a background check as well as having a license and car. Once these tasks are passed, you are free to be an Uber driver. This proves to be one of the reasons along with cheaper prices why Uber is currently taking over cities around the world. In a place like London, it takes up to four years to become a taxi driver. Each candidate must drive around the city on a motorcycle learning all the streets from a book that they are given by the taxi service. In New York, each candidate must attend a training course to become a yellow cab driver. Uber does not require any of these steps which makes people more inclined to become an Uber driver rather than a Taxi company. With Uber’s growing presence in places all over the world, taxi drivers have become more and more irritated by Uber drivers taking their business. Just this summer in Paris, violent protests broke out between Uber drivers and Taxi company drivers. The protests definitely indicate a shift from taxi companies to Uber controlling the roads. With Uber working everyday to improve their services, it&#8217;s only a matter of time before they eliminate taxi companies forever and continue changing the way we travel. </span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Before apps and the internet, people needed to wait to get their news. Newspapers were delivered early in the morning packed front to back with the latest news from the day before. Aside from the nightly news, newspapers were the main way to know what was going on in the world. Mornings were spent reading newspaper articles at the breakfast table while sipping coffee and eating breakfast. Fast forward to the 21st century where people rely on apps such as Twitter to get breaking information at the palm of their hands instead of waiting for the paper boy to deliver the newspaper every morning. With an increasing reliability on apps that provide breaking news whenever and wherever, the use of newspapers is at an all time low and continuing to decline. According to research done by The Future Exploration Network, “Newspapers in their current form will become insignificant in the United States by 2017,” (Gunelius, 2014). The Future Exploration Network’s research has the United States as the first country to forgo newspapers. Soon after their 2017 prediction for the United States, nations such as Iceland, Canada, Norway, England, and Finland will all follow the United States in eliminating newspapers in current form. Gunelius states that the end is definitely approaching for newspapers, “Unless newspapers can find a way to transform their business models, Future Exploration Network’s extinction predictions for newspapers as we know them could come to fruition even sooner. Research keeps showing again and again that the end is near. How soon the end will arrive has yet to be determined,”(Gunelius,2014). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With the extinction of newspapers in their current paper form on the way, no one is able to deny that the world continues to become more and more digital by the day. As I read Gunelius’ article, I thought of how books have gone digital with the Kindle and the ability to download books straight to your smartphone. Schools are starting to use Ipads and and other tablets for reading books instead of having physical copies for students. I believe that books in their current form will not be available in a matter of years just as The Future Exploration Network predicted for newspapers. Huge bookstore chains such as Barnes and Noble have had a huge increase in store closures as a result of the increase in digital purchases of books.  With the digital world becoming increasingly widespread every single day, physical copies of newspapers, books, magazines and other paper produced materials have their days limited.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">       When first starting to read Mike Hanski’s article, the first thing the reader sees is the title in big bold letters, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Want to Be a Better Writer? Read more</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">. Hanski’s persuasion is in full effect in the title. Throughout the article, he lists many different ways that reading can help boost the mind including bringing inspiration, gaining knowledge, and widening vocabulary. Reading gives people an upper edge not just in writing which it does improve greatly but in overall knowledge that you are able to bring to the table in all situations. Knowing more information in various topics will help you be able to engage with many different people from very different backgrounds. Reading more would be beneficial to anyone willing to put in the work. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">        As I first started reading Hanski’s article, I immediately was lured in by his title. I label myself as someone who just reads what he is assigned and does not do any reading for leisure aside from breaking news on my twitter feed and many different types of articles. Who does not want to become a better writer? I clearly do not read enough and this article persuaded me to start reading more than what I am just assigned in school. The influences of reading by itself told me that I should and have to read more. Overcoming stress, keeping the brain in shape while getting older, and broadening of my imagination. Going to a school where writing is very important puts a large emphasis on this article. I need to be a better writer in order to succeed and if I think I am good enough to stop improving, even Stephen King one of the most famous and best selling authors ever credits reading to his writing abilities. “If you don’t have time to read, you don&#8217;t have the time (or the tools) to write. Simple as that,” (P.1) Even Stephen King, a writer with as much ability as he has, reads more to gain inspiration and assist with his writing. Reading is so special because it can help us with so many things and not just writing. Although people may not want to read because it is not convenient or takes up too much time, the benefits are endless and absolutely worth the time it takes. </span></p>
