								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> The term “ownership” in the relatively newly-developed, ever-evolving digital world we live in has begun to take on a different meaning. What was once based on sole physical possession of an item is now beginning to change as the digital world continues to develop and mature.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> It seems there is no such thing as full-ownership in the digital world anymore. Everything we obtain online is essentially just a lease – a lease granting us access to use, borrow, share, and explore. Nothing is truly owned. We are simply claiming something as our own for a specified period of time; however, it is never really ours.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Similar to what occurs in the real world, these possessions can easily be taken away. We can lose licenses and have access revoked to materials because we do not have genuine authority over the content. Which raises several questions. Who really has authority over such material? Who truly owns these products and services? What can be changed to grant us ownership over the content we seek to take ownership of?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> The concept of ownership online is a shady one. There are many complexities associated with it due to the very fact that we do not know who rightly owns the content or material. As Sian Lindley mentioned in her TedTalk, Rethinking ownership in the digital age, we do not know where the borders lie when it comes to our own digital ownership.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Since we often confuse access with ownership and possession we find ourselves giving up rights to large corporations who operate solely for-profit. We are given some control over what we can post and what we decide to share. Realistically, we are deprived of much more in the way of control or protection of our online content. If we try to relinquish ownership we do so with an expectation in can be easily done, since the page is no longer accessible to others eyes. However, because we never truly had ownership the corporation, who is the real owner, still maintains the final decision with respect to what actually becomes of that content.</span></p>
