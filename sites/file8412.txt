								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s bizarre to think of the world without the internet. Society has become so accustomed to the use of it, that it is odd to think that there once was a time that it did not exist. The initial use of technology has now become so prevalent in the work force, that everyone often forgets that not too long ago, it was not available at the tough of your finger tips. You could not just email a presentation to your boss or type up word documents and spreadsheets. These new perks all made their appearance in the late 80s and 90s after the internet was first conceived. Patricia Wallace, the author of <i>The Internet In The Workplace</i>, refers to the internet as a ‘desktop gateway to the world.’ She explains,“It changed the context of work, the context of business in general, and the context of entire industries” (Wallace, 2004, p. 2).</p>
<p>The birth of the internet did indeed create a whole new dynamic of the work place with the help of these new technologies. Patricia discusses how the use of the internet helps assist companies in many ways, the most being the 24/7 access. It’s now possible for an employee to work even when they are not physically sitting in their office. All aspects of a company can be accessed from the outside. Other employees can be contacted, work can be done, and information can be sent to different people. It is also much easier for training new employees. It prevents you from having to waste both time and money. This new learning, e-learning, makes it much easier for both companies and future employees.</p>
<p>Technology has infiltrated the work force, and it is overall for the better. The workplace endured a technological revolution that is increasingly improved it. Some may ask whether that is a positive or negative. Why would it be a negative? It has brought many great aspects to the workforce that were did not exist many year ago.</p>
