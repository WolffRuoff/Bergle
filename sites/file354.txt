In the autumn of 1909, Muhlenberg College opened the Saturday School for Teachers. Twenty students, both male and female, enrolled during the 1909-1910 academic year. The courses taught during that first program included physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics, ancient and modern languages, and English.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The program grew slowly but steadily: in 1915, the first Summer School was established. In addition to traditional academic subjects, courses in agriculture, calisthenics, and domestic science were offered. In 1917, Dr. Isaac Wright became the director of the Department of Philosophy and Pedagogy at Muhlenberg, or what became known as the Extension Division. The program grew rapidly; soon there were more students enrolled in the Extension School than in the regular College. Courses were offered throughout neighboring cities and counties.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When the photograph arrived and we unrolled the curled-up image, we found, right in the middle, the image of a Black woman. This was a revelation, because, according to College records and the archives, the first Black students at Muhlenberg were <a href=\"https:\/\/www.muhlenberg.edu\/blackhistorymonth2017\/thepioneers\/\">five men<\/a> who joined the regular residential College in 1947. Unfortunately, the 1927 photograph is not labeled by student name, and without a name, we couldn&#8217;t query the Registrar\u2019s office for records relating to the Extension School in that period.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-large\"><img data-attachment-id=\"2734\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/trexlerworks.muhlenberg.edu\/trexler_blog\/general-item\/170-years-of-women-on-campus-clara-i-lane\/attachment\/clara_1927_gradient\/#main\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/trexlerworks.muhlenberg.edu\/trexler_blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/Clara_1927_gradient.jpg?fit=260%2C380\" data-orig-size=\"260,380\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;1.8&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;iPhone 8&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1580737159&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;3.99&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;40&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.05&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Clara_1927_gradient\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/trexlerworks.muhlenberg.edu\/trexler_blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/Clara_1927_gradient.jpg?fit=205%2C300\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/trexlerworks.muhlenberg.edu\/trexler_blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/Clara_1927_gradient.jpg?fit=260%2C380\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"260\" height=\"380\" src=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/trexlerworks.muhlenberg.edu\/trexler_blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/Clara_1927_gradient.jpg?resize=260%2C380\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2734\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/trexlerworks.muhlenberg.edu\/trexler_blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/Clara_1927_gradient.jpg?w=260 260w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/trexlerworks.muhlenberg.edu\/trexler_blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/Clara_1927_gradient.jpg?resize=205%2C300 205w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 260px) 100vw, 260px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>When planning for the current exhibit <a href=\"http:\/\/trexler.muhlenberg.edu\/library\/specialcollections\/exhibits\/\"><em>An Innovation Revisited: 170 years of women on campus<\/em><\/a><em>, <\/em>in which we were telling little-known stories of women in Muhlenberg\u2019s history, we thought this would be the perfect time for the anonymous woman to make her debut.

And then we settled in for some old-fashioned historical legwork.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A search of the<em> Morning Call<\/em> from 1927 revealed a reprint of our panoramic photograph, followed by a list of students in the Summer School, along with their towns of residence\u2026..180 women and 201 men. She was somewhere on that list.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We then began cross-referencing the names and towns in the <em>Morning Call<\/em> with the United States census. In addition to names, occupations, addresses, and languages spoken, the census records race. Working through the women\u2019s names alphabetically, we had gotten through about 102&#8211;through the letter \u201cK\u201d&#8211;when we came across Clara I.

She&nbsp;taught elementary school students at both the Pennsylvania and New Jersey Avenue Schools. She appears to have been teaching there when those schools were legally ordered to desegregate in the late 1920s. According to the <em>Morning Call<\/em>, she attended not only the 1927 Muhlenberg Summer School, but also the 1926 class. The 1930 census still lists her occupation as \u201cteacher;\u201d by this time she had married John R. Major, an Atlantic City mortician, and given birth to her first daughter, Beryl. A second daughter, LaVeida, followed in 1932.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to a fragment of an obituary appearing in the<em> Morning Call, <\/em>Clara passed away in January, 1936, and was interred in Atlantic City. The cause of death is unknown, and further research in the microfilmed archives of Atlantic City newspapers is needed to learn more. Clara\u2019s daughters went on to college, one graduating from West Virginia State University, an HBCU, and one attending Moravian College for one year. Both daughters appear to have spent time living with their grandmother in Bethlehem. After 1960, their names disappear from all readily-available sources.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We plan to continue to search for resources that shed light on Clara\u2019s life, and perhaps someday help us locate her descendants. For now, we can assert that Clara Lane was Muhlenberg College\u2019s first known Black student.\u00a0<br><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>By Susan Falciani Maldonado, Special Collections and Archives Librarian During the spring semester of 2020, we will be offering a series of blog posts that highlight little-known stories of women who have played a role in Muhlenberg&#8217;s history.
