<p>Clear Channel Radio (1, March, 2011). <span style="font-family: Helvetica;font-size: 12px">Clear Channel Radio Announces Acquisition of Thumbplay’s Cloud-Based Music Business. Retrieved from <a href="http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20110228007392/en/Clear-Channel-Radio-Announces-Acquisition-Thumbplay’s-Cloud-Based">http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20110228007392/en/Clear-Channel-Radio-Announces-Acquisition-Thumbplay’s-Cloud-Based</a></span></p>
<p>Leading our country&#8217;s digital and terrestrial radio, Clear Channel Radio has added a new technical function to their growing iHeartRadio.  Thumbplay Inc. is a new cloud-based technology that is being combined to CC&#8217;s iHeartRadio which has 750 channels in 150 cities, released on March 1, 2011.  iHeartRadio has been recently launched, but it is assumed to be the leading online/mobile radio station of our century.  This site is offering music that is streaming/downloading for a monthly subscription of $9.99 a month.  A pandora-like station, Thumbplay music is controlled by its listeners.  Radio stations stream with no commercials, and music can be added to a customized playlist.<span id="more-961"></span></p>
<p>Not only is Clear Channel enhancing their exhibitor role, they are using the auxiliary power role of Thumbplay&#8217;s cloud-based technology.  They are reaching the ideals of collaboration with local radio stations, which is needed for local radio stations to survive.  Not only are listeners able to create their own playlists, they are still able to stream their favorite local radio stations from their iPhone, Android, Blackberry&#8217;s, and Windows 7 phones.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thumbplay (which charges 9.99 per month) will also give Clear Channel the capability to deploy a variety of subscription services as it moves to leverage its radio assets across all digital platforms, including the Internet, automotive and mobile devices. Remember, <a href="http://www.rbr.com/features/ideas-working-now/clear-channels-iheartradio-hits-the-road.html" target="_blank">Toyota will integrate Clear Channel’s iheartradio</a> mobile app into select models starting this year.&#8221;  Not only does this show a linking-pin to the automotive industry, it establishes Thumbplay as a huge exhibitor role, also as client based because of the subscription money needed to support it.  John Hogan, CEO of Clear Channel, states in his business release that &#8220;iHeartRadio will build on our position as the leaders in digital radio, offering an unparalleled combination of features and reach &#8212; to our listeners, advertisers, artists, music labels, and other partners – not available anywhere else.&#8221;</p>
