								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Andy Yen discusses the role of privacy in today’s technologically driven society and how it has become almost nonexistent. His Ted Talk entitled, <em>Think your email’s private? Think again.</em> focuses on the matter of email and how many people are blind to the fact that all emails are visible to the public. Everything on the internet creates data, and what’s alarming is the notion that, “our data now lasts forever, so your data can and will outlive you.” (Yen, 2014) Data not only reveals personal information about us, but also indicates who we interact with, where we are, and what we think about. This summation of data open to the public officially deteriorates the concept of privacy, for the new generation of digital natives are taught to share everything about themselves online.</p>
<p>With regard to email, Yen makes an interesting comparison to postcards. He discusses how emails are not private and are the equivalent of sending a postcard, since, “everybody that sees it from the time it leaves your computer to when it gets to the recipient can actually read the entire contents.” (Yen, 2014) This observation is alarming because if the entire internet can read your emails, the comparison to text messaging must be analogous. Invasion of privacy has become such an integral part of this digital generation that it raises the fear of becoming a new social norm. The uses of this bank of information and data is endless. The government is the obvious thought that comes to mind when posing the question of, “Who’s listening or watching on the other end?” Next comes big businesses and all of their marketing tactics to sell personalized products to us, however, besides the government and big business, who else has an interest in our lives? It’s an important question to ask ourselves when choosing what we post online.</p>
<p>Yen proposes a way to secure our information to prevent the public from gaining access to our emails. The solution that already exists is called encryption, however common people do not have the skillset to execute that process. What Andy and his team of scientists developed is an app entitled ProtonMail. Created in the cafeteria of the European Organization for Nuclear Research, CERN, ProtonMail enables the average person to send automatically encrypted emails without the, “server being able to read what’s going on”, or the user seeing the encryption. To the users, they are emailing their friends and family as normal, however the emails are not open to the public to read or save as data. It is quite genius how Andy and his team made the extremely complicated process of encryption into an easy app that allows individuals to ensure their privacy and live without the eyes of the public watching their every move.</p>
<p>ProtonMail is beneficial because privacy has become a foreign concept in this digital age. This app makes privacy an option for the average person who otherwise would not know or understand how to encrypt his/her emails. Andy’s activism towards privacy reform is inspiring and significant to the movement because he emphasizes how if, “we want to have privacy online, what we have to do is we’ve got to go out and get it ourselves.” (Yen, 2014) It’s an absurd concept, the act of fighting for our privacy. Privacy should be a basic human right, for I thought it was very clearly protected in the Fourth Amendment. However, through manipulation and corruption within the marketing industry and federal government, people have found loopholes to gain access to our entire lives which have now essentially been posted online. The lack of privacy in this world is a, “global issue that impacts all of us&#8230;We have to build an Internet where privacy is no longer just an option, but is also the default.” (Yen, 2014) Through people like Andy, the fight for privacy is gaining extensive support. It has surpassed just the development of new technological innovations and has become a fierce confrontation with the oppression of human rights.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The post apocalyptic novel, <u>Brave New World</u> by Aldous Huxley, discusses how the misuse and abuse of technology can lead to the disintegration of creativity and independent thinking. Specific to Chapter Sixteen, Mustapha Mond provides the reader with more insight into his role as world controller and confronts Bernard, Helmholtz, and John the Savage about their looming fate of being removed from civilization due to their extensive knowledge. Mustapha Mond opens up about his past and reveals that he used to be a scientist himself, for he was given the same threat of being sent to an isolated island. Instead of removing himself from society, Mond became a world controller and since then has been conditioning his citizens to conform to various social classes, each one being emotionless, imprisoning, and filled with people who are constantly inebriated.</p>
<p>The key elements of this society are happiness and stability, for each social class is articulately devised to be content working on the tasks they are told to complete. For example, “Only an Epsilon can be expected to make Epsilon sacrifices, for the good reason that for him they aren’t sacrifices; they’re the line of least resistance” (Huxley, 1932). This medical intervention of human reproduction produces babies made to contribute to society in a specific way, there is no room for self discovery or liberty and everything has a prescribed method with no room for spontaneity. People are not able to freely express themselves, for their emotions are stripped away, leaving them in a constant state of “happiness”. But what is happiness if there is no unhappiness? Huxley parallels the themes of power and technology, for in the brave new world these go hand in hand. The government controls the technology and therefore, also the minds and actions of every person.</p>
<p>John argues with Mond over the concept of “old”, for John doesn’t understand why he’s the only person who appreciates Shakespeare and literature. Mond explains how when the past is beautiful, it takes people out of the present and more importantly, out of the future. People gain a basis of thought by looking back into the past. They are able to hear about the past, form an opinion about it, and decide how they want to proceed in the future. The old influences the new. It provokes collaboration, inspiration, and influences the way people think and creatively express themselves. Mond specifically points out how new scientific development leads to instability, for he believes that, “every discovery in pure science is potentially subversive; even science must sometimes be treated as a possible enemy&#8230;Science is dangerous; we have to keep it most carefully chained and muzzled.” (Huxley, 1932) This claim highlights Huxley’s growing dissatisfaction with government involvement in scientific and creative expression, for the more power a government has over technology and the human masses, the more corruption is prevalent. Objects, ideas, and discoveries that are old give people a sense of nostalgia, memory, and physical thought. Mond’s goal is to eliminate thinking and enforce the values of short term gratification provided by drugs, technology, and sex. Mond uses technology and hypnopaedic conditioning to breed these brainwashed, thoughtless people and design them to only want more, to only want new, to move from partner to partner in a mindless and routinely fashion. Huxley shines a light on this over-involvement of governmental policy on the human body to depict the consequences of what happens when the progression of science and art are tampered with. With a society blindly following the technology controlled by the government, manipulation pervades the mind of each individual and creates a mass of absentminded robots.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The concepts of identity, self-promotion, and manipulation of an intended audience are significant aspects of the Twitter world. Users have become addicted to the “micro-celebrity” (Marwick 121) social status and are feeding off of their, “audience that they can strategically maintain through ongoing communication and interaction” (Marwick 121). It’s interesting to see the different goals that each Twitter user has in mind when posting tweets for the public to see. Some users, such as giant corporations, use specific marketing tactics to manipulate users and appeal to a niche’s specific interests. “Soraya Darabi, the social media strategist for the New York Times, said, ‘I’m constantly aware of my followers.’” (Marwick 126) She is the perfect example of what it looks like to have an inauthentic goal in mind when tweeting, for she creates an explicit social image for the sole purpose of gaining followers and possible fiscal rewards. Soraya Darabi does not use Twitter for her own personal self expression, her decision, “to reveal personal information”, is, “strategic, and often framed as a way to reinforce relationships with followers” (Marwick 127). This contrasts with individuals who do not have a lot of followers because their “audience awareness”, does not, “factor greatly into their writing” (Marwick 116). Twitter users who do not have many followers “see Twitter as a personal space” (Marwick 124), in which authenticity is maintained and balanced with impression management.</p>
<p>The audience also plays a large role in the kinds of tweets produced. Since users can not actually comprehend the extent of their audience, “a tweets actual readers differ from its producer’s imagined audience” (Marwick 117). Between other social platforms that allow the share feature, tweets can be seen on countless, “communication channels” (Marwick 117), which can be daunting to the Twitter user but also be used to one’s advantage. There are many different perspectives on the kinds of tweets on the internet. Factors such as censorship, the intended audience, and the appeal to multiple audiences are all taken into consideration while tweeting. This is important to Twitter users because they do not want to be chastised for a specific tweet that was posted but then shared to an unintended audience that does not agree with the user’s views.</p>
<p>While the knowledge of having an intended audience is very important for successful Twitter users, the ability to navigate multiple twitter communities also comes into play when focusing on identity. The phenomenon of context collapse describes how the requirement to display a, “verifiable, singular identity makes it impossible to differ self-presentation strategies, creating tension as diverse groups of people flock to social network sites (boyd, 2008)” (Marwick 122). The public can not tell the difference between self-promotion and commercialization versus one’s authentic self and personal expression. Erving Goffman highlights the interesting analogy between twitter users and actors, for each tweet is a performance intended for a specific audience and group of people, especially noting the fact that, “self-presentation is collaborative” (Marwick 123). Just the way an actor can not perform without an audience, a twitter user can not post a tweet without a group of people to see and interact with it. This public presentation of various narrative can lead to criticism, “encourage social norms” (Marwick 123), and provoke an unwanted reputation for a given user. These consequences of tweeting reinforce the idea of, “’impression management’” (Marwick 123), but also sheds a light on the relationship between social media and identity and how people can accidentally create an unwanted identity for themselves.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>SoundCloud has become an underground music source for people around the world. It was established in Sweden by Swedish music artists as a collaborative tool. However, SoundCloud eventually developed into a mechanism of self promotion and distribution catered towards bands and vocalists. One of the main attributes that makes SoundCloud attractive to so many people is that it’s completely free to use the website. Money is a significant problem among music artists. The lack of fiscal stress enables people to explore and pursue their music careers freely and from an international platform. In addition to the cost effective nature of SoundCloud, its initial release in 2011 was simultaneous with the popularity of tablets and mobile browsing. Wikipedia states that in 2012, “the new SoundCloud version was released to the general public…The enhanced platform offered new features such as: redesigned profiles; more sharing options; real-time notifications…” (Wikipedia, 2015), etc. These enhanced visualizations and connectivity between SoundCloud’s users made the website and app initially less appealing to the public, but statistically gained higher ratings than ever before.</p>
<p>One of the most significant contributions to SoundCloud as a global company was the partnership with Twitter in 2013. Many people had doubts about the credibility of SoundCloud when, “talks with major music labels about licensing…did not amount to anything substantial”, for the, “negotiation process was initiated in an attempt to avoid the problems faced by Google” (Wikipedia, 2015) about copyrighted material. However, with Twitter’s newfound stake in the company, SoundCloud started to appear to the social media community as a company to be taken seriously. Through ads, royalty agreements, and participation between various music labels, artists, and specifically Warner Music, SoundCloud has been able to handle the conflict of copyright and has officially dominated the music scene throughout the world.</p>
<p>As a young vocalist, SoundCloud makes pursuing a career in music more easily attainable. It allows artists to have complete control over their work and easily spread it around the world. Its combined use of sharing throughout various social media sites, such as Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr, and Google Plus, makes self promotion and self-acclaimed fame possible and imaginable. It’s the American Dream want to start a business from scratch and make a fortune from it. This social media tool makes it possible for artists to do just that, and to do it themselves about something they’re passionate about.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the article, <em>Social Media Is Redefining ‘Depression’, </em>Bine discusses how Tumblr has become a major platform for teenage girls with mental illness to express themselves publicly in an anonymous way. Tumblr is a form of social media that was developed to promote photography and blogging through pictures. Bine interviews a teenage girl named Laura who has fell victim to the massive online Tumblr community that accepts her for her depression. Bine mentions the Silver Bubble Problem, in which it is, “difficult for those inside the community to see the outside world…But they often don’t want to get out because to leave the community would be to lose the people who understand them.” (Bine 2013, p. 4) While being accepted though, Laura’s identity is still able to remain hidden from the people she knows in the outside world. This anonymity produces its own safety in knowing that “nobody” will find out about what you post. Bine goes on to discuss how a combination of intense feelings, misunderstanding, and a closed off online community all contribute to the exponential rise in depression throughout this upcoming generation.</p>
<p>Yes, Depression combined with an online community of other depressed people is leading to a glorification of a serious mental health issue. When depressed teenagers take to Tumblr, it leads to a, “growing community of people feeding off of each other’s strong emotions, and it’s definitely visible online.” (Bine 2013, p. 3) And yes, it is definitely accurate to say that not everyone who reblogs depressing imagery is clinically depressed themselves and many “adolescents are confusing the clinical disorder called ‘depression’ with normal, everyday challenges.” (Bine 2013, p. 2) However, when Tumblr users feel almost, “strong, beautiful, and mysterious” (Bine 2013, p. 2) for posting, “black and white photos with scars along their wrists, from taking razor blades to their skin” (Bine 2013, p. 1) and are recognized and most infamously, praised for it, this is where the problem of interpretation begins.</p>
<p>Bine is ignorantly incorrect to state that the self expression pertaining to depression has created a, “frenzy” (Bine 2013, p. 2) on Tumblr, for she thinks girls are giving into peer pressure and are self-harming because it is the cool thing to do. It is extremely offensive for Bine to label this social phenomenon as people who are, “‘wannabe depressed’” (Bine 2013, p. 2). Nobody wants to be depressed.  This insensitive label invalidates an adolescent’s emotions, which is all he/she really wants from posting on Tumblr in the first place. This is the problem. The controversy is in the way that these feelings are being expressed and the validity that comes with them. Teenage girls are being praised for being depressed, which turns depression into something that is normal or healthy. Teenagers are aloud to express themselves on the internet, but when it comes to mental illness, there should be a community focusing on recovery and support. Bine misinterprets and invalidates these depression blogs as teenagers, “advertising their suffering.” (Bine 2013, p. 5) She misses the point completely, and doesn’t realize that these teens are going through a difficult time and are simply calling for help through the only tool they feel comfortable with, the internet. The conversation of handling depression is very important in this day and age, however, it must be emphasizing healthy and appropriate ways to treat and overcome depression, not casting it off as an indulgent frenzied phenomenon.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hanski demonstrates that reading and writing are both necessary for the development of each other. It is not possible for either reading or writing to stand alone in each one’s own separate world. They are harmonious entities that build off one another to promote the power of knowledge and the discussion of morality. Every book has meaning and a message for an intended audience because, “every author writes for readers” (Hanski, 2014, p. 2). According to Hanski (2014), “Everything you learn as a reader, you can use as a writer afterward” (p. 2). The vocabulary and imagination that come with reading allow young minds to unconsciously think about writing. Writers are storytellers. They introduce new worlds and use society as a stepping ground to formulate social opinions and spread word of their ideologies. Readers are crucial to the survival of writers because there is not one without the other.</p>
<p>Reading and writing also effect our perceptions of the world and promote morality and development among all ages of readers. Hanski (2014) states that, “reading helps kids define who they are, as it connects them to the rest of the world” (p. 2). Reading provides knowledge of not only the world, but also of the self. With knowledge comes power, and for children to feel that power at an early age will lead them into a strong and morally conscious future. Reading provokes passion and imagination, essential for a successful life of education and learning. Literacy rates prove that, “poor reading skills can lead to a person’s social exclusion” (Hanski, 2014, p. 2). Those who are literate have a universal understanding of mankind, as compared to those who are illiterate. Illiteracy during high school has proven to result in unemployment, “most likely…by the age of 30” (Hanski, 2014, p. 2). This statistic demonstrates how crucial the incorporation of reading into one’s education is for the development of the mind and one’s advancement in writing skill.</p>
<p>Hanski’s use of transition words significantly emphasize his point pertaining to the positive effect of reading on one’s writing skill. His repetitious nature further promotes the impact of his thesis, specifically when he uses the words, “becoming”, “influences”, “impact”, “expand”, “improving”, (Hanski, 2014, p. 2) and so on. These words shine a literary spotlight on the importance of reading and writing, for they help develop his cause and help the reader understand that reading is a process that only gets better with time. Writing is not a skill that can be mastered overnight. Writing is a complex system that utilizes reading as its base and builds upon that base with experience. A person can never read too many books because reading and writing constantly change, developing as people get older and developing in itself as the literary world evolves.</p>
