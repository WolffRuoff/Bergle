								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My name is Melina Economos, and I am the 2018 Sedehi Diversity Project student director.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am so lucky and excited to be able to say that because this project means so much to me. After being a part of the project last year in the ensemble, I knew I needed to be involved in any way I could this year. I am so thankful to be able to be a part of the project again this year as the student director. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But enough about me. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the great joys of working on SDP is the chance to work with some amazing humans. And let me tell you, I am already soooo proud of them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the next week, get ready to hear from each of our ensemble members. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, don&#8217;t forget to check back in with this blog, the vlog, and the Instagram to hear more from me and the ensemble!  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vlog Weeks 1-2: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HV8zIfsG78&amp;t=2s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HV8zIfsG78&amp;t=2s</a></span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The past three weeks with my fellow SDP cast members have been so fun and full of adventure! I celebrated my birthday with these wonderful people and they got me an ice cream cake (my absolute favorite). I’m so happy that I’m able to have fun with these people but also learn and work with them as well. Each day is a new experience and a new opportunity to earn something because everyone is involved in such different things which allows different perspectives to come together. I’ve had so much fun in the village laughing and eating hummus with friends, but I’ve also had conversations with them about everything from the problematic occurrences on RuPaul’s Drag Race to the decision to add shades of brown to the pride flag in Philly. It’s been really cool to have the chance to gain knowledge about different things not just during the hours of rehearsal, but outside of that as well.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reflecting on SDP this summer has been challenging because I don’t feel I will find the right words to sum up my incredible experience, the people, the work, and the project. Here is an incomplete list of the things I will take away from SDP. This list is incomplete because I am still figuring things out as the project moves along, and I don’t plan on stopping these critical reflections even after the project comes to a close. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">1.Challenge Yourself to Always Be More Intersectional </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can never stop learning. You can however listen to people and take in as many perspectives as you can. Listen to people who are not like you. Recognize your own privileges and how your experiences are going to be different from people with different identity markers. Recognize that institutions treat these differences differently because of these privileges or marginalized identities. Recognize that the intersectionality of identities make these experiences nuanced and individual. Find patterns in these multiple experiences. Use this knowledge to resist complacency. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Think Critically Beyond Your Own Experience </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your experience is not universal. Along the lines of the last step, this is a more critical look at stepping outside of your own experiences. Your experiences are valid, and you can most definitely use them to take the first steps outside yourself. You are a body in a diverse world, and it is vital to connect with one another. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, my experiences as a white queer woman on campus will be different from the experiences of queer women of color on campus and outside of Muhlenberg. This means for me that I need to be conscious of the spaces I occupy and the identity of those spaces. I am Vice President of SQuAd (Students for Queer Advocacy) this year, and it is my responsibility to make sure this space is a safe place for all queer students especially for queer students of color and other queer students who are not like me. Queer is an inclusive identity marker, and my LGBTQ+ activism needs to be inclusive to all. And more broadly, my activism and allyship needs to be inclusive and intersectional. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Collaboration Beyond Theatre  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a theatre major, I am used to collaboration. But collaboration is not just a tool of the theatre, it as a necessity of community building that can be used in other areas of campus. As a member of Multicultural Life, I am looking forward to collaborating with the different affinity groups housed under the Multicultural Center. But something that I hope to put into action this coming year is collaboration and community building beyond multi. Potential collaborations between Greek Life, Athletics, academic clubs, MTA, MDA, and other activity groups could provide fruitful connections across campus. We need to have strong communities now, and there is power in strong bonds.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Milk and Cookies are Sometimes Necessary (aka Remember Self Care)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is also wicked important to take care of yourself. Self care is being inspired by a fellow ensemble members’ dedication to going to the gym. Self care is going to Giant to buy ice cream for you and your suitemates. Self care is pushing yourself outside of your comfort zone but recognizing when you need to take a step back. Self care is having milk and cookies after a long day of fulfilling work. Self care is wearing a fun outfit to boost confidence. Self care is setting reminders on your phone because sometimes you need an extra push or help on any given day. Self care is taking a walk in the park and enjoying the company of new friends. Self care is surrounding yourself with people who support your passions. Self care is taking care of your physical and mental well being. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. A Call to Action </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The work we have done over the past month has only reinvigorated my desire to be more active in my activism and allyship. I want to do more. I don’t want to become complacent with my inaction and my silence. Change is made by those willing to put in the work. And it is work. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">6. Resist</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resist. Resist. Resist. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resist the normalization of hatred and bigotry. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resist the normalization of white supremacy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resist the normalization of anti-semitism and xenophobia.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resist the normalization of homophobia and transphobia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resist the normalization of being uninformed and uncritical of our nation’s politics.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resist the temptation of passivity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resist the erasure of your body. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resist the silencing of your voice. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Peace and Love, </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Melina Economos </span></p>

<p>The hardest thing I’ve had to do for the diversity project is this, writing a blog post. It’s not that there aren’t hundreds of awesome things to discuss and expand upon, or that you know I’m not adept at expressing myself via words. My problem lies with the knowledge that over these past few weeks we have done amazing things behind the scenes and I honestly don’t want to share it with others haha. Alas, we don’t get what we want and so I’ll share tidbits of a few things we’ve done that have been cool. We’ve shared in the delightfully delicious and mouthwatering goodness of Winston’s Beef Patties, we’ve chowed down on some great pizza, and have experienced the unique brand of sleep deprivation entirely unique to college students. We’ve sat and held rehearsal  through a raging storm with heavy rainfall that created flash floods, howling winds and lightning piercing the sky. Part of the ensemble got together in my room and watched a movie called&#8212;-don’t say it, don’t think it, don’t say it, don’t think it, don’t say it, don’t think it, the “Bye Bye Man”. This movie was hilarious, partly because despite being so comedic with half formed secondary characters, awkward stares and mediocre dialogue, it still persisted in trying to come across as serious..</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="m_9061463970549682934m_4544268172302820310gmail-docs-internal-guid-94d59e83-f66e-ac7e-18e6-d70c1a416305">I was going to write this blog post as an impersonal, practical, easy-to-write listicle. It was going to be about what I learned through the project as it relates to allyship and activism, to difference, to identities that don’t necessarily align with mine (to clarify, these things are all super important to me and fundamental to the incredible time I’ve had thus far working on SDP). But I had a really bad day today and it showed me that I have every reason to make this post personal, impractical, and sappy as all hell.</p>
<p>More than anything, SDP has taught me the value of an ensemble when it comes to making a thing. I’ve, at some points in my life, struggled with control issues. I’m a perfectionist when it comes to my own creative work, not settling until I have just the right word or just the right note or just the right anything else that would mean whatever I’m working on meets my own very high self-standards. SDP has given me the unique position of being a contributor rather than solely a creator. Being here has taught me the value of killing your darlings&#8211; sometimes, something you love is better off not making it into your finished product because it doesn’t fit the vibe of whatever you’re putting out. It’s taught me the value of listening and responding to the people you’re working with. Everyone here is brilliant, and, I’m amazed at the awesome ideas and just WORDS that come out of every member of the ensemble when they’re on a roll.</p>
<p>(I love words. The SDP ensemble has great words. By transitivity (I think? I don’t love math like I love words), I love them).</p>
<p>I couldn’t have asked for a better ensemble of people to do The Project with. There are legitimate family dynamics being made here. No one necessarily fits a specific function as a family member (Mom and Dad can be Older Sister and Older Brother and Cool Aunt and Weird Uncle in the same breath that they are Mom and Dad), but the unit strengthens day by day. I feel comfortable and safe around the other members of the ensemble, without exception. I was shocked at how quickly these bonds formed&#8211; I was barely friends with anyone coming in, but, by night two, I already felt at home. It’s amazing what living together will do to bond you real quick.</p>
<p>I’m mostly just in awe of how awesomely generous, kind, and talented my fellow ensemble members are. They’re wonderful collaborators and friends and I’m so glad I have them on my side as we all navigate this wild, turbulent, political world together going forward.</p>
<p>I hope everybody loves the show as much as we’ve loved making it.</p>
<p>Love,</p>
<p>Sarah Jae</p>
