				<p>Everybody knows that Thanksgiving is an American holiday. A VERY American holiday. So what does an American kid do in Italy for an American holiday? She eats massive amounts of turkey and spring rolls, sings Queen with her sister and friends, and is overwhelmed with thankfulness and love. That&#8217;s what she does.</p>
<p>This year Thanksgiving was definitely bitter sweet. I have never felt so lucky to be here and missed home so much all at once. Luckily though I had my Momma and Sister to experience the love of the villa and the celebrations that only the Accademia could have.</p>
<p>The day started out as any other day here with hours and hours of class and silliness. I went into town after our last class to go pick up my Momma and Sister from their hotel and brought them back to the transformed villa for dinner.</p>
<div id="attachment_3585" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/12/Jordantgives.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3585" class="size-medium wp-image-3585" src="http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/12/Jordantgives-300x300.jpg" alt="Jordan!" width="300" height="300" srcset="http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/12/Jordantgives-300x300.jpg 300w, http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/12/Jordantgives-150x150.jpg 150w, http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/12/Jordantgives-1024x1024.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-3585" class="wp-caption-text">Jordan!</p></div>
<p>When I say transformed I mean TRANSFORMED! There were so many people here and a lovely poster of all of our Turkey hands that we had made throughout the day. The Mensa was all decorated with candles on the tables and beautiful cakes. It really felt like Thanksgiving here, except I now had a beautiful new family to share it with.</p>

<p>That night, after stuffing our faces with turkey and pumpkin pie, I had to say goodbye to my Momma and Sister because they were leaving for the airport early Friday morning. I didn&#8217;t expect it to be so hard to say goodbye to them, especially because I am going to see them in just a few short weeks (AHHHH!!!! ALL OF THE FEELS), but it was really hard to see them drive down the hill in the Taxi.</p>
<p>Overall Thanksgiving was definitely not like it usually is, but it was still spectacular, just in a different way. They work so hard to make us feel at home here and I could not have asked for a better Arezzo Family. I can&#8217;t believe that it is already after Thanksgiving and that I will soon be leaving this magical place, but I am and will always be thankful for my time here and the incredible people I have met!</p>
<p>Until Next Time, Ciao!</p>
<p>P.S. Just thought I should share a look into the crazy life I am living!</p>

<p>This year our parents decided to take us to three thanksgiving dinners. Yes, you read that correctly… three dinners. Because it is totally necessary to visit all relatives on every holiday! At least I won’t be hungry for a week…</p>
<p>So, my brother and I decided to go on a post-thanksgiving dinner walk to combat our twin food babies.</p>

					<div class="entry-content">
				<p>One of my least favorite things about being from St. Thomas is that over breaks there&#8217;s always this question hanging around in the back of my mind: Where am I going to go?</p>
<p>I usually stay at some friends house for the shorter breaks (i.e. Fall Break), but for Thanksgiving, I always feel weird joining in. I mean, yes, they may say I&#8217;m more than welcome to join, but its Thanksgiving, it&#8217;s a time to spend with your family, and I&#8217;m not family.</p>
<p>This Thanksgiving though I decided to pay a visit to my father in Chicago&#8230; now the question was: How am I going to get there?</p>
<p>The closest airport to Muhlenberg is the Allentown-Bethlehem airpot (airport code ABE) and the prices are never reasonable.</p>
<p>I checked out buses that go to airports further away and looked at both Transbridge Buslines and Bieber Bus. I&#8217;ve taken Transbridge before so I always feel more comfortable taking that one.</p>
<p>I realized I could take the 7:15am bus out of the station (located at 325 Hamilton Street&#8211; not Blvd&#8230; I&#8217;ve made that mistake before and missed my bus because I ended up at the wrong location) and then arrive at the Newark airport for 9:40, which would be perfect because the flight I was eyeing left EWR at 11:50&#8230;</p>
<p>After my ticket was purchased (thanks dad!) I had to find a ride to the station. As a freshman, I would have taken a taxi (O/W ride to the station from Berg costs only about $12.50 +tip), but since I am a junior and most of my friends have cars I was able to ask around and find a ride (thanks Nikki!).</p>
<p>Problem solved!</p>
<p>There are many ways to get to airports from &#8216;Berg if you do not want to pay for a ticket out of ABE, there will be a lot of juggling around and it&#8217;s best to travel as light as possible, but you know the saying, if there&#8217;s a will, there&#8217;s a way! Buying tickets out of JFK and EWR are much much much more affordable than buying a ticket out of ABE, so if I have to take a 2 hour bus ride, so be it.</p>
<p>Now getting back will be trickier. I&#8217;ll be waiting around the airport for about an hour before the bus stops for pickup, I just need to find out where exactly the bus picks up because if I miss it, I&#8217;ll have to wait around for another 3 hours and that is not happening.</p>
<p>Another thing to be cautious about is buying tickets. There is no ticket booth at Newark so you have to pay in cash with exact change, or you need to buy a ticket in advance from a location with a ticket booth (a R/T ticket from Allentown to EWR costs $45). I made the mistake once of not buying a R/T ticket and then not having exact change. Luckily, the bus driver was able to give me change back after the next few stops since others paid in cash.</p>
<p>Another thing you need to pay attention to is the schedule, as you probably know (or don&#8217;t know depended on where you&#8217;ve lived) , there&#8217;s a different schedule for the weekends and the afternoon times are bolded online. I remember once freshman year, I asked one of the admissions counselors for a ride to the bus station so I could catch my flight and when we looked at the schedule we didn&#8217;t realize that the afternoon times were bolded. We waited for about an hour confused before we both realized our mistake (oops). I made the bus and caught my flight just in time, but it was confusing. Good times :)&#8230;</p>
<p>Speaking of admissions counselors, they are always willing to help out, especially if they know you are from far away. They are so genuine and caring, and it&#8217;s always heartwarming talking to them knowing that someone is looking out for you. Right before I left for break one of them emailed me asking to stop by. First I was confused and thought something had happened, but then I got there and she was just making sure I had a place to go over Thanksgiving, it was really sweet! And if you do stay on campus, they usually invite you over so you won&#8217;t be stuck on campus all day and night. How nice is that?</p>
<p>Well that&#8217;s all I have for you all today!</p>
<p>Until next time,</p>
<p>Felisa</p>

				<p>Way way way back in September I remember getting a text from my mom saying that she had booked the flights and hotel for a visit over Thanksgiving week. I also remember getting excited for a couple minutes and then putting that on the back burner because, hey, November was an entire world away. Well folks, here we are.</p>
<div id="attachment_3573" style="width: 235px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/11/IMG_0031.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3573" class="size-medium wp-image-3573" src="http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/11/IMG_0031-225x300.jpg" alt="Momma and Maya in Florence" width="225" height="300" srcset="http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/11/IMG_0031-225x300.jpg 225w, http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/11/IMG_0031-768x1024.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-3573" class="wp-caption-text">Momma and Maya in Florence</p></div>
<p>My mom and sister arrived in Florence this past Saturday after a long night of travels and I could not have been more excited to see them! I know that I am of course missing things while I am here in Italy, but seeing my sister and how much had changed in just a few months made me seriously realize that I have been missing a lot.</p>
<div id="attachment_3572" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/11/IMG_0048.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3572" class="size-medium wp-image-3572" src="http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/11/IMG_0048-300x300.jpg" alt="She is all grown up and I can't handle it" width="300" height="300" srcset="http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/11/IMG_0048-300x300.jpg 300w, http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/11/IMG_0048-150x150.jpg 150w, http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/11/IMG_0048-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/11/IMG_0048.jpg 2004w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-3572" class="wp-caption-text">She is all grown up and I can&#8217;t handle it</p></div>
<p>After a quick reunion at the airport we headed back to the train station so we could get back to Arezzo by a decent hour. We got back to Arezzo around 5pm but the hotel was a tad harder to find then we had anticipated so we didn&#8217;t really get settled until around 6/6:30 BUT we did it! The hotel they are staying in is AMAZING! It is owned by a dad and his two kids, and it could not be cuter or more homey. There is breakfast every morning with the family and according to my mom &#8220;the best espresso you will ever have&#8221; (I can&#8217;t really speak to this because I don&#8217;t drink coffee). After grabbing dinner that first night at Istanbul Kabab (because duh, where else would I take my family for their first meal in Italy&#8230;) I put them both to sleep and headed to see one of my professors perform with her theatre troupe at a local art space.</p>
<p>The next day we headed back to Florence to see the city and get some Christmas shopping done. It was really cool to get to be the tour guide for once and show my family around this place that I have been living for three months. We walked a ton and went to as many sights as possible before grabbing a super quick lunch and headed back to Arezzo for the night because we had a busy Monday on the schedule.</p>
<div id="attachment_3574" style="width: 235px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/11/mayaduomo.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3574" class="size-medium wp-image-3574" src="http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/11/mayaduomo-225x300.jpg" alt="I know, I know, we look nothing alike but I SWEAR we are sisters (and yes I am the older one even though I am much much shorter)" width="225" height="300" srcset="http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/11/mayaduomo-225x300.jpg 225w, http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/11/mayaduomo-768x1024.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-3574" class="wp-caption-text">I know, I know, we look nothing alike but I SWEAR we are sisters (and yes I am the older one even though I am much much shorter)</p></div>
<p>No matter how much I can talk about how the Arezzo program is a conservatory physical theatre program and describe all of the classes we take and all of the professors we have, there is no substitution for actually being here and participating in a class. I was so excited to be able to share what my life has been here with my momma and sister. They sat in on a voice, movement, and physical comedy class, all of which left me exhausted. It was really cool to see how my mom reacted to my professors (because she is a teacher too!) and I loved that they really got to see first hand what I have been doing with my life while away from home. Now they know the full extent of the craziness (but actually) that has been my life for the past three months. Along with sitting in on classes my family got to eat with all of us in the Mensa for lunch and dinner. I think they might have been a little overwhelmed by the sheer volume of our little mensa, but they survived and got to chat with a bunch of kids in the program.</p>
<p>After dinner that evening they also got to see our final Cabaret of the semester which was also amazing. It was a really heavy sensory show but a ton of us were involved and it was nice to end the performances of the semester on such a high note.</p>
<p>That was it for the first part of the week, but there will of course be more as their visit continues and the week goes on!  It&#8217;s been really strange around the villa this week though because the music students leave in just three days!!! It is crazy how fast this semester has gone by and I am torn between wanting to be home and see everyone and never ever ever wanting to leave this place.  SO MANY WIERD FEELINGS!!  All I can really do though is enjoy every second and make sure to take it all in for the remainder of my time here.</p>
<p>Until next time, Ciao!</p>

				<p>On Sunday the Men&#8217;s and Women&#8217;s basketball teams participated in a very special event with the Special Olympic athletes of the Lehigh Valley. This was the first of two clinics put on by Muhlenberg basketball this year for these athletes and the smiles were very telling of how the afternoon went!<a href="http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/11/2014-11-23-14.11.47.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-3561" src="http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/11/2014-11-23-14.11.47-1024x768.jpg" alt="Men and Women's basketball teams sitting in the middle of the gymnasium with the Special Olympic athletes" width="640" height="480" srcset="http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/11/2014-11-23-14.11.47-1024x768.jpg 1024w, http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/11/2014-11-23-14.11.47-300x225.jpg 300w, http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/11/2014-11-23-14.11.47.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a>As the athletes began to filter in we were able to introduce ourselves and shoot around with them individually while we waited for the clinic to begin. We separated to two parts of the gym based on age and comfort level, and started with layup lines, which induced plenty of cheering and you guessed it, more smiles.</p>
<p>After layup lines we played a game of knockout with the older athletes while some of the younger ones got shots in around the rest of the gym and played three on three on the main basket. I moved from drill to drill to participate (I got knocked out several times by a kid named Leo in the first drill).</p>
<p>With the older kids we moved on to play five on five that was a combination of the Muhlenberg athletes and the Special Olympic athletes. The talent of some of these athletes is unbelievable and it was so much fun to play with them and against them, and then to take a step back and see it all unfold from the crowd&#8217;s perspective.</p>
<p>We then got back together to thank the athletes for coming before playing one final game of five on five! It started with just the Muhlenberg teams, but soon every athlete wanted a chance to play and asked to sub in!</p>
<p>It was truly a special afternoon with plenty of memories to be cherished! <a href="http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/11/2014-11-23-14.29.41.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-3562 size-large" src="http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/11/2014-11-23-14.29.41-768x1024.jpg" alt="Three Muhlenberg athletes including Drew with a special olympic athletes." width="640" height="853" srcset="http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/11/2014-11-23-14.29.41-768x1024.jpg 768w, http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/11/2014-11-23-14.29.41-225x300.jpg 225w, http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/11/2014-11-23-14.29.41.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
