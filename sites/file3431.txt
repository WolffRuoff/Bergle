					<description><![CDATA[Much better, Group 3!  This is your best blog post thus far this semester.  You took an interesting article about the battle between the press and publicists and you utilized Turow&#039;s power roles framework in an interesting way.  You might even add here that motion picture distributors (e.g., the studios) spend a great deal of money on the advertising for their films, and online blogs and the press offer a much less expensive means to get the message out about a new film, albeit one with less control over what the message actually says (one wonders if even bad publicity is useful, in the P.T. Barnum sense).  So, the only thing I am left wondering is whether this spat between publicists and the press is even meaningful for the studios - do they win regardless, as long as their films is mentioned in the press or online?  Websites like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aintitcool.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Harry Knowles&#039; Ain&#039;t It Cool News&lt;/a&gt; are also increasingly important for the industry, yet the studios have little control over these third party websites, staffed primarily by fans and other agents who are interested in movies.  This could even be a promising direction for your group presentation.  Nice work here!]]></description>
