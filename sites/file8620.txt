								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is no doubt that sports play a pivotal role in American culture. From football to baseball to basketball to hockey to soccer to bowling to golf to tennis and even lacrosse, which has recently grown in popularity in the United States, sporting events are available for viewers to watch on a daily basis. Of course, this is nothing new. Sports have played a crucial role in the United States for decades. However, social media and the role it plays in connection to sports is relatively new. Popular social networking apps such as Facebook, Twitter, and Snapchat make an effort to keep their viewers updated with what is going on in the wide world of sports. While these social networking companies understand that sports have a tremendous cultural impact, they also understand that they have something to gain in making sports-related news so readily available. So, what exactly do these social networking companies have to gain by making sports news so accessible?</p>
<p>According to Dr. Jon Dart (2014, p. 529) of Leeds Metropolitan University, “the media has been a significant and constant companion in the development of professional sport with the latest stage of neoliberal capitalism adapting to, and exploiting, new media technologies to increase profits.” Economics is, largely, about consumer tastes. These tastes, in turn, contribute to consumer demand which tells major media corporations what to supply on their networks. Social networking companies have come to this realization. Hence, these companies monitor their members’ preferences. From here, these sites sell this information to media corporations. These corporations analyze the information and find out what the vast majority of consumers are interested in viewing. If consumers happen to be interested in viewing a Pittsburgh Steelers game, then most of the networks will air the Steelers game. It is no wonder that “new media technologies are not changing the nature of sport, but [are instead] making it more capitalist” (Dart, 2014, p. 530).</p>
<p>This capitalism has been “evident [since] the turn of the century when large media companies began to take ownership of sports teams, with Ted Turner’s 1976 purchase of the Atlanta Braves (MLB) being among the first” (Dart, 2014, p. 531). Other well-known media corporations such as Disney, Cablevision, and News Corporation have been or are still connected to professional sports. Disney founded the NHL’s Anaheim Ducks in 1993 and sold the franchise in 2005, Cablevision purchased the NBA’s New York Knicks and the NHL’s New York Rangers in 1997 and 1995, respectively, and News Corporation purchased the MLB’s Los Angeles Dodgers in 1998 and sold the team in 2004 (Dart, 2014, p. 531). The primary motive for these media companies in purchasing professional sports franchises is, as Dart (2014, p. 531) writes, for these companies to take control of “a greater level of any media related profit.” Often times, these media companies are able to reap the rewards of owning popular sports franchises. Yet, there are instances when these corporations recognize that there is greater benefit in “unload[ing] their sports assets” to “global super rich” clients (Dart, 2014, p. 531).</p>
<p>Moreover, a connection exists between professional sports, social media, and economics. The association between the three is one that has changed the “dynamic between sports fans, athletes, clubs, governing bodies, and mainstream media” (Dart, 2014, p. 528). This change has been positive in that it benefits social media companies, media corporations, and sports fans playing the role of everyday consumers. Social media companies gain by selling information about their members’ preferences to media corporations. Media corporations analyze this information and show highly-demanded games that will generate the greatest possible profit. As a result, sports fans get to enjoy games that they are thoroughly interested in viewing. Therefore, the bond between sports, social media, and economics has positively altered the relationship between sports fans, athletes, franchises, and media companies. This relationship is one in which everyone involved profits.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Snapchat has quickly become one of the leading social media sites that people use throughout their everyday lives. Although people of all ages use Snapchat, teenagers and others in their early twenties make up most of the user population. With this being the case, the NBA and NFL among other professional sports leagues have decided to bring their own featured content for the users of Snapchat to watch. On days when there is an important sporting event going on such as the MLB playoffs or NBA finals, Snapchat will let users that attend any of these events post real time videos from their phones to the events “My Story”. Snapchat users from all around the world can then watch these snaps in real time to witness the plays and sounds of each event. Snapchat is proving to be the place where teens and other users can get videos and photos that take them closer to sports. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The article that I read discussed why sports fans are using Snapchat for their sports content as opposed to other social media sites such as Facebook or Twitter. Based on my encounters with each of these apps, Snapchat is more easily navigable than any other social media site. While Facebook or Twitter might have one video of a touchdown or amazing play, Snapchat usually has well over 100 seconds of footage if the sporting event has a My Story. With one click of the button short clips of pre-game tailgates,national anthem, fans cheering in the stands, and plays from the game come across the screen without any clicking out or loading another video. With teenagers being labeled as impatient, Snapchat fits the mold perfectly as it is the most effective and quickest way to make yourself feel closer to the actual events of each sport. The article considers that unpredictability is a reason that fans use Snapchat as opposed to Twitter or Facebook. Sports can take a turn in a matter of seconds and one play can change the whole game. The author says that, “the ephemerality of the platform can be alluring. In contrast to Facebook, Twitter, or other social media platforms where a post can live forever, one can cheer when your team scores without worrying about looking dumb if they end up losing,” (Constine, 2014, p.1). On social media websites like Twitter or Facebook, users usually wait until after the event is over to post celebratory things about their teams win because they do not want to jinx or speak too soon. Snapchat is an app that lets people show events happening in real time so this problem does not occur. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With Snapchat being occupied by teenagers and people in their twenties, it will continue to be at the forefront of social media usage and maybe even surpass sites like Twitter and Facebook. Teenagers look to Snapchat and will continue to look to Snapchat to keep up to date with sporting events. With the success that Snapchat has had with leagues like the MLB, NBA, or NFL, it will be only a matter of time before others start showing their content to the users of Snapchat. </span></p>
