<p>(2011, 12 April) Sirius And XM Allowed To Merge In Canada. <em>FMQB</em>. Retrieved from <a href="http://www.fmqb.com/article.asp?id=2159191">http://www.fmqb.com/article.asp?id=2159191</a></p>
<p>The CRTC (Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission allowing Canadian Satellite Radio Inc. to merge with Sirius Canada Inc. and renewed each of their one-year licenses. CSR is the XM affiliate in Canada. The CRTC claimed that the merger would &#8220;offer clear benefits to the Canadian broadcasting system and to Canadian consumers.&#8221;</p>
<p>The new company will be named Canadian Satellite Radio Holdings, , and its largest shareholders will be John Bitove, the owner of CSRI Inc., US-based Sirius XM, CBC/Radio Canada, and Slaight Communications.</p>
<p><span id="more-1116"></span>The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission is one of Canada&#8217;s authority power roles. Without its approval, the Canadian counterparts to XM and Sirius would not be able to merge, despite facing financial difficulties. The merge could apparently save the companies a combined $20 million over 18 months and allow them to combine their strengths to attract more subscribers.</p>
<p>&#8220;This decision will lead to the creation of a stronger combined  organization, better equipped to innovate and compete in the broader  audio entertainment marketplace,&#8221; said Mark Redmond, President &amp; CEO  of both Sirius Canada and the merged entity.  &#8220;We are pleased that the  CRTC recognized the clear benefits derived from this merger.  This is an  exciting time for Sirius|XM Canada, and we look forward to continuing  to offer a world-class entertainment experience for our current and  future subscribers.&#8221;</p>
<p>The merger is also good news for the satellite radio companies because they will no longer have to compete with each other for contracts with linking-pin companies&#8211;namely automotive companies. This merger may sound good to potential or current subscribers because it seems like the combined company will be able to offer more over a broader range of content. It may be true, however there is also the possibility of viewing this as a continuing trend of consolidation in the radio industry.</p>
<p>Just as the provisions in the Telecommunications Act of 1996 abolished limits on how many radio stations one company may own was followed by terrestrial radio consolidation, the two major satellite radio providers are now owned by only one company. On the other hand, this may give satellite radio a fighting chance at remaining an up-and-coming radio platform that has not yet realized its full, impressive potential.</p>
<p>Canada’s antitrust watchdog is the Competition Bureau. The CB approved the merger  in February, but certain  closing conditions remain. The merger is scheduled to close by June 2011.</p>

CEO Mel Karmazin predicts that improving auto sales, declining capital expenditure, and the up-coming release of Sirius XM 2.0 to improve functionality will also add to the company&#8217;s success on into the future. Competition for Sirius XM, however, may be growing stronger.</p>
<p>Pandora Radio will be available as part of the new Chevy MyLink in-vehicle entertainment system, allowing listeners to synch their smartphones containing their existing Pandora accounts to the system.</p>
<p><span id="more-860"></span></p>
<p>In addition, GM will be incorporating voice and song recognition software so that the driver can for the first time control their listening through a device other than their smartphone device. According to Pandora SVP Jessica Steel, over half of radio listening takes place in the car. Now with Pandora as accessible in the car as Sirius XM or terrestrial radio, not to mention portable and in-dash music players, they stand to benefit from this large in-vehicle listening market and compete with Sirius XM directly.</p>
<p>Pandora recently detailed plans to go public, which Sirius XM said was ultimately non-threatening; however, if Pandora, which as of 2009 had 40 million users, can gather significant financial investors, then it is possible that they could integrate into the same market areas and capture a significant portion of Sirius XM&#8217;s target audience. Pandora and Sirius XM are different in that listeners must pay for a subscription to Sirius XM, which is a satellite radio. Pandora is free, on the other hand, but its profits depend on advertisements directed towards highly specified and coveted audiences. Pandora is based on the Internet. Since Pandora is free, is targets a younger audience, from around 17-15 who d not necessarily have the finances to support serious XM subscriptions; this could have long term effects if Pandora becomes successful in gaining brand loyalty. Additionally, younger audiences prove to be more tech-savvy and opt to use their smartphone devices for more and more services.</p>
<p>However, they both ultimately offer a more personalized listening experience in increasingly overlapping environments, which gives Pandora something of a competitive advantage in this regard. Pandora allows one to skip songs and build personalized music stations, while Sirius XM offers only present channels which are differentiated by genre and station-selected playlists. Listeners may come to decide that they would rather be free to customize their own listening on Pandora at the expense of listening to advertisements. This of course would negatively affect the number of subscriptions to Sirius XM which, again, depends on subscriptions for their revenue.</p>
