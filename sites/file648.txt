This program invites inner city elementary and middle school kids to visit a college and glimpse college life. What do colleges look like? What happens there? Could I be a college student one day?<\/p>\n<p>College Connect this year brought five school groups, roughly 200 students, to campus at different points during the academic year, for a day. Most of the students came from Roosevelt Elementary and Cleveland Elementary Schools.<\/p>\n<p>The library portion of the day is a favorite for the kids, because it includes a library scavenger hunt with prizes for all. Kids are asked to go to the library&#8217;s online catalog and type in the name of their favorite animal. Then they are to write down a call number of their favorite animal and retrieve the book from the stacks. They win a bookmark and a pencil. It&#8217;s simple, the kids love it, and it gets them into a library with hands-on experience with books.<\/p>\n<p>Also included in the library portion of the day is a short critique of a\u00a0<strong><a href=\"http:\/\/zapatopi.net\/treeoctopus\/\">website<\/a><\/strong>\u00a0about the Pacific Northwest Tree Octopus. Students are asked if they think the information presented there is correct. Can you guess what 3rd graders might say?<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>Google Books Links to Trexler Library<\/strong><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Searching for a book just got much easier. Let&#8217;s imagine that you need a book that discusses a particular poem by Emily Dickinson. Or one that addresses the demography of a specific town in Pennsylvania. You&#8217;ve had no luck because the search engines you&#8217;ve been using only look at the subject and the title of the book, and none mention your topic. Enter\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/books.google.com\/\">Google Books<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Google Books allows searching of entire contents of a book, even if copyright prevents the entire books from being seen. Lack of online access is no matter really, because Google Books now links to interlibrary loan and Muhlenberg College&#8217;s library, when you are on campus.<\/p>\n<p>Once you locate a title in Google Books that looks interesting, simply click on &#8220;Find in a Library&#8221; then &#8220;Search Trexler Library for this title.&#8221; If not at Trexler, click on &#8220;Request Item&#8221; and and fill out the interlibrary loan request form. It&#8217;s that easy!<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>NITLE Webinar<\/strong><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Upcoming NITLE webinar, free to Muhlenberg employees:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Title: Developing Digital Humanities Projects<br \/>\nDate: Thursday, May 2, 3-4 pm EDT<br \/>\nLocation: Hosted online via NITLE&#8217;s videoconferencing platform<br \/>\nDetails:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.nitle.org\/live\/events\/174-developing-digital-humanities-projects\">http:\/\/www.nitle.org\/live\/events\/174-developing-digital-humanities-projects<\/a><\/p>\n<p>The authors of\u00a0<strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.devdh.org\/\"><span style=\"font-family: Tahoma\">DevDH.org<\/span><\/a><\/strong>\u00a0will introduce participants to best practices for designing and organizing their first digital humanities project, including how to frame a project appropriately, identify and set attainable goals, build project teams, and find potential tools and resources.
