Nearly the entire reference and periodicals collections are being integrated into a single main collection (AV and government documents remain separate) beginning on A level and moving through C level. The purpose of this is to enhance discovery: all materials of like subject matter will reside together, regardless of format. The integration follows the model of many other institutions of higher learning that have so combined their collections.<\/p>\n<p>We are in the middle of the move. Please let the library staff know if you have any questions or concerns. And thank you for your patience!<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>Infomaniac Tip<\/strong><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Looking for a novel approach to sports reporting?<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/bleacherreport.com\/\">Bleacher Report<\/a>\u00a0has been called a &#8220;sports-themed variant of the Huffington Post.&#8221; It is citizen journalism at its best, allowing thousands of fan-contributors to have their say, resulting in, as one web critic describes it, a pleasing &#8220;penchant for wacky lists and sideshows.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Reaching 20 Million unique readers each month, Bleacher Report is one of the largest destinations on the web, and one of the five largest properties in the sports category. The site launched in 2008 as a centralized platform for writers to contribute original articles about their favorite sports teams and topics. The company&#8217;s wide scale allows it to cover hundreds of teams, athletes, and events each day &#8211; far surpassing the capabilities of traditional publishers Furthermore, Bleacher Report has also separated itself by embracing a unique voice that combines real-time coverage of breaking news with an entertaining perspective.<\/p>\n<p>URL:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/bleacherreport.com\/\">http:\/\/bleacherreport.com\/<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>Calendar<\/strong><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>9\/22<\/strong>\u00a0&#8211; Faculty Author Reception: Phil Secor, former Dean the College and Political Science faculty member, has recently completed an updated history of Muhlenberg College.
