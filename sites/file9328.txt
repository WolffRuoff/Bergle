					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;It has been pointed out that Alex Price was actually correct in stating that Westborough is 45 minutes up from Gillette stadium, so we have upgraded our rating of Price&#039;s responses from pants on fire to false. We are sorry for the confusion.&lt;/p&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;We give Alex Price a pants on fire rating for his responses. First, he completely dodged the question on the intensity of his feelings for the Patriots, as a rating of 12 on a scale of 1-10 is nonsensical. Furthermore, PolitiFact has found sources attesting that Price&#039;s unwashed jersey does not, in fact, smell like victory. It smells like a jersey that hasn&#039;t been washed in three months. Finally, Gillette Stadium is actually about 45 minutes down I-495 from Westborough, not up as Price stated. This is due to the fact that Westborough lies to the north of Foxboro, so Price would have to travel down I-495 south, not I-495 north.&lt;/p&gt;
