An open model, meanwhie, could take full advantage of the collaborative environment of the Web. Open science proponents contend that an open model would be self-screening: only those qualified would enter the discussion because the topics and vocabulary by their very nature assume a certain level of interest and expertise.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some examples of open science already in place:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/\">arXiv<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.plos.org\/\">Public Library of Science<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.galaxyzoo.org\/\">GalaxyZoo<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/home.Home.html\">ResearchGate<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>On the other hand, traditional journal publishers argue that &#8220;open science&#8221; sounds good in theory, but that in fact it fails to provide what many academics are looking for from academic publication: a means to tenure and promotion. For open science to succeed, it needs to come up with a new way to assess value and offer incentives, whether monetary or by advancing one&#8217;s reputation. Traditional publishers contend that the peer review process alone is expensive, not to mention other publishing costs. Who will cover these costs?<\/p>\n<p>Regardless of the points of disagreement, nearly everyone agrees on one thing: change is coming. But when, how, and how much remain to be seen.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>New Books Added to the Library Collection in Fall 2011<\/strong><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The library collection has seen considerable growth over the last few months, thanks to faculty and staff working together.
