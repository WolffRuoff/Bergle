								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The internet has become a huge part of our lives. We don&#8217;t realize how huge until we take a look at the facts. For example, &#8220;Google receives 5.93 billion searches every day&#8221; (Keshen 1). Being a student I use google very often to look up unfamiliar words or for research on a topic. People use technology heavily not only in their professional lives but also in their personal lives and sometimes it carries over from one to another. For example, my Uncle Scott is a businessman and uses email constantly to talk to other people in the company or people from other companies. But, he also uses that same email to communicate with our family. He never texts me, it is strictly email and with us having different technology habits it can sometimes take me a while to respond to him. Besides basic, small scaled communication like email, there is also more widespread communication like Twitter and Facebook. OnÂ  these social media sites one can make statuses/updates to reach all the people that follow them at once. Or they can use instant messaging through the social medias to have it be direct and private like email. Twitter and Facebook are not typically used for professional reasons unless there is a page for some sort of company to keep their customers updated.</p>
<p>The internet has made several things much simpler. Instead of going to the mall to shop, one can just pull up the store online and look through all the inventory in the comfort of their own home. According to this infographic, &#8220;Americans spend an average of $717,808,219 every day on online purchases&#8221; (Keshen 3). From my experience, Cyber Monday has actually become more popular than Black Friday. Black Friday seems to be more popular among the older generations rather than the younger ones, probably because the younger ones are more into technology.</p>
