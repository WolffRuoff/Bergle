								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The rise of the Internet over the past twenty or so years has undoubtedly changed the way of life for many. From instant access to extensive amounts of information to being able to communicate with individuals on the other side of the world in a flash, the Internet has unquestionably made previously unimaginable tasks possible. This feat has, largely, been achieved through the development of social networking sites such as Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn. These sites certainly make connecting and communicating with people simple. Hence, Shannon Belew (2014, p. 1) explains in her book, <em>Art of Social Selling: Finding and Engaging Customers on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and Other Social Networks</em>, that there are over one billion people active on top social networks. “These networks include LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, and Google+” (Belew, 2014, p. 1). However, the positive effects of these social networking sites extend far beyond friendly communication. How else, then, are these social networks used?</p>
<p>One of the largest uses for social networking sites is commerce. It is no surprise that businesses are focusing their efforts toward social networks given the number of members these networks possess. Belew (2014, p. 1) notes that if businesses “are able to connect with even one-tenth of one percent of [these members], then [businesses] have reached more than one million people.” While being active on social networking sites does not guarantee businesses a million or hundreds of thousands of leads, it does provide them with the potential to reach “a high number of high-quality prospects” (Belew, 2014, p. 2). Commerce is home to a survival of the fittest mentality in which only the strongest businesses survive and outlive their competitors. Belew (2014, p. 2) states that effective businesses will be able to adapt to changes in the sales and marketing process that social media is responsible for. As a result, these businesses will be able to effectively monitor social media sites, see what potential customers want, and fulfill these demands. In doing so, the businesses that utilize social media will leave their competitors not using social media, and their sales quota, “in the dust” (Belew, 2014, p. 2).</p>
<p>Businesses are not the only winner when commerce takes place on social networking sites. Consumers can benefit as well. Belew (2014, p. 3) provides a prime example of a consumer that wins from commerce taking place over social networks in her story of a customer that had booked a reservation at a relatively well-known hotel in California. The hotel made an error in booking the woman’s reservation and it appeared as if she did not have a place to stay. The customer decided to take her frustrations to Twitter, where a competing hotel noticed her tweet. The hotel responded to the customer, suggesting that she stay at their hotel next time she was in the area. The hotel stated that they would be happy to take care of her and make her stay as relaxing and stress-free as possible. Of course, the hotel made sure that this tweet was public and in turn saw a “nice bump in reservations” (Belew, 2014, p. 3). Yet, the hotel was not the only winner in this scenario. The woman, or consumer in this case, and several other consumers, for that matter, benefited. The woman and other individuals knew that they could travel and have a hotel to stay in that would meet their expectations.</p>
<p>Moreover, a powerful bond exists between social media and commerce. Businesses know that by adapting to the new social media driven sales and marketing process they will be able to closely-observe social media sites, see what potential customers desire, and meet the demand for these wants so that a profit can be made. Consumers are still paying the same amount that they typically would for products, but they can rest assured that the money they are spending is going toward goods and services that will, more often than not, meet their expectations. Thus, the relationship between commerce and social media is not so bad after all. Rather, this connection is a positive one that yields the satisfaction of businesses and consumers alike.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is no doubt that sports play a pivotal role in American culture. From football to baseball to basketball to hockey to soccer to bowling to golf to tennis and even lacrosse, which has recently grown in popularity in the United States, sporting events are available for viewers to watch on a daily basis. Of course, this is nothing new. Sports have played a crucial role in the United States for decades. However, social media and the role it plays in connection to sports is relatively new. Popular social networking apps such as Facebook, Twitter, and Snapchat make an effort to keep their viewers updated with what is going on in the wide world of sports. While these social networking companies understand that sports have a tremendous cultural impact, they also understand that they have something to gain in making sports-related news so readily available. So, what exactly do these social networking companies have to gain by making sports news so accessible?</p>
<p>According to Dr. Jon Dart (2014, p. 529) of Leeds Metropolitan University, “the media has been a significant and constant companion in the development of professional sport with the latest stage of neoliberal capitalism adapting to, and exploiting, new media technologies to increase profits.” Economics is, largely, about consumer tastes. These tastes, in turn, contribute to consumer demand which tells major media corporations what to supply on their networks. Social networking companies have come to this realization. Hence, these companies monitor their members’ preferences. From here, these sites sell this information to media corporations. These corporations analyze the information and find out what the vast majority of consumers are interested in viewing. If consumers happen to be interested in viewing a Pittsburgh Steelers game, then most of the networks will air the Steelers game. It is no wonder that “new media technologies are not changing the nature of sport, but [are instead] making it more capitalist” (Dart, 2014, p. 530).</p>
<p>This capitalism has been “evident [since] the turn of the century when large media companies began to take ownership of sports teams, with Ted Turner’s 1976 purchase of the Atlanta Braves (MLB) being among the first” (Dart, 2014, p. 531). Other well-known media corporations such as Disney, Cablevision, and News Corporation have been or are still connected to professional sports. Disney founded the NHL’s Anaheim Ducks in 1993 and sold the franchise in 2005, Cablevision purchased the NBA’s New York Knicks and the NHL’s New York Rangers in 1997 and 1995, respectively, and News Corporation purchased the MLB’s Los Angeles Dodgers in 1998 and sold the team in 2004 (Dart, 2014, p. 531). The primary motive for these media companies in purchasing professional sports franchises is, as Dart (2014, p. 531) writes, for these companies to take control of “a greater level of any media related profit.” Often times, these media companies are able to reap the rewards of owning popular sports franchises. Yet, there are instances when these corporations recognize that there is greater benefit in “unload[ing] their sports assets” to “global super rich” clients (Dart, 2014, p. 531).</p>
<p>Moreover, a connection exists between professional sports, social media, and economics. The association between the three is one that has changed the “dynamic between sports fans, athletes, clubs, governing bodies, and mainstream media” (Dart, 2014, p. 528). This change has been positive in that it benefits social media companies, media corporations, and sports fans playing the role of everyday consumers. Social media companies gain by selling information about their members’ preferences to media corporations. Media corporations analyze this information and show highly-demanded games that will generate the greatest possible profit. As a result, sports fans get to enjoy games that they are thoroughly interested in viewing. Therefore, the bond between sports, social media, and economics has positively altered the relationship between sports fans, athletes, franchises, and media companies. This relationship is one in which everyone involved profits.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The advent of the computer has undoubtedly led to the emergence of three major operating systems. Aforementioned operating systems include Windows, Mac, and Linux. According to StatCounter (Wikipedia, 2015), Windows is the most widely used operating system by families worldwide. Windows is unique in that it contains Microsoft Office, “an office suite of applications, servers and services” (Wikipedia, 2015). Microsoft Office’s applications include the well-known Word, PowerPoint, and Excel programs as well as the Access, Outlook, OneNote, Publisher, and Project programs (Wikipedia, 2015). These programs provide students and professionals with a multitude of features that can be utilized to complete tasks in a timely and efficient matter. But, what are the specific features of these programs that make them so vital to academic and professional success? To answer this question, a further analysis of the three programs that Microsoft included in its original 1988 Office bundle—Word, PowerPoint, and Excel—must be conducted (Wikipedia, 2015).</p>
<p>Since its release in 1983, Microsoft Word has often been “considered the main program in [Microsoft] Office” (Wikipedia, 2015). Word is “a word processor” that was originally developed “for the MS-DOS operating system and had the distinction of introducing the mouse to a broad population” (Wikipedia, 2015). Though a mouse was not required for the program to operate, “Word 1.0 could be purchased with a bundled mouse” by those that desired one (Wikipedia, 2015). Word has played such an integral part in Office due to its sustained popularity. This popularity is due, largely in part, to its ever-expanding role in the lives of students and professionals. Students and professionals make daily use of Word when looking to complete tasks such as essays, letters, and reports.  Word’s user-friendly display offers a plethora of options for individuals to design, format, and review projects that they are working on. With Word, a user has the opportunity to pick from stunning fonts such as Broadway and Georgia, elect the margin size for a paper, and review the paper using the popular feature Word Count. Hence, Word’s seemingly endless possibilities make it a go-to for students and professionals looking to produce exceptional projects.</p>
<p>Another favorite among students and professionals is Office’s PowerPoint program. PowerPoint is a “presentation program” that enables users to “create slideshows, composed of text, graphics, and other objects, which can be displayed on-screen and shown by the presenter or printed out on transparencies or slides” (Wikipedia, 2015).  Visual presentations are crucial. Said presentations allow audiences to fully grasp the concept that the presenter is exhibiting during a presentation. Visual presentations are made simple by PowerPoint which lets users choose from many of the same gorgeous fonts on Word, set the presentation’s background to their choosing, and implement transitions. It is no wonder why so many people turn to PowerPoint. Whether its students giving a class presentation, educators teaching a new topic to their students, or business executives introducing a product to their clients, people rely on PowerPoint as a resource to convey the message(s) they are attempting to get across.</p>
<p>The final member of Microsoft’s “big three” from its original 1988 Office bundle is Microsoft Excel. “Microsoft Excel is a spreadsheet program” that was introduced for Windows on a “run-time environment in November [of] 1987” (Wikipedia, 2015). Like its close friends Word and PowerPoint, Excel is an ideal program for students and professionals. Excel is the perfect tool for projects that involve numbers. Excel provides users with cells, organized by column letter and row number. These cells will take the values a user opts to input into the program and then apply the values to a user-selected formula from Excel’s extensive formula list. Therefore, Excel is the perfect program for individuals looking to run a series of calculations. Students taking advanced business, mathematics, or science courses and people that work in analytics and other related fields praise Excel for its incredible features.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Microsoft Office is the perfect tool for students and professionals. Office’s trifecta of Word, PowerPoint, and Excel in addition to its Access, Outlook, Publisher, OneNote and Project programs provide individuals with an array of features that can be utilized to complete tasks effectively. Since its release in 1988, Microsoft Office has built a reputation for itself as a consistently reliable set of applications. As a result, people turn to Office and will continue to do so as they look to produce high-caliber projects.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The development of mobile phones, specifically smartphones, has brought about the creation of numerous apps. Among some of today’s most widely used apps are group messaging apps. In particular, GroupMe, owned by Microsoft, has emerged as one of the most popular group messaging apps on the market. In fact, there are some who swear by GroupMe, claiming that it is the best mobile messaging app available. So, why are so many individuals of this mindset?</p>
<p>There are several reasons users prefer GroupMe to other mobile messaging apps. Among them are that GroupMe enables individuals to “select who is in the group and make it private,” provides members with an opportunity to “upload photos or videos like multimedia text messages,” and makes sure that a user’s “phone number remains private to the group” he/she is in (Ledesma, 2012, p.3). While author Paul Ledesma (2012, p.3) notes that GroupMe is primarily geared toward smartphones, he writes that its chats can also be accessed as SMS text messages. Additionally, GroupMe is extremely accommodating in that it allows users to simply request to increase the number of members in a group should it exceed the standard size of 25, works on every smartphone, and can be accessed via computers (Ledesma, 2012, p.3).</p>
<p>GroupMe is such a user-friendly app that Ledesma, the Director of Undergraduate Admission at the University of Southern California’s Viterbi School of Engineering, has decided to use it for several of his affairs. Prior to using GroupMe, Ledesma would prepare logistics sheets to work out details regarding locations, people, and duties for several events that were taking place on campus (Ledesma, 2012, p.2). The primary issue with these logistics sheets was that Ledesma often found that he and his crew would have to change “one last detail at the last minute” typically having to cancel or add a location (Ledesma, 2012, p. 2). In addition, Ledesma’s crew was heavily reliant on rented walkie talkies. Unfortunately, not everyone would receive a walkie talkie due to expenses and those who did receive them often needed to resort to call signs and CB talk “over and outs” (Ledesma, 2012, p.3). Thus, GroupMe provided the perfect solution.</p>
<p>With GroupMe Ledesma has been able to effectively communicate with his 25 student ambassadors, the professional admission staff, and the front desk staff (Ledesma, 2012, p. 3). The app is beneficial for both students and staff. The staff is not keen on giving out their phone numbers to all of the students and can avoid doing so by using GroupMe and students can disable their notifications if they are in class (Ledesma, 2012, p. 3).  The icing on the cake is that the inclusion of the front desk staff in the chat has given receptionists an opportunity to take calls on the phone and communicate with students and staff on the computer simultaneously (Ledesma, 2012, p. 4).</p>
<p>Furthermore, GroupMe has made mass communication significantly simpler. Ledesma’s case serves as a prime example and is certainly not an anomaly. GroupMe has gained notoriety with students, specifically those in high school and college. Students have found that GroupMe’s user-friendly interface has made it easy to create multiple chats. For instance, any given person may be in nine or ten chats. Four of these chats may be dedicated to friends, another three to classes, and the final three to family. Aforementioned chats are bundled into one app providing GroupMe users with immediate access to conversations between classmates, family, and friends. As a result, communication in today’s day in age could not be easier than it is with GroupMe.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Reading, often viewed as a dreadful act by students, is much more than just a means of getting individuals to remember the information being presented. As Mike Hanski writes in a piece for the <em>Huffington Post</em>, reading plays a pivotal role in molding the type of writer a person becomes. According to Hanski (2014, p. 1), writing is not a skill that can simply be attained by the memorization of grammatical rules, punctuation marks, and various writing styles. Rather, one becomes a phenomenal writer by reading. Studies have shown that reading produces a source of inspiration for many, leads to increased knowledge, prepares children for school, enables writers to understand their readers, and does much more. Additionally, reading “makes our lives easier” in the long run (Hanski, 2014, p. 3). Hanski (2014, p.3) notes that reading is responsible for broadening our minds, opening our hearts to new things, and teaching us to respect others.</p>
<p>In the grand scheme of things, reading is not so bad. The path to communicating with others effectively starts with reading “as it connects [people] to the rest of the whole world” (Hanski, 2014, p. 2). Communication can be considered more crucial in today’s society than it has ever been before. With so many different communication platforms around, one is constantly expected to be able to convey his/her thoughts. However, several means of modern communication would not be possible without writing. Take email and social media sites such as Twitter and Facebook as prime examples. As people communicate via email, Twitter, and Facebook, they write down their thoughts electronically. While much of what is posted to Twitter and Facebook is written informally by misinformed people, there are instances when individuals make valid points. These points are typically well-thought-out and well-written. This type of writing, as Hanski (2014, p.1) points out, would not be possible without people first making the effort to read about their topic of discussion.</p>
<p>If everyone decided that reading was futile, people would constantly be uninformed about prevalent issues. Moreover, communication between friends, family, high-level business executives, teachers, students, and even the president of the United States and the general public could not exist, as it does today, without individuals first taking the time to read. Just as Hanski (2014, p. 2) writes, one should take the time to read something that he/she enjoys. A person will ultimately find that he/she is not only better equipped to discuss what has been read, but to write about it as well.</p>
