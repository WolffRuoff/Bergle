<p>The future of television viewing is here and the battle of cable providers versus networks is on.  Time Warner Cable recently developed an app for the iPad that delivers 17 live TV channels to iPad users via a cable modem.  Another cable distributor, Cablevision, is also developing an app that will deliver live TV to the iPad.  Finally, Dish Network provides a live feed to personal media devices, including the Ipad, through its Sling box service.  Why this shift in cable distribution?  Cable companies are adjusting to the reality that TV is not just watched on television sets anymore: the traditional TV competes with other technologies such as computers and phones. These companies want to distribute TV to all of these technologies rather than watching the television networks sell their rights to competing distributors or directly to the consumers.<span id="more-1070"></span></p>
<p>However, owners of cable networks, including Viacom, Scripps, and Discovery, claim that this type of television distribution requires additional rights to content, and Time Warner Cable, Cablevision and others will have to negotiate for these rights.   Scripps Network went public with its resistance saying it “has not granted iPad streaming rights to any distributor and is actively addressing any misunderstandings on this issue.” The networks’ central argument is that the rights should be sold for an additional premium. They also argue that the content is being delivered through a wireless broadband network and, while ads are shown in the stream, Nielsen isn’t yet able to measure them, which in turn means the networks can’t make money through advertising. Furthermore, networks have appealed to the authority power role, arguing that if the iPad is just another TV, then it should abide by the FCC laws, which would require them to carry broadcast channels required by the regulators.</p>
<p>This is an example of how a new technology can create tension between producer and distributor.   The distributor, the cable companies, doesn’t want to be left behind, so it has little choice but to change its business practices to include newly emerging technologies like the iPad.  However, the networks want to make sure that they get maximum money for their content, so they can hardly allow cable companies to stream TV shows to the iPad without forcing the companies to pay for this right.  The cable distributors are wise to be adaptive to technological changes and to take advantage of their access to TV viewers, one of their most valuable resources. But, just as we saw with Hulu, the networks control television content and, thus, have some power over distributors.</p>
<p>It is a very interesting time for the television industry since the traditional way of watching television programs is changing. Viewers have more options than ever, including Hulu and YouTube, as well as using other technologies like the iPad.   As the consumption of television through alternative screens become more popular, we are also likely to see more structural regulation from the FCC as TV producers and distributors make changes to adjust to the changing face of television.  The authority power role is very important in determining how media can be made and presented, and crucially, how the money gets distributed. As the new technology develops, the regulations will soon to follow. It is interesting and exciting that we get to see what happens next!</p>
