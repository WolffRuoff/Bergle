One of his key messages was that we in higher education have a friend in fair use. Fair use, a tiny exception in the U.S. copyright code, allows educators to utilize copyrighted works without seeking permission, so long as the use is based (in good faith) on these 4 criteria:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;<\/li>\n<li>the nature of the copyrighted work;<\/li>\n<li>the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and<\/li>\n<li>the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Kevin conceded that the criteria are vague. That is the beauty and the curse of this flexible exception to the law.<\/p>\n<p>For more information about fair use criteria or copyright generally, consult the\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.muhlenberg.edu\/library\/reshelp\/copyright.html\">Muhlenberg College Copyright Policy and Primer<\/a>, or call x3602.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>Infomaniac Tip<\/strong><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><em><strong>Touring History<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>Historic Italy, UNESCO World Heritage, and More<\/em><br \/>\nGoogle Maps Street View &#8220;lets you explore places around the world through 360-degree street-level imagery.&#8221; Visit notable historical sites, such as the Colosseum and the Appian Way.
