<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://cdn.pocket-lint.com/images/zYQm/amazon-cloud-drive-streams-in-1.jpg?20110329-123718" alt="" width="221" height="137" />The last decade has witnessed fierce competition between media companies whose products were initially quite different. <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a>, that little search engine that could in the nineties, today locks horns with <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> in the Internet TV and music exhibition market. Now <a href="http://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a>, that erstwhile book distributor, has announced that it, too, is joining the digital music fray. In a move that will <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/apr/03/john-naughton-amazon-cloud-drive-google-sony">light a fire under product developers</a> at Apple and Google, Amazon announced the debut of its new digital music service <a href="https://www.amazon.com/clouddrive/learnmore/ref=sa_menu_acd_lrn2">Cloud Drive</a>, which allows users to share their own music across computers through the Internet (the “cloud”). And, true to form, the recording companies are already finding reasons to go berserk about it.</p>
<p><span id="more-1024"></span></p>
<p>Amazon, of course, has been both exhibiting and distributing music for years. The new service will make Amazon a facilitator, as well. Users will be able to create an Amazon account, upload existing music files or buy MP3s right from Amazon, and access that music on any Internet-capable computer. By facilitating users’ storage of existing MP3s, Amazon obviously hopes to draw more users into its own MP3 store in an imitation of Apple’s<a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/"> iTunes</a> success. The company even offers discounts on storage space based on the number of MP3s the user buys directly from Amazon. And why shouldn’t they buy? One digital copy of a song is about the same as any other, and Amazon’s MP3s can live on the Internet instead of just one computer. All the people who lost their entire iTunes library when attempting to transfer it from one computer to another should take note.</p>
<p>It looks like Amazon may actually make some money off of this. And wherever you find an outside company profiting from a music service, you find the <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-31001_3-20048499-261.html">major record labels preparing to sue them</a>. The exact details of the labels’ problem with the service are a bit sketchy, but the main concern is a new form of P2P file sharing. Cloud Drive technically only allows users to share music with themselves on different digital platforms, but if one user uploads thousands of songs and then starts selling their Cloud Drive password for $50 a pop, a nightmare could ensue for the recording industry.</p>
<p>The record labels, possibly weary of dragging all of the world’s 7 billion people through the U.S. legal system, have indicated that they’re willing to drop the issue if Amazon re-buys the licenses for the songs they distribute through Cloud Drive, thereby reducing the financial impact of possible mass file sharing. So far, Amazon has adamantly refused. They claim that they are simply providing users with an online external hard drive. The recording companies have pointed out that it’s much easier to share music online than through a physical hard drive, but Amazon argues that the two are legally the same.</p>
<p>In addition to the labels’ lust for making users pay every time two notes of a song hit their ears, Amazon must also find ways to compete with Google and Apple, who are already calling Cloud Drive an inferior product. Google’s upcoming digital music service has hit legal challenges from the labels before it even debuted, but Google claims it’s working through the challenges while developing features for users that will easily out-compete Cloud Drive, including easy ways to store video and photos as well as music. Amazon, for its part, is basking in the glow of both upstaging the record labels and being the first in the new market.</p>
<p>Only time will tell whether all digital content—music, video, etc.—will migrate to the cloud during the next few years, but with almost all the major technology companies developing cloud-driven products, it certainly seems likely. The recording companies may need to be dragged, kicking and screaming, into this future. Now that other companies are finding ways to let users expand their digital music options, the labels will have to continue finding ways to continue profiting from their products. That is the industry’s current challenge.</p>

(22 February 2011). Interscope&#8217;s Jimmy Iovine fighting the 24-bit fight. <em>Billboard</em>. Retrieved from <a href="http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/industry/digital-and-mobile/interscope-s-jimmy-iovine-fighting-the-24-1005044072.story#">http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/industry/digital-and-mobile/interscope-s-jimmy-iovine-fighting-the-24-1005044072.story#</a></p>
<p>Forget CDs! The real format war in the recording industry is between 16-bit and 24-bit audio files, and some industry executives are taking the 24-bit side. Interscope CEO Jimmy Iovine and Columbia Records Co-President Rick Rubin are pressuring other labels to start releasing audio files to iTunes in the higher-quality 24-bit format, ostensibly in an effort to improve the user’s experience. Unfortunately for users, the price of the new format may increase along with the quality.</p>
<p><span id="more-921"></span></p>
<p>But which users will buy these new 24-bit files? In a world where CDs still form the bulk of the industry’s profits, it seems silly for industry executives to promote an upgrade from an iTunes file format that nobody’s complaining about. However, it’s not the first format upgrade the industry’s initiated. In fact, the industry aggressively promoted CDs back in the late eighties and ended up with a years-long boom in profits as everyone switched to the new format. Maybe industry executives are hoping to mirror their success with CDs by promoting another “higher-quality” format for which they can charge more.</p>
<p>The future of this plan, however, hinges on Iovine and Rubin’s success in recruiting other industry executives to their side. As producers, both executives worry about their companies’ future profitability, and history shows that every media company promoting its own personal format isn’t conducive to higher profits for anyone. Both surely remember the <a href="http://www.mediacollege.com/video/format/compare/betamax-vhs.html">disastrous VHS-Beta war of the eighties</a>. The industry’s continued existence may rely on multiple producers banding together under one format.</p>
<p>It’s also possible that, after alienating the bulk of their digital fan base with <a href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2008/09/proving-file-sh/">frivolous file-sharing lawsuits</a>, record industry executives like Iovine and Rubin are eager to prove that they’re still on the users’ side. What better way to do this than to don the public advocate hat and pretend that what’s good for the record industry is what’s good for America? After all, the higher-quality music may enrich users’ overall experience—and would probably sound <em>great</em> under some of Iovine’s <a href="http://www.beatsbydre.com/">“Beats by Dre” line headphones</a>!</p>
<p>The real linchpin in this scheme is, of course, <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/">Apple</a>. Industry executives can release music in any format they want, but Apple’s software and devices need to play them. As music distribution and exhibition responsibilities pass from “one-stops” to iTunes, Apple’s cooperation becomes a crucial component of any business strategy in the music industry. Iovine is working with Apple and says they’ve been “great,” which must be the new euphemism for “greedy.” Everyone who understands Apple knows they won’t agree to reconfigure their software and devices to run a new, higher-priced format without reconfiguring the way they manage profits from sales of that new, higher-priced music. Financial details are sketchy, but with industry executives and Apple executives (is there a difference anymore?) on either end of the bargaining table, the negotiations should be intense.</p>
<p>The real issue, however, revolves around whether music fans care more about quality of music or convenience of access. Another executive at Sony pointed out that users historically care more about convenience. And as every Internet user knows, accessing music online has never been more convenient. If a new 24-bit format became standard right now, it’s likely that the only major change would be more 24-bit files on <a href="http://thepiratebay.org/">Pirate Bay</a>.</p>
<p>Maybe industry executives should focus on getting people to pay for the existing 16-bit format before promoting new digital formats.</p>
