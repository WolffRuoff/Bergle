								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hampp, A.  (March 7, 2011).  <em>Advertising Age</em>.  Retrieved from   <a href="http://0-web.ebscohost.com.library.muhlenberg.edu/ehost/detail?sid=c446cf18-a0d0-4f89-93e7-2c37fc392229%40sessionmgr14&amp;vid=1&amp;hid=11&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZSZzY29wZT1zaXRl#db=ufh&amp;AN=59228441">http://0-web.ebscohost.com.library.muhlenberg.edu/ehost/detail?sid=c446cf18-a0d0-4f89-93e7-2c37fc392229%40sessionmgr14&amp;vid=1&amp;hid=11&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZSZzY29wZT1zaXRl#db=ufh&amp;AN=59228441</a>.</p>
<p>Remember getting up early on Saturda<img class="alignleft" src="http://www.flowersbyvalerie.com/images/FBVED007.jpg" alt="" width="144" height="122" />y mornings to watch cartoons?  You undoubtedly remember such classics as <em>Recess </em>and <em>Pepper Ann</em>, but you probably also remember those bright, flashy advertisements for products like Gushers, Dunkaroos, and Kraft Mac and Cheese.  However, there have been some changes regarding food and drink advertising aimed towards kids.  After years of scrutiny from the FCC, 17 advertisers, including Burger King and Kraft, have not only improved the health content of their products, but have also changed their marketing strategies.  This agreement is called the Children’s Food and Beverage Advertising Initiative and is a creation of the Council of Better Business Bureaus.  In 2007, these advertisers pledged to promote healthy products in at least half of their media targeted to children.  In January 2010, promoting healthy products during kids’ ad times became an official requirement for businesses that are part of the Council of Better Business Bureaus.  Furthermore, major junk-food companies like Coca-Cola and Hershey have made it their policy to not advertise to children under the age of twelve.</p>
<p><span id="more-980"></span></p>
<p>Why would these companies volunteer to cut down its advertisers to its most eager customers?  It’s probably not because they’re worried about the dental hygiene of America’s youth.  More likely, it’s because these food companies want to avoid government regulation.  If these companies change their programming strategies, they can keep the FCC, playing the authority power role, from imposing its own rules.</p>
<p>We should also consider the role of the Council of Better Business Bureaus, the committee responsible for establishing these new protocols for kids’ food and drink advertising.  Though the BBB theoretically functions as a facilitator that encourages upright business practices and tells consumers which businesses are operating fairly, many have questioned the BBB’s cozy relationship with the very companies that it is supposed to be monitoring.  As businesses pay to be part of the BBB, the council has a strong interest in keeping these businesses happy. If the BBB comes out with strong criticisms against a powerful business, this business could stop participating in the BBB, taking with it its crucial resource: money.  Therefore, it seems unlikely that the BBB was interested in looking out for the health of young TV fans, and more likely that it was trying to assist the businesses that it depends on for its own survival.  For more on the questionable BBB practices, check out this <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2009/jan/21/business/fi-lazarus21">LA Times article</a>.</p>
<p>Another strategy that food and drink companies have taken to avoid FCC regulations is to shift the target of the advertisements from kids to their parents.  Daytime broadcast programming has benefitted from this shift, as advertisers know that this is when some parents (including stay at home moms) watch TV.  Additionally, these advertisers have become more interested in the traditional primetime hours (especially 8pm) as this is a time when both parents and kids watch TV together.  Now more than ever, advertisers are willing to pay a lot for these times slots, which, in turn, encourages the networks to expand their family friendly primetime programming.  This is an example of the advertiser’s, or client’s, ability to influence the types of shows that networks, or producers, create and air.</p>
<p>This example shows the lengths that TV advertisers will go to in order to avoid government regulation.  By making some concessions and shifting their target audience, America’s food and drink companies can both evade strict government rules, and, at the same time, continue to create new generations of French fry fiends and soda slurpers.</p>

<p>As busy college students, many of us find it difficult to sit down to watch our favorite shows when they originally air. That’s what makes a website like <a href="http://www.hulu.com/">Hulu</a> so convenient—this online television option makes it easy to catch up on <em>Glee</em> or <em>The Office</em> in between classes (or parties).  Also attractive to college students is the fact that Hulu is free, as the site earns its money from advertisers rather than from users.  While Hulu is fantastic for busy TV fans, it is not necessarily ideal for television networks—while the networks are given a share of Hulu’s advertising revenue, some have deemed this percentage inadequate (check out this <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/03/business/media/03hulu.html?scp=1&amp;sq=hulu%20and%20comedy%20central&amp;st=Search"><em>New York Times</em> article</a>, which describes Comedy Central’s grievances with and temporary departure from Hulu).   Adding to the industry’s woes is the difficulty of measuring ratings from Hulu, which is also tied to profits, as networks use ratings as a resource to lure advertisers.  This dilemma was the topic of this &#8220;State of the TV Industry&#8221; panel at the February 15th TV Summit, an event hosted by the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences Foundation and <em>Variety</em>.</p>
<p><span id="more-892"></span></p>
<p>Television distribution has become extremely fragmented, providing audiences with a choice of where and how to watch TV shows.  Much like Tivo, a site like Hulu acts as a distributor that, in many ways, empowers audiences:  viewers aren’t bound to network-determined schedules and can watch their favorite shows when they want, free of charge.  The television industry’s effort to monetize this online content, a goal expressed by several members of the “State of the TV Industry” panel, creates a bit of a power struggle between audience and producer, with the distributor, Hulu, in the position of middleman with the ability to direct the flow of power.   However, the networks have some muscle when dealing with Hulu as they control a resource that is absolutely crucial to Hulu’s operation: content.  If a network is not satisfied with Hulu’s method of compensation, the network can simply withdraw its content from the site, which could cost Hulu viewers, and, as a result, money from advertisers.  Taking this power structure into consideration, we anticipate that Hulu will eventually shift into a completely subscription-based system (the site did recently add a premium option, <a href="http://www.hulu.com/plus">Hulu Plus</a>, which cost users $7.99 a month) in order to boost the percentage of its profits that it directs to the participating networks, which will ensure that these networks continue to provide Hulu with the content the site needs to hold onto audiences.</p>
<p>While much of the TV Summit discussion centered on the necessity of making a profit from online content, some panelists were more concerned with the quality of the content itself, with some industry insiders emphasizing the importance of inspired writers and emotionally-gripping story lines.  But when it comes to the issue of monetizing online television, it will be producers and investors, rather than TV writers or creators, who will exercise the most influence over this technological and financial issue.  However, if the networks’ monetization dreams do come true, audiences will, hopefully, demand top-notch quality if we’re asked to pay top-dollar to watch TV online.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lafayette, J.  (2011, February 1). MTV’s ‘Skins’ Continues Ratings Slide Except with Teens.  <em>Broadcasting &amp; Cable</em>. Retrieved from <a href="http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/463300-MTV_s_Skins_Continues_Ratings_Slide_Except_with_Teens.php">http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/463300-MTV_s_Skins_Continues_Ratings_Slide_Except_with_Teens.php</a>.</p>
<p>The new MTV show <em><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=skins+us+trailer&amp;aq=f">Skins</a>,</em> a program that depicts (quite explicitly) “the sex and drug habits of teens,” is already facing pressure from audiences and advertisers, even though the show has only aired three episodes.  Although MTV aims its programming towards the 12-34 year old demographic, <em>Skins</em> has been wildly popular with 12-17 year olds (omg!), which is troubling for many parents.  One major media advocacy organization, The Parents Television Council, labeled <em>Skins</em> the “’&#8217;most dangerous show&#8217; on TV for children.&#8221;  Even Viacom, which owns MTV, has acknowledged these concerns, suggesting the show may, in fact, violate child pornography laws.  This negative attention has also worried advertisers, many of whom have opted to remove their advertisements from MTV during <em>Skins&#8217; </em>time slot.</p>
<p><span id="more-731"></span>The outcry over <em>Skins</em> complicates that old media adage that sex sells.  <em>Skins</em>’ racy content has upset public advocacy groups, which have significant power to shape television programming.  While we often think of government regulation as the key way to address questionable media content, this example suggests that public advocacy organizations can also be effective by encouraging media producers to self-regulate.  As a public advocacy group, the PTC has the ability to draw negative attention to <em>Skins</em>, increasing the likelihood that other parents will think twice before allowing their own kids to watch the program.  Plus, networks know that if they fail to listen to advocacy groups&#8217; concerns, these groups can turn to the government to secure mandated content regulation.   These two resources, publicity and the threat of government-regulation, give advocacy groups like the PTC an edge when dealing with media producers like MTV, and could very well persuade MTV to dial back on <em>Skins</em>&#8216; adult content.</p>
<p>In addition to the PTC, many advertisers have also objected to<em> Skins</em>.  Not wanting to be associated with an increasingly stigmatized show, General Motors, Taco Bell, Schick, Subway, Wrigley, and H&amp;R Block have all removed their ads during <em>Skins</em>’ time slot.  Other sponsors who had secured product placement deals with MTV, including Clearasil, are also considering withdrawing their involvement with <em>Skins. </em>So, advertisers, which fill the power role of client, can also use their resources to motivate television networks to self-regulate their content.   When a client like Subway withdraws its ads from MTV during <em>Skins</em>&#8216; time slot, this is an example of a client exercising its power, or strategically withholding its resources.  As television networks rely on money from advertisers, MTV, again, has an interest in self-regulating its controversial material in order to hold onto advertisers and the money that they control.</p>
<p>Whether you think the uproar over <em>Skins</em> represents a move towards a sensible solution or senseless censorship, one thing’s for sure: the <strong>ombudspeople</strong> at MTV must be very busy.</p>
