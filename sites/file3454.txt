(2011, April 27). &#8216;Atlas Shrugged&#8217; producer promises two sequels despite terrible reviews, poor box office. <em>The Hollywood Reporter</em>.

The film, based on Ayn Rand&#8217;s long controversial 1957 novel of the same name, opened on April 15. This is probably news to many of this blog&#8217;s readers, and it&#8217;s news to us as well. In writing the novel &#8220;Atlas Shrugged,&#8221; Rand incorporated her philosophical viewpoints into a highly debated novel that has been drawing negative criticism but a devoted fanbase for decades. Rand, a philosopher and author, was known for developing the philosophical system of Objectivism, which advocated reason as the only method of gaining knowledge and emphasized laissez-faire (or hands-off) capitalism in politics. This should sound familiar, as the recent rapid rise of the Tea Party in American politics gave John Aglialoro, a producer/financier, the idea to finally bring a film version of the &#8220;unfilmable&#8221; &#8220;Atlas Shrugged&#8221; to the big screen. However, the film received an atrocious 9% score on Rotten Tomatoes (which measures critics&#8217; reviews), with only 3 positive reviews out of 35 overall. And with middling box office returns added to the public perception of the film, Aglialoro has spoken out against film critics for their hatred of &#8220;individualism&#8221; and stated his plans to make two follow-up films.<span id="more-1164"></span></p>
<p>Unlike most feature films produced through the Hollywood system, Aglialoro spent $10 million of his money to finance the film through an independent studio. &#8220;Atlas Shrugged: Part 1&#8221; also avoided conventional marketing norms and instead concentrated on the Internet and talk radio to get word out about the film and attract a niche audience of those who share Rand&#8217;s political views. Specifically, Aglialoro was hoping to attract Libertarians and Tea Party followers, an effort that seems to have at least partially worked. Despite the critical drubbing and poor box office, Rotten Tomatoes also indicates that 85% of the audience who voted on their website actually recommends the film. However, the film is becoming well-known for some of the harsh reviews it has received. Peter Travers of <em>Rolling Stone</em> gave the movie zero stars and said &#8220;the novel gets the l0w-budget, no-talent treatment and sits there flapping on screen like a bludgeoned seal,&#8221; while Vadim Rizov of <em>Boxoffice Magazine </em>called the film &#8220;lifeless as entertainment and incoherent as ideology.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aglialoro has accused professional film critics of having a political agenda while speaking out about the film. &#8220;It was a nihilistic craze. Not in the history of Hollywood has 16 reviewers said the same low things about a movie. They&#8217;re lemmings. What&#8217;s their fear of Ayn Rand? They hate this woman. They hate individualism,&#8221; he said in this <em>Hollywood Reporter </em>article. Aglialoro also indicated his desire to continue making adaptations of &#8220;Atlas Shrugged,&#8221; both because particular audiences have responded well to it and as a means of spiting the critics. He also acknowledged that future films should most likely have different marketing strategies to expose them to a wider audience, perhaps by partnering with a major studio or spending more money to advertise the films on television and open them on more theaters.</p>
<p>The limited success of &#8220;Atlas Shrugged: Part 1&#8221; with a narrow audience and the completely negative reaction to it from nearly everyone else shows many things about success in the film industry. To attract a broad audience and win the approval of film critics, filmmakers cannot simply rely on a cult audience to bring in profits. While many films in the past saw box office success despite critics&#8217; negative opinions, the reviews on &#8220;Atlas Shrugged: Part 1&#8221; were <em>so </em>bad that it likely deterred many from seeing the film. The lack of traditional marketing also likely contributed to the film&#8217;s failure. Aglialoro concentrated largely on getting fans of the book and Rand&#8217;s followers to come out to see the film, but the focus on this group was so specific that it alienated everyone else. The Internet can be an effective marketing enhancer when a film is already being promoted through print and other forms of mass media; however, it cannot be the sole marketing technique. &#8220;Atlas Shrugged: Part 1,&#8221; true to its title, was met with indifference from the general audience, and it remains to be seen whether Aglialoro&#8217;s hopes for parts 2 and 3 will be met with a similar response or worse&#8230;</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fernandez, Jay A. (2011, April 14). Roundtable: the writers behind summer&#8217;s biggest blockbusters (exclusive video). <em>The Hollywood Reporter. </em>Retrieved from <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/risky-business/roundtable-writers-summers-biggest-blockbusters-177491">http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/risky-business/roundtable-writers-summers-biggest-blockbusters-177491</a><a href="http://mediaindustries11.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/04/2558435938_dc8097fd79.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1106" src="http://mediaindustries11.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/04/2558435938_dc8097fd79-300x260.jpg" alt="" width="184" height="111" /></a></p>
<p>With the summer fast approaching, the pressure on Hollywood screenwriters is beginning to mount. Summer blockbusters or &#8220;tentpoles&#8221;, while not necessarily containing the same topics or plotlines, tend to share a lot of the same elements. Much like the season itself, summer blockbusters are designed by filmmakers and marketed by studios to &#8220;make you cheer, make you gasp, and make you laugh,&#8221; according to Ehren Kruger, screenwriter of <em>Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, </em>in a Hollywood Reporter roundtable discussion with Hollywood screenwriters. These blockbusters are not typically designed to capture the attention of Oscar voters; instead, studios pour countless amounts of money into these films&#8217; budgets in order to regain profits and more. &#8220;These movies are greenlit now based on pre-visualized animated sequences that are the action sequences or moments that are really designed to wow the audience or stand out in a trailer,&#8221; said Kruger. Kruger&#8217;s quote exemplifies how summer blockbusters are designed first and foremost to appeal to a widespread audience. In order to accomplish this, studios look at past moneymakers and formulas that tend to appeal to the masses, and often design these summer blockbusters with these precedents in mind. Fundamentally, the studios are out to maximize profits when making these blockbusters. The main objective isn&#8217;t always necessarily making a film with quality of the highest caliber. Instead, money is what makes the industries continue churning out these massively-budgeted films year after year.<span id="more-1104"></span></p>
<p>When writing these films in the first place, Hollywood screenwriters face pressure to come up with &#8220;fresh&#8221; ideas that will capture the attention of audiences. Additionally, they must keep in mind how their films can function as collaborative efforts with other industries. Cross-promotion is one of the most effective and essential forms of spreading the word about a film and creating a successful summer blockbuster. Cross-promotion is essentially when consumers of one product are targeted, in a marketing sense, by the promotion of another product. Summer blockbusters are well-known in Hollywood as utilizing cross-promotion; as an example, animated films aimed at children are often promoted through toys in kids&#8217; meals at fast food restaurants like McDonald&#8217;s and Burger King.</p>
<p>Similarly, companies often pay studio substantial amounts of money to have their products featured in some way in a film they believe might be popular, a practice known as product placement. A notable example of this is when Hershey paid Steven Spielberg and Universal to feature Reeses&#8217; Pieces in the film <em>E.T.</em>, which paid off when <em>E.T. </em>became a global success. Both cross-promotion and product placement are considered linking pins with the film industry, as money can be made both promoting films and other products in other industries, such as fast food restaurants.</p>
<p>Two upcoming summer blockbusters will use both product placement and forms of cross-promotional merchandising in order to enhance the visibility of these films in the marketplace. The upcoming superhero film <em>Green Lantern</em> will feature a prominent use of product placement. In the film, the main character&#8217;s mode of transportation is a Chevy Volt, a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle that has only been on the market since December 2010. To accomplish this, Chevrolet struck a deal with Warner Bros., <em>Green Lantern</em>&#8216;s studio, to feature the car prominently. This is an example of two separate industries collaborating financially in a mutually beneficial effort.</p>
<p>In terms of cross-promotion, DreamWorks&#8217; upcoming animated sequel <em>Kung Fu Panda 2 </em>will feature plush toys found in McDonalds&#8217; Happy Meals. In the <em>Hollywood Reporter</em> roundtable, the film&#8217;s screenwriter Jonathan Aibel said, &#8220;There&#8217;s nothing wrong with advertising as long as you feel like you&#8217;re not selling out your characters too much and you&#8217;re still being true to them.&#8221; This is likely a common mindset among the various people involved with making and advertising summer blockbusters. While the actual quality of these summer blockbusters is often hit or miss and/or up for debate, the fact remains that producers in the film industry have their eye on financial success. Above all else, the film industry is a business, and people involved with making these summer blockbusters want to make money.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>McClintock, Pamela. (2011, March 15). Why Disney&#8217;s &#8216;Mars Needs Moms&#8217; bombed. <em>The Hollywood Reporter</em>. Retrieved from http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/why-disneys-mars-needs-moms-167551.<a href="http://mediaindustries11.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/03/images.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-949" src="http://mediaindustries11.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/03/images.jpg" alt="" width="177" height="245" /></a></p>
<p>On Friday, March 11, Disney unveiled its latest animated theatrical release, the 3D motion-capture film &#8220;Mars Needs Moms.&#8221; The film was a production of the animation company ImageMovers, whose past works have included box office successes such as &#8220;The Polar Express&#8221; (2004) and &#8220;A Christmas Carol&#8221; (2009). Headed by acclaimed director Robert Zemeckis, ImageMovers specializes in a type of technology known as performance capture. This technology involves shooting films as if they&#8217;re live action and then converting them to animation in post-production. After the worldwide success of &#8220;The Polar Express,&#8221; Disney acquired ImageMovers in 2007, with hopes of imprinting its brand on part of their animated division. &#8220;Mars Needs Moms,&#8221; a story of a young boy who must battle against Martians after they have kidnapped his mother, is the company&#8217;s latest release. However, Disney&#8217;s hopes for financial success with the film were dashed when it took in a miniscule $6.9 million opening weekend, despite expensive 3D surcharges associated with ticket prices. With a budget of over $200 million including production and marketing expenses, Disney will now likely be swimming in red ink trying to recover costs of the ill-fated production.<span id="more-948"></span></p>
<p>In the weeks leading up to the film&#8217;s release, tracking figures had suggested that the film would not be a blockbuster and had tepid interest at best. However, Disney was still unprepared for the shockingly low figures that came in last weekend. According to <em>The Hollywood Reporter</em>, &#8220;<em>Mars </em>was always designed to open in the $20-30 million range. When tracking showed the film was in serious trouble, Disney downgraded its forecast. As the toon opened, Disney braced themselves for a $10 million opening. Even that turned out to be too optimistic.&#8221; Despite their disappointment at the film&#8217;s disastrous opening weekend, Disney may have had an inkling they would lose money on it. In March 2010, after first screening &#8220;Mars Needs Moms,&#8221; Disney dropped their association with ImageMovers. Still, Disney decided to release the film theatrically instead of shelving it completely or trying to sell the film&#8217;s distribution rights to another studio. It is likely Disney did this because they thought it would be more cost-effective to release the film themselves and simply cut future losses by eliminating their ties with ImageMovers.</p>
<p>In terms of the recent development of motion capture animation, ImageMovers perhaps had hoped their technology alone would suffice as a selling point for audiences. This rang true for &#8220;The Polar Express,&#8221; which was the first major motion picture to capitalize on the motion capture technology. Although there were other factors associated with that film&#8217;s popularity, such as a magical Christmas theme and the presence of actor Tom Hanks, the technology itself also likely contributed to the film&#8217;s success because it was considered revolutionary at the time. With &#8220;Mars Needs Moms,&#8221; however, the film&#8217;s technology was hardly promoted in its advertising, there was no star power associated with the film, and its awkward title likely turned off many viewers, especially the target audience of young boys. &#8220;The title shouldn&#8217;t have been &#8220;Mars Needs Moms,&#8221; but &#8220;Boys Need Not Come,&#8221; said an anonymous studio executive quoted in <em>The Hollywood Reporter</em>. Furthermore, the financial misfire of &#8220;Mars Needs Moms&#8221; comes on the heels of other space-related children&#8217;s pictures that also saw poor box office returns. Summit Entertainment&#8217;s 2009 film &#8220;Astro Boy&#8221; ($19.6 million total) and 20th Century Fox&#8217;s 2009 film &#8220;Aliens in the Attic&#8221; ($25.2 million total) did not provide encouraging results for films with this type of subject matter, and &#8220;Mars Needs Moms&#8221; has continued the unprofitable trend. If studios make an effort to revive the motion capture technology, despite Disney breaking its association with it, they may need to go back to the drawing board in order to create products that audiences actually want to see.</p>
