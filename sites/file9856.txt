This year several faculty members applied, and funds were awarded, as follows, to:<\/p>\n<p>Sharon Albert, for materials related to the study of Islam. These materials will support the expansion of course offerings in religion studies, but with an eye as well for Islam as it is taught in gender studies, African American studies, history, political science, and sociology.<\/p>\n<p>Amy Corbin, for materials on the intersection of film and other visual cultures (including painting and photography). These materials will support a number of film studies courses where other visual cultures are key, but the interdisciplinary nature of the topic will be of interest as well for areas such as anthropology, art, and gender studies.<\/p>\n<p>Kim Gallon, for African American studies, as offerings in this area are being expanded on campus. For example, materials will support a new course titled &#8220;Black Feminism&#8221; to be taught in spring of 2011. Other disciplines to benefit from these materials include American studies, women&#8217;s studies, media and communication, psychology, and political science.<\/p>\n<p>Paul McEwan and Andrew Oster, to build a recorded music collection. The collection will address broadly popular music in America, and specifically will support Andrew&#8217;s course titled &#8220;The History of Pop, Rock, and Soul Music in the United States,&#8221; and Paul&#8217;s &#8220;Media &amp; Society&#8221; course, both to be taught in the spring.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><em><strong>Infomaniac Tip<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.zotero.org\/\">Zotero<\/a>\u00a0is a freely available citation software (works only with\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.mozilla.com\/en-US\/firefox\/ie.html\">Firefox<\/a>\u00a0web browser) that stores information from websites, articles, and books that you visit, generating citations in a number of different formats.<\/p>\n<p>Even if you&#8217;re already using Zotero to store and cite your research, you might not know that Zotero will generate an entire works cited page with a single click.<\/p>\n<p>1.
