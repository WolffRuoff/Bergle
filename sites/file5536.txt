			<p>It was a soccer game that could have been an episode of <em>Family Ties</em>.</p>
<p>When the Muhlenberg men&#8217;s soccer team defeated Moravian, 5-0, last night, four of the players who contributed were two sets of brothers &#8211; junior midfielder Jacob Joseph, freshman forward Dan Joseph, junior forward Jeremy Katz and sophomore midfielder Oliver Katz.</p>

<p>Their coach was Sean Topping &#8217;98, the oldest of three Topping brothers to play for the Mules. And patrolling the Greyhound sideline was Todd Ervin &#8217;98, the middle of three Ervin brothers to play for Muhlenberg.</p>
<p>Brothers wearing the Cardinal &amp; Grey is a Mule tradition that dates back almost 20 years. The Josephs, Katzes, Toppings and Ervins are just four of nine sets of brothers to have played for Muhlenberg during that span: </p>
<ul>
<li>Cecconi        David (2003), Matt (2007-10)</li>
<li>Ervin            Eric (1991-94), Todd (1994-97), Dave (1996-99)</li>
<li>Hohman       Eric (1994-97), Johan (1996-99)</li>
<li>Joseph         Jacob (2010-12), Dan (2012)</li>
<li>Katz             Jeremy (2010-12), Oliver (2011-12)</li>
<li>Leischner     Greg (2005-08), Tim (2008-11)</li>

<li>Topping       Sean (1994-97), Shane (1996-99), Peter (1998-2001)</li>

<p>The City of Brotherly Love may be about an hour south of Muhlenberg, but Varsity Field in Allentown is the “Pitch of Brotherly Love.” </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“It was pretty neat back then – at one point we had three sets of brothers and everyone was starting or contributing,” said Topping, who also played with a son of a former Muhlenberg varsity player (Brian Krug ’97, son of Lee Krug ’68) and coached another (Justin Henning ’04, son of Jon Henning ’78).</p>
<p>“In high school, you don’t think about it, but when you’re in college and afterwards when you look back you realize how neat it was – especially in our case, winning championships and going to NCAA Tournaments together.”</p>
<p>Jacob Joseph played in the NCAA Tournament as a freshman in 2010 and would welcome the opportunity to go back with his brother as a teammate, although it’s not something he pushed for.</p>
<p>&#8220;I told him that I really enjoyed my experience and that he would fit in well,&#8221; said Jacob. &#8220;But I didn&#8217;t want to influence his decision by encouraging him too much. I wanted it to be his decision.&#8221;</p>
<div id="attachment_1374" style="width: 360px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/09/josephbrothers.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1374" class="size-full wp-image-1374" title="Joseph brothers" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/09/josephbrothers.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="373" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/09/josephbrothers.jpg 350w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/09/josephbrothers-281x300.jpg 281w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-1374" class="wp-caption-text">Jacob Joseph (15) and Dan Joseph (right) following the latter&#8217;s goal</p></div>
<p>Brotherly love turned into brotherly pride last night when Dan Joseph scored his first career goal seconds after entering the game late in the first half. Just four games into his career, Dan is only one behind Jacob for the family lead in goals scored for the Mules.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m excited for him,&#8221; said Jacob, who was on the field at the time to help his brother celebrate. &#8220;He&#8217;s a good player and a hard worker, and he deserves it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Katz brothers got into the act in the second half, with Jeremy assisting Oliver on the third goal of the game. It was the first career goal for Oliver and the first career point for Jeremy. It also was the first brother-to-brother pass resulting in a goal since 2003, when Ryan Smallwood assisted Evan against McDaniel in what became a Centennial Conference championship season for the Mules.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s no coincidence that the success of the program (an active streak of 26 consecutive non-losing seasons) has gone hand-in-hand with the steady stream of brothers that have come through the Red Doors of Muhlenberg.</p>
<p>“It says a lot about the program that an older sibling would come here and a younger sibling would follow,” said Topping. “It makes it a close-knit family when you have so many brothers come through, and others can see it.”</p>
<p>&#8220;Muhlenberg is a homey place,&#8221; says Jacob Joseph. &#8220;People who come here really enjoy being here. When [prospective students] get an inside view from a family member, they tend to like it.&#8221;</p>

			<p><em>The second weekend of the 2012-13 athletic year features a volleyball tournament, a throwback soccer rematch, two spring teams opening up competition &#8230; and the football home opener with a coach going for a major milestone.</em></p>
<p><strong>Football vs. Franklin &amp; Marshall (Saturday, 1:00)</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-104" title="Mule Marquee Matchup" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="237" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg 350w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1-300x203.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" /></a>It&#8217;s the home opener for Muhlenberg and the Centennial Conference opener for both teams. The CC promises to be especially competitive this year after going 7-3 in non-conference games last week. Included in that record are the Mules&#8217; 27-7 win at The Apprentice School and the Diplomats&#8217; last-second 35-28 win against a Washington and Lee team that was 8-2 last year.</p>
<p>The defenses will be on alert to stop three hot quarterbacks. F&amp;M&#8217;s E.J. Schneider was named CC player of the week after throwing for 270 yards and rushing for 110, while Muhlenberg QBs Dan Deighan and Joe Carlucci combined to pass for 337 yards.</p>
<p>F&amp;M leads the all-time series, 52-42-1, although the Mules won last year&#8217;s matchup, 34-13.</p>
<p>Mule head coach Mike Donnelly enters the game with a career record of 99-61 and goes for his 100th win against John Troxell, who was his assistant at Muhlenberg for four years before taking the head reins at F&amp;M.</p>

<p><strong>Volleyball hosts Buttermaker Tournament (Friday vs. Centenary, 3:00; vs. King&#8217;s, 7:00; Saturday opponents TBD, 10:00 and 2:00)</strong></p>
<p>Coming off its rousing five-set win against DeSales on Wednesday, Muhlenberg hosts the 15th Buttermaker Tournament. The Mules (4-1) are seeking their first title since 2005. This year&#8217;s nine-team field includes defending champion Moravian as well as Salisbury, a team that went 32-4 last year and is currently receiving votes in the AVCA Division III poll.</p>

<p>One of the biggest wins in program history came in 1995, when the Mules beat Ithaca 4-0 in an NCAA quarterfinal game at Varsity Field to advance to the &#8220;Final Four.&#8221; Nothing of the sort is at stake here, although Muhlenberg (2-0) is ranked 11th in Division III. Ithaca is 1-1-1.</p>

<p>This past weekend, the Muhlenberg football team experienced a rare trip. Our first regular season game was scheduled for Saturday, September 1, against an unfamiliar team, the Apprentice School Builders, located in Newport News, Virginia.</p>
<p>After grabbing a quick breakfast and a boxed lunch at 7 a.m. on Friday morning, we packed up the buses and were on our way to Newport News. The bus ride was a long one lasting about seven hours, which meant ample time for movies. The defensive bus had plenty of laughs as we watched <em>Fast Five</em>, <em>Animal House</em>, and <em>Dumb and Dumber</em>, while the offensive bus watched <em>Fast Five</em> and <em>Remember the Titans</em>.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/09/apprentice_field.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1353" title="Apprentice School field" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/09/apprentice_field-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/09/apprentice_field-300x199.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/09/apprentice_field.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>When we arrived at The Apprentice School’s football field, we were immediately greeted by longtime Newport News Shipyard employees. Since we had some time to burn, they agreed to give us a grand tour of the shipyard. As per shipyard policy, they began by passing a box around the bus and collecting all devices capable of taking photos, including cell phones, iPods and, of course, Chris Galletta’s iPad.</p>
<p>After the security measures were taken care of, we took a three-minute ride escorted by Newport News police to the main gate of the shipyard. Then our tour guides began telling us anything and everything there was to know about the shipyard and answering all of our questions along the way. The 45-minute bus tour was both relaxing and particularly interesting.</p>
<p>The shipyard has over 19,000 employees ranging in hundreds of specialties and fields. They specialize in the building of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers and submarines used by the U.S. Navy. During the tour, we saw the USS Theodore Roosevelt, which was launched in 1984, saw her first action in Operation Desert Storm in 1991, and is now being refueled and overhauled in the shipyard. The tour guides then pointed out the recently completed submarine building facilities due to rising demand of subs by the U.S. Navy.</p>
<p>We also saw the shipyard’s major project, the USS Gerald R. Ford. Construction on the 10 billion dollar, 1,100-foot aircraft carrier began in 2005, and the schedule calls for the ship to join the U.S. Navy’s fleet in 2015. The rest of the tour included an overview of the day-to-day progressions that occur in the massive shipyard.</p>
<p>It was fascinating to see how much work and effort goes into providing the U.S. Navy the necessary ships and subs to protect America.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/09/onimus_nn.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1354" title="Andrew Onimus" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/09/onimus_nn.jpg" alt="" width="425" height="291" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/09/onimus_nn.jpg 425w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/09/onimus_nn-300x205.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 425px) 100vw, 425px" /></a>On Saturday morning, the team checked out of the hotel and began our pregame routine. The weather was hot and humid but we came ready to play. Like any other football game we had our ups and downs, but the Mules came out on top with a 27-7 victory. We packed the bus returned to Allentown just before midnight.</p>
<p>The weekend was an overall great experience, a good time for team bonding, and a strong win to open up the 2012 season.</p>

			<p>It&#8217;s opening weekend of the 2012-13 season, and all seven Muhlenberg fall sports teams are in action &#8211; three at home, three others close by and one in Virginia. Here&#8217;s a quick look:</p>
<p><strong>Men&#8217;s Soccer vs. Elizabethtown (Friday, 5:00); vs. Cortland State (Saturday, 5:00)</strong></p>
<p>The Mules (10-6-1 last year) renew an old rivalry with Elizabethtown (10-7) in their season opener. In the late 1980s and early-to-mid 1990s, Muhlenberg and Elizabethtown were two of the &#8220;Big Three&#8221; (along with Messiah) of the Mid-Atlantic Region. The Blue Jays were the visitors for the first night game at Varsity Field in 1997. The teams haven&#8217;t met since 2008. Muhlenberg did play Cortland State (3-8-5) last year, winning 3-2.</p>

<p><strong>Women&#8217;s Soccer vs. Wilkes (Friday, 7:00); vs. Penn State Altoona (Saturday, 7:00)</strong></p>
<p>The Mules open their season against two teams that were in the postseason last year. Wilkes (8-6-3) made the Freedom Conference playoffs, while Penn State Altoona (14-5-3) lost the Allegheny Mountain Collegiate Conference championship game on penalty kicks and earned a bid to the ECAC South Tournament. After this weekend, Muhlenberg (6-10-2) has six straight road games over the next three weeks.</p>

<p><strong>Field Hockey vs. Scranton (Friday, 7:00); vs. Elizabethtown (Saturday, 2:00)</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg (5-12) played the same two opponents on opening weekend last year, losing to both on the road. Scranton was 12-6 last season, and Elizabethtown was 10-7, with both falling in the first round of their conference playoffs.</p>

<p><strong>Volleyball at Greyhound Premiere Invitational (starts Friday at 4:00)</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg (10-18 last year) starts the season with matches against Wilkes (3-22), King&#8217;s (3-20), Wesley (5-26) and host Moravian (23-13). The last time the Mules were in this tournament, 2008, they went 3-1 to finish in second place.</p>

<p><strong>Cross Country at Lehigh Invitational (Friday, 5:30)</strong></p>
<p>For the ninth straight year, the Mules open up at Lehigh&#8217;s Goodman Campus Course in a field that includes Division I opponents Lehigh, Lafayette and Mount St. Mary&#8217;s. Last year, Samantha Mayden was the top Division III runner in the women&#8217;s race, coming in seventh overall.</p>
<p><strong>Football at The Apprentice School (Saturday, 1:00)</strong></p>
<p>The last time the Mules were scheduled to play a regular-season game in Newport News (at Christopher Newport in 2003), the game was cancelled by Hurricane Isabel. No danger of that this year as Muhlenberg (7-3 last year) opens its 111th season with its first game ever against the Builders (2-8).</p>

Internet issues prevented further updates from Spain, but now that the team is back in the United States, here is a summary of the rest of the trip, which included a pair of shutout wins:</em></p>
<p><strong>Day 4: FC BARCELONA CAMP NOU STADIUM TOUR</strong></p>
<p>Today we visited FC Barcelona’s Camp Nou, which seats 98,000 passionate fans. I can only imagine what this place looks like when they are playing rivals Real Madrid.</p>
<p>We saw the away team’s locker room, media room, press room and the Presidential box. After the stadium tour it was time to contribute to Barca’s success by spending money in their Superstore next to the stadium. The rest of the day the team had free time in Old Barcelona City.</p>
<p><strong>Day 5: TRAINING/MONTSERRAT MONASTERY/GAME 2</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/08/msocspain_jupiter.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1337" title="Club Esportiv Jupiter" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/08/msocspain_jupiter-300x195.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="195" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/08/msocspain_jupiter-300x195.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/08/msocspain_jupiter.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Started off the morning training at UE Jupiter in a great little stadium with field turf in the middle of the city. It was a great training facility for the trip. </p>
<p>After a quick shower, we were back on the bus for a trip to Montserrat Monastery, set atop a 4,000-ft. mountain, 7 miles long and 3.5 miles wide. Montserrat is one of the most important pilgrimage spots in Spain. Thousands travel here every year to see and touch the medieval statue of La Moreneta (The Black Virgin), the patron saint of Catalonia – it is especially popular for newly married couples to seek her blessing. </p>
<p>The bus ride up to the monastery was quite interesting with the twisting and tight turns up the side of the mountain, not for those who don’t like heights. Once at the top you could go higher by taking the funicular ride up to the very top of the mountain. On a clear day you can see from the Pyrenees Mountains to the Mediterranean Sea.</p>
<p>After some hiking around the monastery it was off to our second game vs. UE Tarrega of the 3<sup>rd</sup> Division of Catalonia. Tarrega had a small, very fast turf field, built for the Spanish great first touch.</p>
<p>Tarrega decided to start some of their younger players (similar age to our players), a decision that I’m sure their coach regrets. We jumped all over them with two set piece goals in the middle part of the first half.</p>
<p>Our first goal came off a corner kick with a feed to the feet of Danny Way, who calmly placed the ball in the corner of the net to take a 1-0 lead. Our second goal came minutes later when Bucky Aronoff struck a beautiful direct kick into the box to the onrushing Cody Antonini, who headed the ball into the back of the net. </p>
<p>Jas Chojnowski made some big saves to keep the score 2-0 heading into half.</p>
<p>The second half was a different story as a whole new Tarrega lineup came out. We found out afterwards that these players where their actual starters.</p>
<p>You could tell immediately they were at a higher level and put us under immediate pressure for the first 15-20 minutes of the second half. We weathered the storm and ended up picking up a third goal late in the game off a PK, after Jeff Reinhart was fouled in the box while going to the goal. Antonini slotted home the PK for his second of the game to kill the game off. </p>
<p>A very good victory for the Mules and first on Spanish soil. We found out the next day that Tarrega club members were tweeting about the game and result! </p>
<p><strong>Day 6: TRAINING/SITGES MEDITERRANEAN RESORT TOWN</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/08/msocspain_training.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1338" title="training with FC Espanyol coach" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/08/msocspain_training-300x210.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="210" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/08/msocspain_training-300x210.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/08/msocspain_training.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>We had a morning training session with a coach from La Liga Club FC Espanyol. Jamie Fernandez Molina, who spent time in the States at Binghamton University, was our coach for the morning session. It was great to watch our squad trained by our Spanish counterpart. You could see how his training sessions reflected directly how the Spanish play soccer. </p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/08/msocspain_vball.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1335" title="volleyball at Sitges" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/08/msocspain_vball-300x245.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="245" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/08/msocspain_vball-300x245.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/08/msocspain_vball-366x300.jpg 366w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/08/msocspain_vball.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Next it was time to catch a train for a little fun at one of the Mediterranean’s most beautiful resort towns, Sitges. It was a quick 25-minute train ride down the coast to this gem of a town. Many of Barcelona’s elite, including the area’s professional soccer players, choose to make Sitges their home.</p>
<p><strong>Day 7: FIGUERES, SALVADOR DALI MUSEUM/GIRONA</strong></p>
<p>We departed for Figueres, which is known for artist Salvador Dali and his museum. We spent two hours in the museum on a self-guided tour, but you could have spent the entire day trying to make sense of his work. <a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/08/msocspain_dali.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1336" title="Dali Museum" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/08/msocspain_dali-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/08/msocspain_dali-225x300.jpg 225w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/08/msocspain_dali.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /></a>Very interesting to say the least. Dali built the museum around his work, making for a great tour.</p>
<p>Next we were off to Girona, which is a northern Catalan city known for its tight alleyways and river that splits the Old City from the more modern part of the city. The boys had free time to roam around the city.  </p>
<p><strong>Day 8: FUTSAL/OLD CITY FREE TIME/GAME 3</strong></p>
<p>We started the day off walking down to the local university and taking over their outdoor futsal court (a small court meant for 5v5). The court was very slick and more time was spent trying to avoid falling on your butt than was playing soccer.</p>
<p>The parents and my wife took advantage of a light morning to get out of the city for a wine-tasting tour. A tour of the winery and instruction on how they make cava (champagne) followed by some taste testing sounded like a good time to me! </p>
<p>The boys had some free time after training to find some souvenirs on La Rambla or down in the Old City.</p>
<p>Game 3 was actually a home game for us as we were playing at our training ground at UE Jupiter against Iberos FC of Madrid. Unfortunately they were no match for the Mules and we trounced Iberos 8-0.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/08/msocspain_uberos.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1339" title="Mules with Iberos FC" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/08/msocspain_uberos.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="175" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/08/msocspain_uberos.jpg 500w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/08/msocspain_uberos-300x105.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>Antonini had a couple goals, Nate Squire had a double, and Joey Roberts got in on the scoring with a very nice half volley. Goalies – Chojnowski, Nutovits and Pinto – kept a clean sheet for a second game in a row. It was a good confidence booster ending the trip thrashing the Spanish side.</p>
<p><em><a title="Goals vs. Iberos" href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/08/msoc_goals_vs_iberos.wmv">Click here for video of two of the goals.</a></em></p>
<p><strong>Day 9: TRAINING/BEACH/FAREWELL DINNER</strong></p>
<p>We had our last training session of the trip this morning. The boys were in good spirits after the game the previous day. We ended the training session playing in a small caged field made for 5v5 games on field turf. Even the coaches jumped in a played a bit.</p>
<p>The group had some much-needed free time to end the trip. Many of the players headed back to the beach to sport their Muhlenberg red Speedos one last time! Others went searching for souvenirs for family and friends. </p>
<p>My wife and I took time to head back to the Sagrada Familia to see the inside of the cathedral. We had been only around the outside with the squad and it looked too amazing not to see the inside of the cathedral. It did not disappoint as Gaudi designed the inside columns to look like trees branching out. Truly amazing architectural design. Words don’t do this cathedral justice. </p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/08/msocspain_food.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1340" title="Spanish cuisine" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/08/msocspain_food-257x300.jpg" alt="" width="257" height="300" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/08/msocspain_food-257x300.jpg 257w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/08/msocspain_food.jpg 325w" sizes="(max-width: 257px) 100vw, 257px" /></a>The group met up later on in the evening at a nicer restaurant off of the La Rambla strip for our farewell dinner of the trip. It was a nice evening to reflect on what we had done and seen over the last nine days. </p>
<p>I believe all enjoyed the past nine days and will forever remember the memories we made in Barcelona. I would like to thank the Attanasios (Rob &amp; Donna), Plifkas (Greg &amp; Leslie), Todd Lehman, Chris Pachuta, AJ Barnold and last but not least my wife Kristen for helping keep the boys in line and making this a wonderful trip. </p>
<p>Adios Amigos!</p>

			<p>Typical study abroad experiences involve immersion in an intriguing and unfamiliar culture, overcoming language barriers, experiencing college classes at different institutions, making new friends and accumulating countless memories to share with family and friends at home.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/08/deruiterhs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1326" title="Ian de Ruiter" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/08/deruiterhs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>For rising senior Ian de Ruiter, his study abroad experience in Maastricht last spring was all of the above but with a slight twist. The Muhlenberg lacrosse player spent several days of his semester-long stay in the Netherlands successfully trying out for the Dutch National Lacrosse Team.</p>
<p>De Ruiter, who was born in the United States and played for nationally ranked John Jay High School in his hometown of Cross River, N.Y., has a Dutch passport, making him eligible to try out for the national team.</p>
<p>Former Muhlenberg teammate Brent Siebold ’11, who also tried out for the Dutch National Team during his study-abroad stint in Maastricht, brought this eligibility to de Ruiter’s attention and encouraged him to try out for the team.</p>
<p>De Ruiter, whose given name is Hendrick, that of his Dutch-born paternal grandfather, is quite familiar with the country because he visits his family there every other Christmas.</p>
<p>“My dad was born and raised in Holland and his whole family lives there,” says de Ruiter. “So it was natural for me to go there to study and play lacrosse.”</p>
<p>The 2012 European Lacrosse Championship was held in Amsterdam, the capital of the Netherlands, this past June, so de Ruiter was able to compete for the Dutch team on their home turf.</p>
<p>De Ruiter arrived in Holland and spent a week with his family before beginning a rigorous 10-day training camp in preparation for the tournament.<a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/08/deruiter31.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1322" title="Ian de Ruiter" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/08/deruiter31-300x210.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="210" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/08/deruiter31-300x210.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/08/deruiter31-428x300.jpg 428w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/08/deruiter31.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>“It was a little more intense than I thought it would be,” he laughs. “They had us out in the woods and wanted us really focusing on training and getting ready for the tournament. Eat, sleep, practice. That was it. They didn’t even want us going on Facebook.”</p>
<p>De Ruiter explains that the national team consisted of several Dutch players and five North Americans who, like him, have Dutch passports but don’t live in Holland.</p>
<p>Two of the North Americans on the team were from Canada and the other three were from the United States. Ironically, de Ruiter knew the Dutch players from the tryouts but didn’t know any of the North American players.</p>
<p>The players from Holland, all of them still in school, ranged in age from 23 to 30 years old. De Ruiter, at 21, was one of the youngest players on the team.</p>
<p>De Ruiter says that lacrosse is not as popular in Holland as it is in America and the sport is played primarily by college students. Even though the game was slightly different from what he usually experiences as a defender in the highly competitive Centennial Conference, playing in Europe was undoubtedly a positive experience.</p>
<p>“Each team had a couple of really, really good players which made it a solid game overall,” he states.</p>
<p>Three-time All-American goalie Grant Zimmerman from the University of North Carolina was one of de Ruiter’s fellow Americans on the Dutch team.</p>
<p>“At Muhlenberg, it’s a lot more organized because everyone has been playing a lot longer,” he continues. “Physically and athletically, the play in Europe is just as good. It actually gets more physical there because there are a lot of missed passes, which creates chaotic situations.”</p>
<p>Right from the get-go, de Ruiter had the opportunity to play in the Olympic stadium in Amsterdam in front of 2,000 lacrosse fans. Amsterdam hosted the Olympic Games back in 1928.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/08/deruiter11.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1323 alignleft" title="Ian de Ruiter" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/08/deruiter11.jpg" alt="" width="275" height="242" /></a>“It was the first time lacrosse was played there since it was a demonstration sport in the early Olympics,” he recalls. “People were going nuts and everyone was dressed up in orange. We were playing Germany, which is Holland’s biggest rival in everything. The fans were doing Dutch cheers when we walked out. It was really cool to be playing for the entire country, and the fans were really passionate.”</p>
<p>The Dutch National Team finished fourth out of 17 teams in the European Championship despite having a 3-6 record in group play. They lost to Sweden in the tournament consolation game by one goal, just missing out on a bronze medal.</p>
<p>According to de Ruiter, his team struggled during the group stage of the tournament because they were in the toughest group with the most competitive teams. Consequently, they had a low seed coming into the final tournament and had to play the Czech Republic in the first round, the best team in the group below.</p>
<p>“That game was really exciting. We won in triple OT.”</p>
<p>The Dutch then faced an inexperienced Israeli team in the second round and came away with another victory. In the semifinals they were matched up against England.</p>
<p>“They were the best team in the entire tournament by far,” states de Ruiter. “We played them earlier during the group stage and they beat us pretty well. This time we hung in with them for half of the game.”<a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/08/deruiter21.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1325" title="Ian de Ruiter" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/08/deruiter21-195x300.jpg" alt="" width="195" height="300" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/08/deruiter21-195x300.jpg 195w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/08/deruiter21.jpg 339w" sizes="(max-width: 195px) 100vw, 195px" /></a></p>
<p>Despite the loss to Sweden in the next game de Ruiter says it was a pretty significant accomplishment to make it as far as they did in the tournament and finish fourth in the final standings.</p>
<p>With training camp and tournament play, the team only had one day off, but de Ruiter says they made the most of it.</p>
<p>“We rented bikes with a bunch of Dutch guys on the team and they took us around to cool spots to eat. It was fun to go around with the locals. I like how laid back it is there. It’s a city but it’s very relaxed.”</p>
<p>De Ruiter says the language barrier wasn’t a problem because all of the Dutch players can speak English, making it easy to communicate off and even on the field, where some Dutch terms are used.</p>
<p>“On the field it’s a mix of Dutch and English. I’m able to understand the Dutch commands they use even though I can’t actually speak the language,” he states.</p>
<p>De Ruiter believes one of the most important things he learned while playing for the national team, and something he would like to bring back to his team at Muhlenberg, didn’t have to do with lacrosse skills.</p>
<p>“They really focused on team building and creating a close knit group when we were there. The team would hang out and watch movies. It wasn’t all about trying to get better at lacrosse. I want to get new freshmen involved and build a close family atmosphere among the team here at Muhlenberg.”</p>
<p>De Ruiter will graduate shortly after the lacrosse season concludes in the spring. After graduation, the finance major hopes to get a job with Merrill Lynch, where he interned this summer. He does, however, plan to keep lacrosse in his life.</p>
<p>“If I have the chance, I’m definitely going to try out for the Dutch National Team again. It was an awesome experience and I really enjoyed it.”</p>

Head coach Sean Topping sent back the following recap of the first few days:</em></p>
<p><strong>Day 1: ARRIVAL/ESPANYOL MATCH</strong></p>
<p>After a long flight from JFK<a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/08/msocspain2.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1307" title="Espanyol stadium" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/08/msocspain2.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="240" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/08/msocspain2.jpg 320w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/08/msocspain2-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /></a> to Paris and then a sprint through customs we just barely got everyone aboard our connection to Barcelona. We finally arrived at our hotel at around 3:30 p.m. … A quick shower, a quick dinner, and then we boarded the bus to go watch a friendly between Espanyol and Montpellier HSC (French champions last year). </p>
<p>It was an enjoyable match to watch, with the home team winning 2-0. The group was starting to fade during the match as many were caught falling asleep &#8230; After the match, we headed back to the hotel for some much-needed sleep.</p>
<p><strong>Day 2: GAME/LA RAMBLA</strong></p>
<p>After our much-needed sleep we were up early and off to our first match against U.E. Avia in Berga, about one hour outside Barcelona. The town of Berga was at the foot of a small mountain and was a picturesque setting. </p>
<p>The field was a tight turf field that was very fast, not good when you’re playing the Spanish, who can move the ball quickly. We quickly found out that if we give the ball away we might not see it back for a while.</p>
<p>They were a professional team in the Spanish 5 division, where all of the players are paid a bit to play while also holding full-time jobs. We struggled to get a rhythm in the first half and gave up a goal after giving the ball away outside our box. We went down 2-0 after the referee (arbitro) gave a very soft direct kick just outside our box.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1306" title="Mules with U.E. Avia" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/08/msocspain5.jpg" alt="" width="564" height="299" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/08/msocspain5.jpg 564w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/08/msocspain5-300x159.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/08/msocspain5-500x265.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 564px) 100vw, 564px" />Needless to say we were happy to hear the halftime whistle. The second half started much better as we looked more relaxed and started to have some opportunities at goal. We cut the deficit in half when Chris Royer cut the ball inside and found Danny Way over top, who controlled the ball and slid it into the far corner underneath the GK for our first goal of the trip.</p>
<p>We pressed for an equalizer but it never came and so we lost 2-1 in a well-played match by both sides.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/08/msocspain3.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1309" title="beach at Barcelona" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/08/msocspain3.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="320" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/08/msocspain3.jpg 240w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/08/msocspain3-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px" /></a>After the match we headed back to the hotel to change and then onto the metro and down to La Rambla (the main strip down to the water) for some dinner. My wife, assistant coach A.J. Barnold and I headed with some others down to check out the beach scene once arriving downtown. Needless to say the tapas food beachside did not disappoint! </p>
<p><strong>Day 3: GAUDI/OLYMPIC PARK/BEACH</strong></p>
<p>Up early once again, the team went on a quick run to FC Barcelona’s stadium Camp Nou. After a quick shower, we were back on the bus for a city tour.</p>
<p>We drove past couple of Antoni Gaudi works of art (buildings he constructed). The architecture was amazing to see! Next on thetour was a stop at Park Guell, where Gaudi built most of the buildings and infrastructure in the park with interesting benches, hallways and more.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/08/msocspain4.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1308" title="Park Guell" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/08/msocspain4.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="240" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/08/msocspain4.jpg 320w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/08/msocspain4-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /></a>Next was a stop at the famous Sagrada Familia, Gaudi’s cathedral that is still being built today and will not be finished until 2026, 100 years after his death. Back on the bus and the next stop was at the 1992 Olympic Stadium, where the opening and closing ceremonies took place overlooking the city. </p>
<p>The team decided it was some time for some fun and so we spent three hours today at the beach, where to my surprise a few boys got into the European spirit and wore red speedos. Tonight we will be heading back downtown for a tapas dinner.</p>

			<p><em><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/02/shegoskihs.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-781" title="Jessica Shegoski" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/02/shegoskihs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>A couple of weeks ago, recent Muhlenberg graduate Jessica Shegoski <a title="Bagels and Lax, Part 1" href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/?p=1249">wrote about the first half of her lacrosse trip to Europe and Israel</a>, in which she helped Israel win the championship at the European Lacrosse Festival in Amsterdam.</em></p>
<p><em>Here is her report on the second half of the trip, which involved a series of clinics designed to introduce the sport of lacrosse to Israelis &#8211; as well as plenty of sightseeing.</em></p>
<p><strong>July 1</strong></p>
<p>Woke up this morning to another glorious, I mean FULL day of traveling. The team was split up on a couple different flights to either head home to the states, head home to Israel, or like me head to Israel to coach and play.</p>
<p>The first leg of our flight was Amsterdam to Bucharest (Romania). The airport was small in terms of United States standards. We had to deplane by walking down a set of stairs to a bus that took us to the terminal and had to take a similar bus back out to the tarmac for our flight to Tel Aviv. We got to Tel Aviv around 8:30 at night and caught a cab to our hostel to meet the two other teammates who had arrived ahead of us. The four of us hung out and walked the beach until everyone else who was staying at the hostel arrived around 2:00 am.</p>
<p>Since everyone felt gross from traveling all day, we all decided the smartest decision was to throw on bathing suits and jump into the ocean at 2:30 in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>July 2</strong></p>
<p>We had no clinics or games planned for today so everyone took complete advantage of being right on the beach. By 11:00 am everyone who was staying in the hostel [was] on the beach, and none of us left the beach for the rest of the day (except perhaps to grab food and more water). </p>
<p><strong>July 3</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_clinic1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1286" title="lax clinic 1" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_clinic1.jpg" alt="" width="295" height="168" /></a>This morning there was a clinic south of Tel Aviv, and after coaching we all hung out on the beach. As we were sitting on the beach we all decided that we wanted to be All-American (literally) for the next day (July 4), so the girls headed to find clothing to wear and a special piece of clothing for the boys.</p>
<p><strong>July 4 (Happy Independence Day America)</strong></p>
<p>Clinic #2, this time in Netanya with a group of low-income and at-risk kids who were initially more interested in the soccer ball someone had instead of lacrosse. It was funny how sassy some of the little girls were, but they were very fun to teach and work with.  </p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_swimsuit.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1291" title="American swimsuits" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_swimsuit.jpg" alt="" width="280" height="378" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_swimsuit.jpg 280w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_swimsuit-222x300.jpg 222w" sizes="(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px" /></a>Once the clinic ended it was off to the beach for us, the girls sporting their newly acquired American flag bikinis and the guys in their lovely American flag swimsuits.</p>
<p><strong>July 5</strong></p>
<p>Clinic #3 &#8211; This time we traveled to Kraft Stadium in Jerusalem to coach. This was the first clinic where the majority of the kids attending did speak English, which made coaching a little bit easier. After coaching all morning we were given the day to explore Jerusalem (where the majority of us had previously been on other trips).  </p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_westernwall.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1285" title="Jessica Shegoski at the Western Wall" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_westernwall.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="256" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_westernwall.jpg 450w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_westernwall-300x170.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a>We headed towards the Jaffa Gate into the Old City and made our way to the Western Wall, where we placed our notes into the ancient cracks in the wall. (It is Jewish tradition to write a prayer or note on a small slip of paper and then deposit it in the cracks of the wall.)</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_helmet.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1290" title="women's players in helmets" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_helmet.jpg" alt="" width="244" height="326" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_helmet.jpg 244w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_helmet-224x300.jpg 224w" sizes="(max-width: 244px) 100vw, 244px" /></a>After exploring most of the afternoon, we made our way back to Kraft Stadium (yes the same Krafts of Patriots football fame) to get changed for our games. The two men’s club teams (Jerusalem and Tel Aviv) played three games, and the women’s team had exhibition intrasquad games in between the men’s games. As the men’s third game was winding down, some of the women’s team joked that we wanted to play with them too and threw on full pads and tried to sneak our way onto the field. But it didn’t work.</p>
<p><strong>July 6</strong></p>
<p>Woke up early to get on the bus for our team retreat up north. Thank you to the UJA Federation of New York for sponsoring the retreat. Both the Americans and the Israelis boarded our coach bus early in the morning to begin our drive to Caesarea, a city built by Herod the Great that served as the capital when Palestine was under Roman control and was used through the time of the Crusades as a major port. After touring the ruins we got back on the bus to head to the northern port city <a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_haifa.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1289" title="Haifa" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_haifa.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="332" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_haifa.jpg 250w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_haifa-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px" /></a>of Haifa, where we quickly ate lunch and then went to the Bahi Gardens (the hanging gardens of Haifa), which house the shrine of the Bab. The gardens were beautiful and so amazingly well manicured.</p>
<p>Then it was off to the city of Akko, which is across the bay from Haifa and one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world.  After exploring Akko and all its back alleys and markets, we got back on the bus to drive to the kibbutz that we were staying at for the weekend. The guesthouse at Kibbutz Nof Ginnossar was basically a hotel and we were right on the Kinneret (Sea of Galilee, Israel’s largest freshwater lake). The guesthouse and the Kinneret are located in a valley, and because of this we were able to sit on the shoreline and watch the moon rise up and over the mountains.</p>
<p><strong>July 7</strong></p>
<p>Another early morning to explore more of northern Israel; our first stop was the Golan Heights. We all piled into Jeep Wranglers with extended beds and started our off-roading trip up the mountains that surround the fertile valleys of the Golan. While you drive through the Golan you experience something that you don’t encounter in the States: Barbed wire surrounds areas that are marked with signs that read “Caution: Mines.” This is because the area was disputed between Israel and Syria and is scattered with still-live mines and bombed-out bunkers.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_golan.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1288" title="Jessica Shegoski at the Golan Heights" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_golan.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="263" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_golan.jpg 350w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_golan-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" /></a>After off-roading we headed to a kibbutz that I had visited on my previous trip to Israel. [Then] we headed to Mt. Bental, which holds a bunker that looks out on Damascus and to this day can be mobilized in the case of a threat.</p>
<p>After being outside in the heat all day we headed to the Majrasa part of the Jordan River and rafted down it.</p>
<p><strong>July 8</strong></p>
<p>Another early morning. We checked out of the guesthouse and headed to Karmiel to coach a bunch of clinics at a large summer camp. Watching the kids’ faces light up when they catch their first pass or learn how to cradle is well worth it.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_clinic2.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1287" title="lax clinic 2" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_clinic2.jpg" alt="" width="263" height="180" /></a>We played a mock game of lacrosse, where the guys and girls mixed teams and played with modified girls’ rules. Some of the girls we had coached began a cheerleading section, which only egged us on to try moves that were a little silly but got the girls to laugh and smile. After playing some of the kids wanted autographs and hugs, which was a cool feeling.</p>
<p>After coaching we headed to Wingate, an IDF (Israel Defense Force) base. This base is Israel’s National Center for Physical Education and Sport and is the national training center for Israel’s Olympic team. While there we watched a combat solider go through a practice street-clearing drill with a semi-automatic weapon. We then went to the obstacle course that every solider has to pass during basic training. Some of us tried about half of the course but stopped when we were told we had to crawl through the sandy, rocky dirt, because we weren’t in pants.</p>
<p><strong>July 9</strong></p>
<p>Another clinic day, and this time only four or five people went, so the rest of us took advantage of the day and spent it on the beach.</p>
<p><strong>July 10</strong></p>
<p>Woke up to another beautiful day in Tel Aviv, and the girls decided that because it was a Tuesday we were going to head toward the shuk for the artists’ fair. The handmade goods that the artists made were beautiful. I believe everyone bought something as a reminder of this trip to Israel and the experience. After a successful time in the shuk, we went to Netanya to coach another clinic that afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>July 11</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_clinic3.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1294" title="lax clinic 3" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_clinic3.jpg" alt="" width="325" height="275" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_clinic3.jpg 325w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_clinic3-300x253.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 325px) 100vw, 325px" /></a>Early wakeup call to drive to southern Tel Aviv to coach (this is my last clinic in Israel because I fly out at 5:00 am tomorrow).  The kids at this clinic spoke a good amount of English, which made it a little bit easier to coach. One of the girls thought it was funny to run up to us while coaching, tickle us and then run away giggling.</p>
<p>After coaching we all headed down to the beach until we had to get ready for our games later that day in northern Tel Aviv. At the games we had a huge group of people watching us, and there were even a couple of reporters there, which made us all happy because it meant that the sport and the program were gaining recognition in Israel. The men were playing for the Zimmerman Cup for the second year in Israel and the women held an exhibition intrasquad game in between the men’s games.</p>
<p>After everyone finished playing we finished up by celebrating and filming the last bit of footage for our “Call Me Maybe” video. </p>
<p><strong>July 27</strong></p>
<p>I’ve been home for about two weeks now, and I still cannot believe that my time in Europe and Israel has come to an end. Being able to represent a nation that I have always been connected to and being able to teach a sport that I love to children was incredibly fulfilling.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_israelbanner.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1252" title="Israel lacrosse banner" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_israelbanner.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="240" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_israelbanner.jpg 320w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_israelbanner-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /></a>The hope is to continue to build the program from the bottom up in Israel so that the two men’s club teams continue to grow (and more teams are added) and that it becomes a sport that is recognized and played throughout the country. Fingers crossed Israel will have a women’s team representing them in 2013 at the World Cup in Canada and a men’s team representing them in 2014 at the World Championship in Colorado.</p>
<p>The program is still in its infancy and can use all the help it can get. Any and all donations would be greatly appreciated to help build the program and to help grow the sport of lacrosse internationally. Thank you in advance for all of your help to get me to reach my goal of furthering the sport.</p>
<p>Any and all donations can be sent to the below address, and in the notes section of the check please write Jessica Shegoski.</p>

<p>The men&#8217;s soccer uniforms did not have much in the way of markings until the late 1970s. Since the mid-1990s, the kicking Mule logo has been featured prominently on the jerseys.</p>
<p>And although the uniforms may have changed over the years, the success of the program has remained constant. The Mules enter 2012 with a streak of 26 straight non-losing seasons.</p>
<p>What team do you want us to feature next Thursday?</p>

<p><strong>June 22</strong></p>
<p>Today’s the day; time to represent Israel on the international level as a member of the first-ever Israel National Women’s Lacrosse Team. </p>
<p>On the way to Newark Airport my dad missed the exit off of 287 onto the Turnpike, which should have been a red light to me that it would be a long day of travel. We boarded the plane, and once boarding ended, a thunderstorm that had been threatening all day began. What was supposed to be a 6:15pm flight to Amsterdam turned into an 11pm-ish flight. Supposedly a bolt of lightning hit the ground near the plane and took out an electrical mechanism in the belly of the plane. Unfortunately the closest replacement part was at JFK, and that was driven to Newark at rush hour on a Friday night (not the easiest thing to do).</p>
<p>I ended up sleeping the entire plane ride into Amsterdam and arrived mid-morning on June 23.</p>
<p><strong>June 23</strong></p>
<p>Finally arrived in Amsterdam ready to lax it up for the next week or so.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_swag.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1251" title="Isareli lacrosse gear" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_swag.jpg" alt="" width="287" height="372" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_swag.jpg 287w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_swag-231x300.jpg 231w" sizes="(max-width: 287px) 100vw, 287px" /></a>After such terrible luck on my flight into Amsterdam, my luck turned around in the airport. I was waiting for my ride to get to our accommodations (the Amsterdam Bos), and someone walked up to me and asked if I was with Israel Lacrosse because he saw my stick bag. Turns out he was one of the men’s festival team coaches and coaches full time at Kean University in New Jersey, so I didn’t have to wait alone. </p>
<p>A couple minutes later our ride arrived and it was off to the Bos. When I arrived at my cabin none of the other girls were at the campsite (yes we stayed at a campsite, think sleepaway camp but with all adults … see photos for accommodations); some who had arrived earlier in the day had gone into Amsterdam while others were still on their way. I ended up going grocery shopping with some of the guys and hanging around until the other girls showed up.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_camp.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1250" title="campsite" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_camp.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="185" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_camp.jpg 500w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_camp-300x111.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>Once all the girls got back in from town and flights it was time for the best part of the day, getting out swag (hello new stick, uniforms, warmups, etc.). We also did introductions; the team is made up of an amazing group of females.</p>
<ul>
<li>Liz: ex-George Washington player from the Baltimore area (roommate)</li>
<li>Sarah (aka Ha): ex-Franklin and Marshall basketball and lacrosse player (roommate)</li>
<li>Steph: NYU grad and Israeli army personnel (roommate)</li>
<li>Carrie: Yale grad and Israeli army personnel (roommate)</li>
<li>Andi: Bahamas native who got to Israel via England and Hotlanta</li>
<li>Caitlin: ex-Tufts player from Massachusetts</li>
<li>Alyson: ex-Hopkins player, sister of Caitlin</li>
<li>Molly: ex-Columbia player, oldest sister to Caitlin and Al</li>
<li>Mia: current American player from Beth Tflioh</li>
<li>Miri: current Chapman player from Cali</li>
<li>Alicia: current med student in Israel</li>
<li>Tash: current master’s student in Israel from England</li>
<li>Sarah: ex-Yale player from the mainline area</li>
<li>Rachael: currently an Israeli (whose goal is to make the entire team move to Israel)</li>
<li>Felissa: the baby of the team, current high school player from Pittsburgh who will be playing at Stanford</li>
<li>Taylor: current Wheaton College (Mass.) player</li>
<li>Jenna: ex-Yale player from Baltimore area</li>
<li>Kim (Dubs): ex-Hopkins player who went to high school with Jenna</li>
<li>Coaches: Bonnie Rosen (Temple) and Peter Freidensohn</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>June 24</strong></p>
<p>Woke up with Liz and Sarah to a cold and rainy day (not the ideal practice weather but pretty normal for those of us lucky enough to play a spring sport in the Lehigh Valley). After complaining about how much we didn’t want to get wet or cold we all sucked it up, ate breakfast, and met the rest of the team to drive over to the practice fields.</p>
<p>After a solid and yes cold, wet practice the team headed to the men’s game against Norway, then it was back to the Bos, or da Bos as it became termed, to get warm and clean up for the huge program-wide dinner that we had that night.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_israelbanner.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1252" title="Israel lacrosse banner" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_israelbanner.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="240" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_israelbanner.jpg 320w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_israelbanner-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /></a>I cannot begin to describe how amazing it feels to be part of an organization like Israel Lacrosse and to know that we are the pioneers for the many national teams to come. As an organization, we ended up cramming three teams worth of players plus coaches, trainers and supporters into a pub near the practice fields and had a fun dinner.</p>

<p><strong>June 26</strong></p>
<p>Another full day of game play in Amsterdam. The team is gelling really well together. We lost one game today and knowing my luck we did so by only one goal, which only made me think about Muhlenberg and my girls on the team.</p>
<p>Tonight the women’s team went out for a team dinner at one of the local pubs. Some of us ordered dinner like little kids and got chicken nuggets and fries, while others were more adventurous and ordered the special, which was a locally caught fish.</p>
<p><strong>June 27</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_israel2.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1254" title="Jessica Shegoski" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_israel2.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="380" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_israel2.jpg 375w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_israel2-296x300.jpg 296w" sizes="(max-width: 375px) 100vw, 375px" /></a>Three more games today (all wins). After a great day of lax the team rushed home to da Bos to get showered and be tourists in Amsterdam. After a quick wardrobe change we all drove into Amsterdam together to explore the Anne Frank house (a historic point that was number one on almost every team member’s list).</p>
<p>The physical house and the rooms that the Frank family and their friends lived in were much more spacious then I had imagined. One of the things that I found interesting about the house was that when Otto Frank (Anne’s father) was consulted about turning it into a historical site, he was adamant about not setting the rooms up as they were, so the rooms are empty other than some TV screens running footage of friends and family speaking. There is a small diorama model that shows the setup of the full apartments, though.</p>
<p>After exploring the Anne Frank house the team went into Rembrandt Square to grab food prior to going to the European Premiere of the movie <em>Crooked Arrows</em>.</p>
<p><strong>June 28</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_israel3.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1255" title="Jessica Shegoski" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_israel3.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="359" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_israel3.jpg 350w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_israel3-292x300.jpg 292w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" /></a>Last two games of the tournament to decide where we would be placed for the finals round. Luckily for us, we finished out the day and went in placed second for the festival tournament, which basically solidified our place in the championship game the next day.</p>
<p>Since we only had two games we had a lot more free time during the afternoon and at night. After our games, we split into smaller groups, dropped all of our gear in one of the cars and made our way to the bus station. I guess it was our lucky day on the bus because none of us had to pay our fare into Amsterdam. Turns out it was the bus driver’s birthday and he was giving away some free rides, or maybe our team was just too overwhelming ha ha.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_friends.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1256" title="Jessica Sheogski and teammates" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_friends-300x237.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="237" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_friends-300x237.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_friends-379x300.jpg 379w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_friends.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Our first stop in Amsterdam was food and being that we are the Israeli team, of course, we all walked into a felafel place and satisfied our hunger. Once that was fixed we wandered toward the Palace to check it out. It was a beautiful structure that overlooked a larger central square.</p>
<p>We then wandered our way through a farmer’s/flea market that had beautiful flowers and food of every color. We continued to wander in the direction of the Jewish Quarter in Amsterdam and found the Jewish History Museum and one of the Portuguese synagogues. Then it was off to the famous red light district just to say that we had been there &#8211; it was interesting to say the least.</p>
<p> <strong>June 29</strong></p>
<p>Championship Day!!! Both of Israel’s festival teams were in the championship game today against Global Players. The men’s and women’s championship games were at the same time so unfortunately we couldn’t watch each other and cheer each other on, but it must have worked to the Israel Lacrosse program’s advantage because both teams won their respective tournaments!!</p>
<p>The men’s team won in regulation but we went into overtime. At first the refs told our coaches that there would be no overtime or decision and we would have to share the title (something that neither team wanted). To rectify this we went into a three-minute golden goal overtime, then if no one scored in those three minutes we would go into Braveheart to decide who won. For those of you who don’t know, Braveheart is a full-field one-v-one with goalies in cage.</p>
<p>Lucky for us, after having the ball in our defensive end we won it back and the baby of the team (Felissa) took a beautiful shot that went straight into the back of the net. At first I just stood on the field, not sure how to react (I was in shock), then I started running to the goalie (Liz) tearing up and the entire team ran together to celebrate.</p>
