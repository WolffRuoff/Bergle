								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Trust, G. (5 April 2011). ‘Glee’ cast, Matthew Morrison score first radio hit, thanks to original songs. <em>Billboard</em>. Retrieved from <a href="http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/industry/tv-film/glee-cast-matthew-morrison-score-first-1005113042.story">http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/industry/tv-film/glee-cast-matthew-morrison-score-first-1005113042.story</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://blogs.villagevoice.com/dailymusto/Glee-Cast-glee-9252428-600-429.jpg" alt="" width="241" height="173" />What’s the difference between <em>American Idol</em> and <em>Glee</em>? After all, both are television shows that promote the music industry. One difference is that, until now, Fox&#8217;s <em>Glee</em> wasn’t in the business of producing new artists. While some of the <em>Glee</em> cast’s covers have taken the Internet by storm and run quickly up the Billboard Top 100—<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds38BOOtGIQ"><em>Don’t Stop Believin’</em> may be the most famous</a>—they’re still just different versions of already-famous songs. All of that changed, however, with the recent release of the first song produced specifically for the show, called “Loser Like Me,” which has a critical advantage over all the covers: It’s getting radio airplay, premiering at #37 on the Nielson Adult Top 40.</p>
<p><span id="more-1082"></span></p>
<p>This, of course, is huge. The radio and sound recording industries have been connected at the hip since their mutual beginnings during the turn of last century. Radio is a critical facilitator for the music industry, introducing targeted demographics of consumers to new music; radio, in turn, relies on other media to supply fresh material for its listeners. Producers, for their part, are all too willing to do that. The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/26/business/26music.html?_r=1">desperation with which producers jockey for radio airtime</a> speaks to radio’s enduring importance to the music industry in the age of 200-channel television and iTunes. Increasingly these producers include the owners and creators of television shows like <em>Glee</em> who are hoping to run their content through another window.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The producers of <em>Glee</em>, like the labels that sign the <em>American Idol</em> winners, can opt out of this desperation because their artists are practically guaranteed airplay. <em>Glee</em>’s enormous popularity on television means that the cast’s music, which premieres on the show, is practically “pre-sold.” Radio program directors take huge risks when they add new music to their playlists, and they’re always looking for ways to reduce that risk. What better way to do that than to play music that’s already popular on other media, like television?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indeed, the <em>Glee</em> cast’s transition from mere facilitators pimping other artists’ music every week to producers releasing new material has been nearly seamless, with program directors scrambling to play the new music. The music fits perfectly with what the modern pop radio industry wants: It’s upbeat, unchallenging, and <a href="http://www.billboard.com/news/glee-returns-with-huge-ratings-win-1004115894.story#/news/glee-returns-with-huge-ratings-win-1004115894.story">already popular with that crucial 18-34-year old audience</a> (<em>Glee</em> consistently ranks #1 among that audience, teenagers in general, and teenage girls in particular, the equivalent of a royal flush for Fox). Interviews with program directors across the country confirm that sentiment, with one program director in Indiana lauding the new song’s ability to “resonate with kids and parents” and admitting that the new song’s origins in <em>Glee</em> give it a “leg up” in gaining airplay on her station.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <em>Glee</em> cast will soon promote their new music by going out on tour, with 22 scheduled appearances set to begin on June 22nd in Minneapolis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The success of <em>Glee</em>’s new music speaks to the power of a popular program to travel across media. With a variety of television shows either playing others’ music or facilitating the production of new music, the synergy between the two industries has never been stronger. Media industries like radio, sound recording, and television help each other reduce risk by mutually sharing popular content, which translates into stronger revenues for the large conglomerates that own most media companies today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whether that translates into more choice for consumers, however, is questionable. Public advocates continue to argue that the sharing of content across media, especially unchallenging content like the <em>Glee</em> music that appeals to the lowest common denominator, drowns out artists and voices with alternative views that may challenge the media conglomerates. Until popular music stops making money, however, the conglomerates are likely to continue to encourage this type of cross-promotion of content into the future.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Herrera, M. (31 January 2011). Eminem to star in Super Bowl claymation ad: Report.  <em>Billboard</em>.  Retrieved from <a href="http://www.billboard.com/search/?keyword=eminem#/news/eminem-to-star-in-super-bowl-claymation-1005016312.story">http://www.billboard.com/search/?keyword=eminem#/news/eminem-to-star-in-super-bowl-claymation-1005016312.story</a></p>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://imagecache.blastro.com/images/feat/eminem.jpg" alt="" width="181" height="113" /></p>
<p>Lipton Brisk Iced Tea has a treat for Super Bowl ad enthusiasts this year: Eminem in Claymation! The rapper allegedly landed an appearance in Lipton’s $1 million ad spot, set to air during the February 6th game, which features a clay version of him going through “a day in the life” of a superstar. The Claymation theme harks back to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-g8opm1ZmY&amp;playnext=1&amp;list=PL3AEE3D248A17A481">a classic Lipton ad campaign that once featured Frank Sinatra</a>.</p>
<p><span id="more-719"></span></p>
<p>Eminem’s participation in the ad reveals the continuing attempts at synergy between the sound recording industry and the television advertising departments of major companies like Lipton. It especially represents the sound recording industry’s attempt to nab its own piece of the Super Bowl revenue pie. Advertisers realized long ago that the Super Bowl’s ability to reach multiple demographics—a rare ability indeed in this era of fragmented cable audiences—makes the mega-million-dollar ad spaces worth the price. The sound recording industry, in turn, can exploit the advertisers’ need for celebrity endorsements to give their ads that extra pizazz. Clay Eminem drinks some clay tea for Lipton and Lipton gets Eminem (and his new album) in front of the 18-34 audience. Everyone wins. This has been going on since (and long before) <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8qtsUaoVak&amp;feature=related">Madonna teamed up with Pepsi during the 1980s to release her “Like a Prayer” video</a>. The fact that everyone remembers that ad testifies to the strategy’s potential.</p>
<p>Lurking somewhere behind all these joint sound recording-television ventures is a person or persons who are serving what Turow would call “linking pin” roles. These are the people who try to “link” someone or something from one medium (in this case, sound recording) to another (in this case, television). Since Eminem owns his own record label, he’s almost certainly in full promo mode for his new album, <em>Relapse</em>, through traditional sound recording channels like radio and new ones like iTunes. However, the Super Bowl ad offers a vastly expanded audience and possibly access to new TV-watching fans. In the new Information Age, artists who <em>don’t</em> venture into media outside of their industries are already behind.</p>
<p>Indeed, Eminem’s “linking pins” (which may include himself) have been hard at work even outside of preparing a Super Bowl ad appearance. In addition to television, he’s apparently eying a film role in an upcoming DreamWorks picture.</p>
<p>Why all this branching out in the music industry? While recording artists are no strangers to working within the television and film worlds, some of the recent expansion into other media may reflect concerns about illegal downloading. New file sharing outfits seem to pop up faster than the record labels can file lawsuits against them. The possibility of decreasing profit potential within the traditional sound recording industry may motivate artists like Eminem to explore work in other media industries and to seek new advertising opportunities.</p>
<p>Only time will tell how successful these explorations will be for the future of the sound recording industry.</p>
