								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s bizarre to think of the world without the internet. Society has become so accustomed to the use of it, that it is odd to think that there once was a time that it did not exist. The initial use of technology has now become so prevalent in the work force, that everyone often forgets that not too long ago, it was not available at the tough of your finger tips. You could not just email a presentation to your boss or type up word documents and spreadsheets. These new perks all made their appearance in the late 80s and 90s after the internet was first conceived. Patricia Wallace, the author of <i>The Internet In The Workplace</i>, refers to the internet as a ‘desktop gateway to the world.’ She explains,“It changed the context of work, the context of business in general, and the context of entire industries” (Wallace, 2004, p. 2).</p>
<p>The birth of the internet did indeed create a whole new dynamic of the work place with the help of these new technologies. Patricia discusses how the use of the internet helps assist companies in many ways, the most being the 24/7 access. It’s now possible for an employee to work even when they are not physically sitting in their office. All aspects of a company can be accessed from the outside. Other employees can be contacted, work can be done, and information can be sent to different people. It is also much easier for training new employees. It prevents you from having to waste both time and money. This new learning, e-learning, makes it much easier for both companies and future employees.</p>
<p>Technology has infiltrated the work force, and it is overall for the better. The workplace endured a technological revolution that is increasingly improved it. Some may ask whether that is a positive or negative. Why would it be a negative? It has brought many great aspects to the workforce that were did not exist many year ago.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Facebook is just another one of the countless forms of social media that my generation uses to see what their “friends” are doing. One’s news feed is the endless list that updates itself as people upload new content. These news feeds encompass status updates, pictures, and even articles that people like and share. The problem with Facebook occurs when users accept friend requests from people they don&#8217;t actually know. Now these strangers have access to not only personal pictures, but personal information.</p>
<p>Robert Lemieux, a professor in the communication department at McDaniel College, conducted a study about privacy on Facebook. His participants had to construct a fictitious profile with the name Jamie Marple and a profile picture showing both a girl and a boy. The name Jamie was chosen because of the possibility that it could fit either gender. The only other information on the profile aside from the name and the extremely vague picture, was “Jamie’s” date of birth and hometown. “Since the study’s primary interest was to test the likelihood of being accepted as a friend based on limited, personal information, Jamie’s personal information was severely limited” (Lemieux, 2012). Another group of participants within the study were informed to friend Jamie and write on her profile. This made it look like Jamie was real and active user.</p>
<p>The entire purpose of Lemieux’s study was to see if people would accept a friend request from a person with a questionable profile that they really did not know. The results proved that kids are willing to accept friend requests from even the profiles that have meager amounts of information. “Results indicated that 325 Facebook members (72% of the sample) willingly accepted the friendship of the unknown individual” (Lemieux, 2012). More than 50% of Facebook users were willing to welcome a new friendship despite knowing such a minute amount of information about them.</p>
<p>What’s the issue with this? Why is it so bad to casually accept a friend request on Facebook? You see that you have some mutual friends with this persons so it must not be a big deal. Many problems however could come along with the spontaneous action of accepting anyone and everyone. Not only is your privacy in jeopardy, but your security is too. Once accepting that friend request, the person on the other side of the computer has access to very personal information like where you live or where you go to school. They can also see pictures that you post, and pictures other people post of you. One day someone unwanted could find out where you live or the wrong person could see you at a party holding a beer. Would you want that?</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A selfie,“A self portrait photograph, typically taken with a digital camera or a camera phone held by the hand or supported by a selfie stick” (Selfie, 2015). All people, whether they want to admit it or not, have taken a selfie at one point in their life. It may have been for their followers on Instagram, or maybe to their best friend on Snapchat. Regardless of the recipient or the purpose, the selfie was still taken.</p>
<p>The world may think the selfie was introduced only a few years ago, but in reality the concept is ancient. The first selfie was technically taken in 1839 by famous photographer, Robert Cornelius. He used the first photographic process, known as daguerreotypy. This process however was much different from the selfie today. The photographer figured out that the process was so slow that he could start the camera, enter the frame, and then exit the frame (Selfie, 2015). Essentially, he was able to take a self portrait by himself. As time went on, the selfie continued to evolve. “The debut of the portable Kodak brownie box camera in 1900 led to photographic self portrait  becoming a more widespread technique” (Selfie, 2015). The photographer would position themselves in front of a mirror to capture their self portrait.</p>
<p>The selfie that we have grown to know started off as the typical Myspace picture. &#8220;An amateurish, flash-blinded self-portrait, often taken in front of a bathroom mirror” (Selfie, 2015). However these mirror pictures didn’t last forever. Once Facebook began overshadowing Myspace, the concept had morphed once again. User’s selfies were becoming more classy and well planned out. Digital cameras and camera phones were now obsolete due to the new technologies that housed front facing cameras.</p>
<p>Selfies were taken to a whole new level. They started out as just a profile picture on a social media site and evolved into a daily act for a lot of people. Well planned selfies are taken to get on likes on Instagram, ugly selfies are taken to send to friends on Snapchat, and group selfies are taken to capture memories. In just a few short years, the idea of the selfie we knew exploded. “The popularity of selfies in social media has been astounding. Instagram has over 53 million photos tagged with the hashtag #selfie. The word ‘selfie’ was mentioned in Facebook status updates over 368,000 times during a one-week period in October 2013. During the same period on Twitter, the hashtag #selfie was used in more than 150,000 tweets” (Selfie, 2015).</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What is the first thing that comes to mind when you think of Instagram? My mind is immediately flooded with selfies, pictures of dogs, and even last nights dinner. The social platform allows people to freely post pictures and anyone that follows them can see it. Harmless right? The world of Instagram <i>was</i>, up until a much younger generation got ahold of it.</p>
<p>The article I found, <i>Lesson Learned: Kids and Instagram</i> is written by Wendi Aarons, a mother who describes her experience of allowing her eleven year old son to get an Instagram. When her son first downloaded the app, it looked the same as any other kids’. He began following his classmates from school, star athletes he looked up to, and post pictures of the family cat. It was the epitome of what an eleven year old’s Instagram should look like. However this photo sharing app is not made for children. They do not fully understand its purpose, and this mom quickly realized it. When Wendi proceeded to check up on his account, she found many things that were pretty alarming. First she came across the name of the school her son attended written in his bio, which she thought was alarming until she read the bio’s on the Instagram accounts of his friends. So many depicted their new relationship status. Wendi expressed,“Kids who I remember peeing their pants in Kindergarten now describe themselves online as “Taken!!” or ‘Single and Wants to Mingle!’…It was shocking because I had absolutely no idea that 10 and 11 year-old kids were already ‘dating’” (Aarons). Girls were beginning to make comments on boy’s photos complimenting them on how ‘hot they are’ and how much they ‘like them.’ Wendi finally stumbled upon something that left her in disbelief. An account was made about a girl that her son went to school with. The whole profile was making fun of how ugly this ten year old was.</p>
<p>Instagram, a photo sharing app, is used by children in a whole different way than its meant for. Instead of just editing and posting pictures and videos, children put themselves in dangerous positions by revealing personal information about themselves. They also come in contact with people they don’t even know, who could potentially harm them. Technology and social media like Instagram are putting the young generation into a whole new perspective. How long can we keep them safe?</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Think about how many times a day you read. From the moment you wake up, you are reading everything from street signs to text messages, from newspapers to billboards. People constantly complain about having to read, despite the fact that reading is extremely crucial to our existence. If no one was able to read, it would be very hard to function in society. Mike Hanksi informs us just how important reading is in his article <i>Want to Be a Better Writer? Read More.</i> Within his opening he states,“Reading is fashionable. Again. It’s cool. We bet you can all find many statements about how good and useful reading is, how much it can influence a person and his way of thinking… ” (Hanski, 2014).</p>
<p>If someone explained to you exactly how to be a great writer, would you listen? If they laid everything out, would you follow through? Hanski does just this. He depicts the sole way to becoming a successful writer is by reading. By doing this, one will become more educated and discover inspiration. Ideas obtained through reading will only increase your ability when writing. Reading can make your brain function stronger; it exercises your mind and circulates blood flow to the brain. From there it continues with reducing the likelihood of contracting Alzheimer’s disease and even makes a person more sympathetic. The benefits of reading are endless, so why would one not take that chance and run with it. It’s a no brainer to utilize reading as a tool to just make your writing exceptional and to improve your quality of life.  Mike quotes famous author Stephen King,“ If you don’t have the time to read, you don’t have the time (or the tools) to write. Simple as that” (Hanski, 2014). Even a well renowned, published author agrees with Hanski that reading is quite an essential aspect of being a great writer.</p>
