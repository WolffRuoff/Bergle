								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The motives found for posting on Instagram are surveillance/knowledge about others, documentation, and coolness. According to &#8220;Instagram: Motives for its use and relationship to narcissism and contextual age&#8221;, of the motives “Surveillance/Knowledge about others” was the most influential reason behind Instagram use&#8221; (Sheldon and Bryant). I myself use Instagram often for knowledge about others and have noticed that my peers also do. I catch myself scrolling aimlessly just to keep updated and see what&#8217;s up with the people I follow on my account. Or I can even keep up with strangers that are not private and I go to the explore page. I can see what they are doing/have done.</p>
<p>The knowledge about others also included the following and &#8220;liking&#8221; of people&#8217;s posts. Several facts about someone can be figured out through their Instagram. This information ranges from someones economic status, relationship status, the amount of friends they have, and along with that who their closest friends are, etc. My friends and I all post a lot on Instagram and a lot about us can be discovered due to what we post. This information is only viewed by our followers, but if someone is not private, anyone can follow them or just view their posts without following them. that means complete strangers form the other side of the world can see what they have been doing in their life.</p>
<p>The next motive was &#8220;Documentation&#8221;. The authors write, &#8220;The reasoning behind Documentation surfacing as a potential motive in this study is likely due to the characteristics of Instagram that set it apart from other social media forums. For instance, Instagram primarily focuses on images or pictures whereas Twitter is a more text-based forum&#8221; (Sheldon and Bryant). People like to document their lives through photos, which makes it more likely for them to post a photo to Instagram rather than composing a tweet. Another good point mentioned in this article is that &#8220;Instagram allows users to provide both a picture and text as there is an option to provide a caption underneath the image. In this way, Instagram acts as a kind of virtual photo album for many people&#8221; (Sheldon and Bryant).</p>
<p>Lastly, there is &#8220;Coolness&#8221;. When it comes to social media people usually want to be on one that is popular among their peers. There are also &#8220;cool&#8221; features on Instagram like filters, links to things that are trending, and ways to explore. Along with these cool features people like to use this social media because of self-promotion and to become more popular. Everyone wants to get a lot of &#8220;likes&#8221; on their photos to show that they are cool and popular.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are constantly being watched on the internet. There is no privacy, no matter how tight we think the security on our social media pages are. The notion of social media sites being ‘free,’ is a scam, because although they may not take our money, they take our privacy. These sites, such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Gmail all advertise the fact that users can sign up and use their services for no cost; that ‘cost’ meaning money. The real cost of using these free sites is that they have access to view everything we do while using their product. These services will track what we search, and use it as a way to advertise products to us, knowing that we will be interested in the advertisements because of our internet search history. For example, if I were to purchase clothes online, the items that I view online would appear as advertisements on my Facebook news feed; I do not think that is such a coincidence. Jim Groom helped dissect the messages that we see every day in media. He explained the concept of DOOM (Domain of One’s Own), and shared that although we may be in charge of our individual social media pages, there are other people who own our domain as well.</p>
<p>In George Orwell’s <em>1984</em>, the story focuses on the idea that ‘Big Brother’ is always watching and listening to every small detail of every person’s life. That idea was thought to be crazy, before Edward Snowden released thousands of documents revealing that the government was tracking every small detail of every person’s life, just as ‘Big Brother’ had done in <em>1984</em>. As scary of a thought it is to think that the government and sites such as Google and Facebook know almost everything about us, the truth is, we bring it upon ourselves. When we sign up for media sites, we tend to enter a lot of personal information. It is frightening, but all of our personal information is on the internet, whether we like it or not. We have essentially given ‘Big Brother’ every small detail about our lives just through social media. Pun intended, we are all DOOMed.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Social media is a major part of my life. Quite frankly, I can&#8217;t remember the last time I&#8217;ve gone a full day without using social media. Social media gives me this sense of power and control because it allows me to show off my profile to the public. Though it isn&#8217;t a palpable object, social media almost feels like a possession, despite the fact that I share it with millions of people. It feels like my own possession because I have control over the people I follow, the posts that I like, and more. After this week&#8217;s discussion with Jim Groom, as well as the assigned reading, I&#8217;m starting to second guess the amount of trust I put into social media. Not only that, but I&#8217;m beginning to realize that the companies of social media profit from us using social media just as much as we do.</p>
<p><em>The best things in life are free?</em> Think again. According to Jim Groom, any website or app that is free entails that there is no privacy. This is a tactic of the social media companies because it attracts more people to sign up since there&#8217;s no cost. But it turns out that this is a loophole: the cost is your personal privacy. The more you use social media, the more of your &#8220;history&#8221; it records. On apps such as Instagram, nobody really knows who exactly controls your history. Though it is concerning that private and important information can be controlled by social media companies, many users (including myself) continue to take a risk and trust these companies.</p>
<p>These companies also manipulate us by making us think that they are providing for us, but in reality we are providing for them. According to Audrey Watters, &#8220;our content and our data, shared publicly, become theirs to profit from” (Watters 2016). In her article, Watters discusses how us users are the ones working for social media companies. This strikes me because when I sign up for a social media account, I don&#8217;t sign up to work for them&#8230;I sign up for them to work for me.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;d be lying if I said I don&#8217;t care about how many likes my Instagram posts get. If I don&#8217;t get as many likes as I expected for a post, a part of me feels disappointed. There&#8217;s something about getting a lot of likes that is so fulfilling and satisfying. When I first got an Instagram, I was always jealous of people who got more likes than me. I was so desperate at one point, that I used #likesforlikes to get strangers to like my posts. Why must we be in this preconceived notion that we are defined by numbers?</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not against social sharing, I&#8217;m against the current status of social media.&#8221; -Essena O&#8217;Neill, a 19-year-old from Australia (BuzzFeedBlue 2015). From a glimpse at her Instagram, O&#8217;Neill looks like she has it all. Not only is she gorgeous and has a small figure, but she has over half a million followers on Instagram and gets thousands of likes. Who wouldn&#8217;t want to be like that? Well it turns out that her &#8220;perfect&#8221; life isn&#8217;t as perfect as it seems. Because she got so Instagram-famous, O&#8217;Neill felt this pressure to continue posting picture-perfect posts of herself. She became miserable because &#8220;she became addicted to the approval of her appearance&#8221;, and the only thing that made her feel better was getting more likes and followers (BuzzFeedBlue 2015). As a result, O&#8217;Neill changed the captions of her pictures to expose how these &#8220;candid&#8221; pictures were staged so that she would look her absolute best.</p>
<p>I feel that even though we live in an era of technological advancements, we should all take a step back and look at what is truly important. Family, friends, health, equality&#8230;values in life that can&#8217;t be defined by numbers. It is up to us social media users to get out of this habit of caring about likes and start caring about things that are authentic.</p>
