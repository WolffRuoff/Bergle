								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This infographic explains the makeup  of the Instagram audience and their uses of this platform through numerical values. The most Instagram users are from urban settings (42%).  (Hutchinson, 2016)</span> <span style="font-weight: 400">This correlates with the idea that wealthier people use the app more. For example, only 26% of users make an annual income of less than $30,000 ;however, 30% of users have an income between $50,000 and $74,000. (Hutchinson, 2016) Living in a more urban setting is more expensive. From personal experience, Instagram is a difficult social media because it is all about having the perfect picture to get the most likes. One needs to make sure they are consistently posting  on their feed so they please their followers. Living in a more urban setting with some more money makes it easier for people to take pictures of their dinners when they go out to eat or a picture of their friends on their shopping excursion. People feel the need to show off their lives and make it more glamorous to their followers. Looking at the idea of filters and photoshop, one can see that followers can easily be alluded by a post. A mediocre selfie can turn into a work of art with a simple filter. When talking about having a fake identity in class discussions, most students said they don&#8217;t post inauthentic stuff but they don&#8217;t post the ugly or bad pictures. Only showing 50% of your life is inauthentic because from the viewer&#8217;s perspective, your life is perfect.  800 million posts are tagged with love, showing people&#8217;s’ needs to present their best sides and their amazing love life. (Hutchinson, 2016) Although relationships are difficult, followers are only subject to the fun outings and memorable couple moments. Therefore, Instagram often falsely shows a life of fun and luxury. Overall this infographic does a good job using numbers to show how Instagram is an app used for appeal and attention. However it doesn&#8217;t show the entire picture. Who was polled and how do we know these statistics aren&#8217;t biased in any way? </span></p>
