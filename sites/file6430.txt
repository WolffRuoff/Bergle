								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How I feel as family weekend comes to a close is simple:</p>
<p><strong>bitter-sweet:</strong> Seeing my mom, dad, and sister reminded me how much I love and missed them. I have told myself numerous times that I am comfortable being alone across the country, and I still am, but the presence of my family touched on a soft spot in my heart.</p>
<p>In a short 48 hours, the four of us went out to two fancy dinners, ate two Muhlen-meals (amazing as always), went to the farmers market, walked around the scenic Dorney Park, and much more. Every moment was cherished as we laughed and caught up. It was just where we left off.</p>
<p>Now, four weeks lay ahead until we are reunited again. Next time though, I am the one traveling back to the other coast. That gives me plenty of time to accumulate stories to share over thanksgiving table.</p>
<p>Happy trails,<br />
Jake</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Having your parents visit you in college incites a variety of unique emotions- none of which really relate to each other.</p>
<p><strong>nostalgia- </strong> After not seeing the people that have loved me unconditionally, raised me, provided selflessly for me and simply lived with me for my entire life, I miss them. My family means the world to me, and at time it has been difficult being almost three thousand miles away with a three-hour time change. Them coming here is already bringing back so many great feelings and memories.</p>
<p><strong>confusion-</strong> I have done a fair share of traveling in my day, and so have both my parents; however, nothing in my prior experience has been of this sort. Usually, I leave the house, and return to my house, or, one of them will leave the house and return to my house. Now, they are leaving my &#8220;old home&#8221; and traveling to my &#8220;new home,&#8221; then returning to my old home. I am not sure if that makes perfect sense, but in context it is leaving me very confused. Since when did I have two homes? Ahhh!</p>
<p><strong>excitement- </strong>Talking on the phone or texting can never fill the void of not seeing the people you love dearly. I can&#8217;t wait to show my parents and my sister what life has been like the last two months on my own. I want to show off all my favorite parts of campus so they know everything is great here.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re on the way now! Counting down&#8230;</p>
