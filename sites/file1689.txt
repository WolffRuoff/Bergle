We are not alone. Shakespeare-related books are so numerous that librarians decided to assigned these books their very own Dewey classification number, 822.33. To create order among rows and rows of books numbered 822.33, librarians also gave Shakespeare books their own Cuttering  system (the part of the call number that begins with letters). &nbsp;The  Cuttering system for Shakespeare allows us to group together books with  something in common, for example, all books about Shakespeare that are  criticism can be given the Cutter A3 (general criticism &#8211;  822.33 A3 )  or A4 (specific subjects &#8211;  822.33 A4 ).<br> <br>However depending on your collection there can be many  different subjects   <em>within <\/em>A4.  In our case, all of the different subjects of criticism  were  intermixed across nine shelves of A4, which makes browsing for a   specific topic difficult. Our cataloger took organization of Shakespeare  Criticism to the next available level of classification. The cataloger  expanded A4 to identify and group specific subjects in Shakespeare  Criticism as follows:   <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A41&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Authorship<br> A42&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Relationships \/ Gender \/ sexuality \/ race  <br> A43&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Language \/ imagery <br> A44&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Politics \/ Law \/ Economics  <br> A45&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Psychology \/ philosophy <br> A46&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Religion <br> A47&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stage Production \/ performance \/acting techniques, for example, <br>                     Diction \/ speech Dramatics \/ characterization \/ staging<br> A48&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Relationship to other Arts, for example, Film, Music, Painting<br> A49&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [not used]<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of these books also have a second Cutter number which puts the books in order by author or title. You may have noticed that with other books the Cutter is based on the author or title.  Here is an example of the double Cutter:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>822.33 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Shakespeare without women : representing gender and race&#8230;<\/strong> <br>A42             by Callaghan, Dympna.<br>C156s<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The additional Cuttering used for Shakespeare at Trexler Library extends beyond A3 and A4 to the full alphabet as shown in the table below. You will notice that A8 (shown as A81-A89) is also broken down.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img data-attachment-id=\"2469\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/trexlerworks.muhlenberg.edu\/trexler_blog\/news\/infomaniac-shakespeare-at-trexler-library-beyond-822-33\/attachment\/image\/#main\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/trexlerworks.muhlenberg.edu\/trexler_blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/image.png?fit=439%2C208\" data-orig-size=\"439,208\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"image\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/trexlerworks.muhlenberg.edu\/trexler_blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/image.png?fit=300%2C142\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/trexlerworks.muhlenberg.edu\/trexler_blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/image.png?fit=439%2C208\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"439\" height=\"208\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/trexlerworks.muhlenberg.edu\/trexler_blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/image.png?resize=439%2C208\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2469\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/trexlerworks.muhlenberg.edu\/trexler_blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/image.png?w=439 439w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/trexlerworks.muhlenberg.edu\/trexler_blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/image.png?resize=300%2C142 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 439px) 100vw, 439px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p> If you have questions or would like assistance finding Shakespeare materials or any library resource, please <a href=\"http:\/\/trexler.muhlenberg.edu\/research\/ask-a-librarian.html\">contact us<\/a> by email,  phone,  or in-person.  <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Infomaniac is a monthly column featuring new tools or tips related to using and finding information.
