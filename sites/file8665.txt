<p>Szulman went a perfect 3-0 in singles play without dropping a set and added a doubles win for the Mules. The sophomore only dropped three games at No. 2 singles to help the Mules pick up their first CC win over Bryn Mawr on Friday. Szulman followed that up with a dominating 6-4, 6-0 singles win at Gettysburg on Saturday.</p>

<p>Rosen batted .500 with six runs scored, four RBI, two doubles and a triple in four games for the Mules. The sophomore also walked once and was hit once for a .571 on-base percentage. Rosen, who had an RBI in every game he played during the week, reached base five times, stole his first career base and scored four runs in the 16-3 win over Albright on Thursday.</p>

<p><strong>What’s it mean to you to be the leading scorer in Mule basketball history? </strong>Becoming the leading scorer in Mule basketball history has been a tremendous honor and certainly one of my favorite achievements of my college career. I’ve worked tirelessly throughout my four years to be the best player I could be, but my efforts would be wasted if I was not blessed with such amazing teammates.</p>
<p><strong>How did you become such a great shooter? </strong>I developed my shooting prowess like any other great shooter; hard work, persistence, repetition, dedication and some more hard work. When I was growing up, I would shoot 1,000 shots a day and wouldn’t rest until I had made 100 free throws. I’m not sure I can claim the same today, but that’s why you put in the work early!</p>
<p><strong>What’s it like having a father that played at Duke? </strong>Having a father like mine, regardless of whether he played at Duke, has been such a blessing. My Dad has always been there for me as a coach, rebounder, my biggest fan (tied with my mother, whom I love dearly) and anything I’ve needed to be successful. Being a star at Duke does have its perks though. We usually go to a game at Cameron Indoor Stadium once a year, and he seems to know everyone there! I’ve even met Coach K. That was beyond cool!</p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans? </strong>I’m hoping to play basketball professionally in Europe somewhere for a year since I was never able to study abroad. I really love to travel, and I think it will be a good experience for me to be out on my own for a little while. When I return to United States, I will seek admission to law school in either Maryland or California and begin my path towards becoming a lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>What’s Katy Rossino like off the court? </strong>Wow, where to begin. When Katy is not collecting chapstick, she is meticulously grooming her financial savings. When she’s not doing that, she’s pulling a prank on someone; so watch out … Jokes aside, Katy is just as amazing off the court as she is on it. Brilliant, hardworking and my best friend.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/muihs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-980" title="Kimberly Mui" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/muihs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Kimberly Mui</strong></p>
<p><strong>How great did it feel to be able to step back on the court this season? </strong>When I tore my ACL last summer, the hardest thing to comprehend was the fact that I would not be able to be on the court and play with my friends that season. Being able to step back on the court this season was an incredible and indescribable feeling. I have a great passion for basketball, so stepping back on the court with my teammates was amazing, and I’m lucky to have had a successful surgery to be able to play again in my senior year.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s the key to playing tough defense?</strong> Defense has always been my main focus in basketball. I’m a true believer in the saying “Defense wins championships.” I also believe that with good defense comes good offense. I think one of the keys to playing tough defense is to always keep your feet moving and stay lower than your opponent. Being fast and quick also doesn’t hurt 🙂</p>
<p><strong>How many different ways have you heard your name mispronounced? </strong>Over my life, I’ve heard ridiculous mispronunciations of my name. It spans from Moo, Moo-i, Moo-ey, Mwee, to My. I think my favorite is Moo-ey because a lot of people call me that and yell out that name. Also, Moo-ey seems to flow off the tongue. Mew is a funny one too because my freshman year, all the senior basketball players used to call me “Kim Mew for Two.”</p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans? </strong>I’m not exactly sure yet because I still have to send my resume to companies and go on interviews, but I would love to work at a marketing firm somewhere in New York. My dream is to work in the sports industry, like being on the marketing team for the New York Yankees.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s Kathleen Naddaff like off the court? </strong>Kathleen is probably the weirdest person you will ever meet. After living with her this year, I realized that she likes to make weird noises and scream randomly. All kidding aside, Kathleen is one of the most genuine and sweetest people I know. She would do anything for her family, friends and teammates, and that is one of the many things I admire about her. <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/12/naddaffhs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-628" title="Kathleen Naddaff" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/12/naddaffhs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Kathleen Naddaff</strong></p>
<p><strong>How would you describe your style of play? </strong>I am definitely a lot more defensive-minded when it comes to my style of play, and I know my role on the team is not to be a leading scorer, but to help the team win with rebounding, boxing out, screening and playing defense. I definitely would say I play to try and make the team better, and I don’t worry about my stats. <em></em></p>
<p><strong>How have you improved since your freshman season? </strong>During my freshman year I was nervous, scared and very hesitant. I looked at all of the teams and thought they were much more experienced than I was, so that intimidated me. I can remember the first game of the Scotty Wood Tournament my freshman year, I literally thought I was going to throw up I was so nervous. Now I go out on the floor with the mindset that no one can guard me or get by me if I tell myself they won’t. I have prided myself on my defense, and if I just concentrate on that and get a few great stops, my offense will come. I am a lot more confident walking out on the court because I have done it many times before.</p>
<p><strong>What’s it like having a father that was drafted by the Indiana Pacers?</strong> I am so proud of my dad, and I look up to him a lot. He and my mom have been such amazing role models in my life. Yes, my father’s shoes are very hard to fill (quite literally), but I know that he has been through a lot and knows the game of basketball. So I really do look up to him and respect everything he has to say.</p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans? </strong>I actually have two job offers right now, with a few more interviews lined up. The job offers are at BE Furniture and BFI Furniture. They are corporate furniture companies in Parsippany, N.J., where I would function as a project manager. I am looking to stay close so I can live at home for a few more years. Mom and Dad are going to love it 🙂<em></em></p>
<p><strong>What kind of teammate is Kimberly Mui? </strong>Kim is not only an amazing teammate, but she is also one of my roommates. Kim really makes me want to be a better teammate, because regardless of what happens, she is there for this team with a smile and encouraging words. I seriously give her all the credit in the world for what she went through last year and how supportive she was throughout the entire year for the team. Kim will cheer every single girl on, and she honestly is not just an amazing teammate but also a great friend.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/rossinohs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-981" title="Katy Rossino" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/rossinohs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Katy Rossino</strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s it feel like knowing you’re in control of the offense as a point guard? </strong>I love being a point guard. There was a time at the beginning of the season when I was nervous about it. To know that I was in control of the offense was a scary thing for me, especially since I hadn’t had that opportunity to see significant minutes since high school. I’ve become a much more vocal player, and have learned so much about each player on our team – where to get them the ball, how they are going to come off a screen, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Have you always been so hesitant to shoot? </strong>I’ve never been one to take 20 shots in a game, but I did shoot more in high school. I’ve always tried to do what I need to help the team. My role has always been to be more of a passer, a provider of comedic relief and, most importantly, a role model to the younger girls. They really look up to me as a mature, inspirational and “larger than life” figure.</p>
<p><strong>What off-the-court accomplishment are you most proud of? </strong>I’m very proud of my work with the Academic Resource Center. I’ve been a tutor all four years at Muhlenberg and have tutored about 25 students in math, finance and accounting classes. I enjoy tutoring because it is an extremely rewarding experience. It’s always great to know that I helped someone succeed in a class. I’ve learned a lot about how to adjust to different learning styles, which is a skill I have been able to use at various financal and accounting internships and plan to use in the future when I start working.</p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans? </strong>Next October I will begin working as an auditor at Deloitte &amp; Touche, a big four public accounting firm, in Boston. I’ll spend the summer studying for the CPA exam and hope to pass all four sections by my start date. Then I hope to transition into my dream job, which is winning the lottery and moving to Europe, where my only responsibilities will be eating and sleeping. <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What kind of person is Alexandra Chili? </strong>Where do I begin? Chili has been my best friend at Muhlenberg since we were freshmen. We spend way too much time together playing basketball, becoming the dominating duo in team ping-pong tournaments, saying “Hey, what’s up” to all the wrong people, and everything in between. She has an extraordinary personality and can make anyone laugh to the point of tears. Sometimes we laugh so much we cry, and then the next morning we have no idea what we laughed about. She’s an unbelievable basketball player, student and friend. I’ve already promised her that I’ll name my first child “Alexander Chilington,” which has been my nickname for her.</p>

			<p><em><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/Special-Olympics.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-968" title="Special Olympics - Division III" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/Special-Olympics.jpg" alt="" width="220" height="238" /></a>NCAA Division III is engaged in a partnership with Special Olympics this year. According to the NCAA Website, the purpose of the partnership is to improve the lives of Special Olympics athletes through their involvement with Division III student-athletes and to foster a mutual learning experience between Division III student-athletes and Special Olympics athletes.</em></p>
<p><em>On Saturday, four Mule athletes representing four sports (field hockey, volleyball, basketball and softball) and field hockey coach Megan Eddinger paticipated in a Special Olympics event. Junior Devon Barber filed this report:</em></p>
<p>Most people would argue that beautiful Saturdays aren’t meant to be spent inside &#8211; except the members of the Student-Athlete Advisory Committee who spent a great St. Patrick’s Day afternoon at Jordan Lanes for the Special Olympics Lehigh County Bowling Event.</p>
<p>Coach Eddinger, Brittany Blohm, Kate Clawson, Erica Wenzel and I all hopped in a mini-van behind Martin Luther Saturday morning to head over to the alley. After a much-needed stop at Dunkin Donuts, we arrived to find that we missed a memo. We were all dressed in <a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/SpecialOlympics3.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-969" title="Special Olympics" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/SpecialOlympics3.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="245" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/SpecialOlympics3.jpg 350w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/SpecialOlympics3-300x210.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" /></a>Muhlenberg t-shirts, but many of the athletes were dressed in St. Patrick’s Day attire. One of the staff members even had a green beard! Still, we were welcomed with open arms by the staff, athletes and the local Girl Scouts who were helping out as well.</p>
<p>The staff seemed stressed from the beginning and we were a bit nervous. The reason behind this tension was because there were 96 bowlers that we had to keep track of! Bowlers were either playing individually against other bowlers in the same lane, or there were two teams that were competing against each other in opposing lanes. It was handled pretty smoothly, though, as the competition started at 1:00 on the dot.</p>
<p>The national anthem was played after the reciting of the Special Olympics Oath:</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Let me win, but if I cannot win, let me be brave in the attempt.”</strong></p>
<p>It was pretty powerful to hear all of the athletes say this oath before they began bowling. It represented a lot of what Special Olympics Lehigh County is about, where their philosophy asserts the athletic spirit of courage and joy, as well as giving those with disabilities the opportunity to share their skills and friendship with the community as a whole. Special Olympics Lehigh County provides year-round sports competitions, such as for basketball, gymnastics, track and field and more, for adults and children of a variety of ages. For this event specifically, the bowling winners had the chance to advance to different competitions, so it was safe to say that the contest was fierce from the get-go.</p>
<p>Coach and Kate were assigned to keep score for the lanes that had a battle between two teams. Erica, Brittany and I were placed on reward duty, so we got the chance to sit back and watch a couple games before we had to turn on our math brains to add up the scores.</p>
<p>The bowlers were allowed to practice a bit before the scoring started. We were a little confused to see how even though they were on different teams, they switched back and forth to each other’s lanes between turns. I could see Coach starting to get uncomfortable because we all didn’t really know what was going on. Coach asked one of the bowlers, Christina, to explain the switching of lanes. She claimed that this is what they have been doing for weeks, so they knew that what they were doing was correct.</p>
<p>Christina went on to explain how the bowling event that we attended was actually the end of an eight-week series, where bowlers competed every weekend since sometime in January. Bowlers that were at this event were allowed to compete to move onto the next competition if they were present at at least five of the eight weekend events. With this being said, the athletes took control, and quickly moved from the practice round onto their competing games.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/SpecialOlympics4.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-970" title="Special Olympics" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/SpecialOlympics4.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="264" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/SpecialOlympics4.jpg 400w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/SpecialOlympics4-300x198.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></a>It was fun to walk back and forth between games to see how well they were doing. One of the bowlers, David, was angry about one of his scores, 130-something mind you, which is way higher than I would ever get personally. I told him I celebrate when I break 100 and he laughed at me.</p>
<p>It was certain that these athletes were in it to win it, although the more serious bowlers were also balanced with those who were there just to have a good time. It showed because they were the ones that were making jokes with us and taking pictures with us. <a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/SpecialOlympics2.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-971" title="Special Olympics" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/SpecialOlympics2.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/SpecialOlympics2.jpg 400w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/SpecialOlympics2-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></a>Kate especially looked like she was having a great time, as she was surrounded by two teams of all happy-go-lucky bowlers. All in all, it was fun to take photos, laugh, and just watch and learn as they racked up impressive scores.</p>
<p>At the end, Erica, Brittany and I were in charge of adding up the scores and distributing the ribbons. I think Erica would agree when I write thank goodness for calculators! The scores were added and a ribbon was presented to each bowler representing first, second, third or fourth place, with their names and individual scores written on the back.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/SpecialOlympics1.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-972" title="Special Olympics" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/SpecialOlympics1.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/SpecialOlympics1.jpg 400w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/SpecialOlympics1-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></a>It was an amazing feeling to see how excited they were to receive their ribbons from Brittany for any place that they got. It really allowed me to think back about why I started playing sports in the first place: for the happiness I feel because of it.</p>
<p>Kate Clawson said, “Overall, the experience at the Special Olympics bowling event this Saturday was very rewarding. Interacting with the athletes was awesome. They were all such great sports and that’s something I really admired about them, as they admired us for volunteering our time.”</p>
<p>I think generally we were just happy to interact with each other, especially on such a fun holiday and a beautiful day. It was something that I’ll always remember, and wouldn’t hesitate to do it again.</p>

<p>Jones pitched a four-hit shutout for her first career win in the second game of the Elizabethtown doubleheader. The freshman walked one and struck out six, including back-to-back whiffs of the Blue Jays&#8217; fourth and fifth hitters to end scoring threats in both the first and third innings.</p>

<p>Kennedy hit .450 with three runs scored and three RBI in a 3-2 week for the Mules. He also walked once and was hit twice for a .522 on-base percentage. Kennedy had three hits in each game of the Penn State Brandywine doubleheader sweep and started an inning-ending 5-4-3 double play with the bases loaded and score tied in the seventh inning of the nightcap.</p>

Enjoy!</p>
<p><strong>Men&#8217;s Lacrosse vs. Franklin &amp; Marshall (Saturday, 7:00)</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg will be collecting food items and donations for the Second Harvest Food Bank at this game. Most food shelters receive plenty of donations around the holiday season. It is right around spring time when their supplies run out, so this is a very important time to give.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-104" title="Mule Marquee Matchup" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1-300x203.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="203" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1-300x203.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Do not expect the spirit of giving to carry over to the lacrosse field. Centennial Conference games are usually closely contested, and these two teams have taken that to an extreme, going to double overtime last year and triple overtime in 2008 and 2010. Those three games were all in Lancaster; the last meeting in Allentown was a relative blowout, with Muhlenberg winning 10-8.</p>
<p>It could be another close one. Although the Mules come in 2-4 and the Diplomats 5-1 and receiving votes in the national poll, both teams played at Susquehanna with similar results: Muhlenberg won 9-7, and F&amp;M won 9-8 in overtime.</p>

<p><strong>Women&#8217;s Lacrosse vs. Franklin &amp; Marshall (Saturday, 1:00)</strong></p>
<p>As close as the men&#8217;s series with F&amp;M has been, the women&#8217;s has gone the other way. The Mules are winless in 28 all-time games against the Diplomats, but they will try to change that after getting off to a 3-0 start.</p>
<p>F&amp;M (3-1), which won national championships in 2007 and 2009, is tied for eighth in the Division III poll.</p>

			<p><em>The last of our three Spring Break reports is by Nick Gazzillo, a sophomore outfielder on the Muhlenberg baseball team.</em></p>
<p>“My worst fear every year is that someone will get to the gate and say, ‘Coach, I don’t have my ID.’ Don’t let that happen.” This was Coach Goff’s first message to the baseball team during the meeting prior to our trip to Fort Myers, Florida.</p>
<div id="attachment_950" style="width: 330px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/flablog1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-950" class="size-full wp-image-950" title="baseball in Ft. Myers" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/flablog1.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="239" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/flablog1.jpg 320w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/flablog1-300x224.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-950" class="wp-caption-text">ID safely in tow, Usewick and Nick Gies get some sleep on the bus en route to the airport</p></div>
<p>Well, apparently freshman infielder Danny Usewick wasn’t paying attention during that part of the meeting. If a 5 a.m. bus ride to the Philadelphia airport wasn’t enjoyable enough for the team, watching Danny scramble through the bus, locker room and his dorm room was surely the thing to get the trip off on the right foot. He eventually found his ID and the Mules arrived in Florida ready for nine days of baseball.</p>
<p>The mission was clear. We were down there to play baseball, collectively get better as a team, learn to “hold the rope” for one another and win some games. The always classy senior Nick “Goose” Busillo kept these goals clear, stating: “We gotta play &#8217;em one day at a time. I&#8217;m just happy to be here and hope I can help the ballclub. I just wanna give it my best shot and, Good Lord willing, things&#8217;ll work out.&#8221;</p>
<p><em><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/33photo8.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-949" title="baseball in Ft. Myers" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/33photo8-300x201.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="201" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/33photo8-300x201.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/33photo8-445x300.jpg 445w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/33photo8.jpg 465w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Bull Durham </em>quotes aside, the trip revolved around a very busy baseball schedule, one that included 6:30 a.m. bus rides to the field and late returns to the hotel. Through it all, however, the team found plenty of time to relax and get their minds off baseball for a while. Movies, video games and team dinners gave us a chance to unwind and rest.</p>
<p>The trip saw the continuation of two traditions of the Muhlenberg baseball program. Outrageous haircuts and facial hair kept the superstitious happy and the rest of the team embarrassed to be seen with them. Games of “mental warfare” kept the freshmen confused and frustrated and the upperclassmen laughing, especially junior pitcher Rob Shannon, also known as “the ghost” due to both the fact that he was never seen in his hotel room and his very pale skin.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/baseteam12_fla.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-946" title="baseball team photo" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/baseteam12_fla.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="166" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/baseteam12_fla.jpg 600w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/baseteam12_fla-300x83.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/baseteam12_fla-500x138.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p>A large outdoor mall located across the street from the hotel provided another getaway for many of the players, although crossing the six-lane highway proved to be a challenge for many, especially when the sprinklers decided to go off on the median.</p>
<p>Players also found time to hang out at the hotel&#8217;s pool. While it was relaxing for most, junior outfielder John Muha and freshman infielder Mike Giordano found out the hard way not to stand near the edge of the pool when sophomore infielder John Scuderi is around. On the bright side, both hits and subsequent splashes were captured on camera and can currently be seen on Facebook.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/33photo7.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-948" title="baseball in Ft. Myers" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/33photo7-175x300.jpg" alt="" width="175" height="300" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/33photo7-175x300.jpg 175w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/33photo7.jpg 314w" sizes="(max-width: 175px) 100vw, 175px" /></a>The pool wasn’t the only place that saw hostility. From the time the bus arrived at the hotel every night, it was a race to get to the only two washing machines in the hotel. Many players found their uniforms to have a more pungent scent than others, and looking at our record, that may have given us an edge over the other teams.</p>
<p>We split our first two games on the first day and won two more games over the following two days before a well-deserved day off. Players were able to spend time with families that had made the trip down, while others spent the day at the beach or by the pool.</p>
<p>The Mules went on to win three of the remaining four games, finishing with a 6-2 record for the trip and a 9-2 record overall. As senior Brian Beck put it, “It was a good, successful trip. We played well as a team and picked each other when we needed to. We were focused on winning baseball games and having fun.”</p>
<div id="attachment_947" style="width: 234px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/flablog2.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-947" class="size-medium wp-image-947" title="baseball in Ft.

<p>Maybe even more important than the results, the team walked away from the trip closer than beforehand. Senior Mike Speroni gave his view, saying, “The chemistry we have on our team is outstanding. It was enjoyable to get to know the true personalities of everyone, especially the freshmen. I’m really excited about the next few weeks and holding on to the rope.”</p>
<p>The team is off to one of its best starts in history and looks forward to continuing the winning trend back in Allentown. No matter how the season ends up, the Fort Myers trip is sure to be one of the highlights of the year.</p>

			<p><em>Our second Spring Break report comes from women&#8217;s lacrosse co-captain Angela Napoletano in Hilton Head.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/wlax-springbreak5.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-934" title="women's lacrosse in Hilton Head" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/wlax-springbreak5.jpg" alt="" width="276" height="373" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/wlax-springbreak5.jpg 276w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/wlax-springbreak5-221x300.jpg 221w" sizes="(max-width: 276px) 100vw, 276px" /></a>After enduring a 13-hour-long bus ride, filled with eating, sleeping and some more eating, we finally arrived at the Sea Pines Resort in Hilton Head, South Carolina, at 6 p.m. on Saturday. Although the rain put a damper on unloading the bus, everyone on the team was very excited to be here and ran to their villas to pick their rooms. The team was split into three villas of about nine people each. Each villa was required to prepare a meal one night for everyone on the team. </p>
<p>Waking up early on Sunday morning was not as bad as everyone had expected it to be due to the anticipation of playing in the warm 70-degree weather. The fields of Hilton Head are definitely not the surface we are used to playing on. Barker Field, with its grass, dirt and mud terrain, made for an interesting adjustment to prepare for our game on Tuesday, but our team was up for the challenge. Needless to say, after a long two-hour practice in the heat, we were ready for a home-cooked meal.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/wlax-springbreak2.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-930" title="women's lacrosse in Hilton Head" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/wlax-springbreak2.jpg" alt="" width="397" height="296" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/wlax-springbreak2.jpg 397w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/wlax-springbreak2-300x223.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 397px) 100vw, 397px" /></a>My villa was picked to cook for everyone the first night, so when we went shopping at the famous Piggly Wiggly on Sunday after practice, the employees and residents of Hilton Head were a bit overwhelmed by the influx of our team.</p>
<p>The picture does not even show all of the compartments under the bus that contained the food we bought, but going shopping allows us to have all the food we want for the week.  For dinner, my villa chose to make baked ziti with garlic bread and salad along with a birthday cake for the newly 21 year old Alexandra Franck.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/wlax-springbreak1.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-929" title="women's lacrosse in Hilton Head" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/wlax-springbreak1.jpg" alt="" width="271" height="363" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/wlax-springbreak1.jpg 271w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/wlax-springbreak1-223x300.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 271px) 100vw, 271px" /></a>After being in Hilton Head last year for Spring Break, we knew all of the good spots we had to go back to visit. Besides our Bieber bus, our only method of transportation around the island was rented bikes. Being that all of us are between the ages of 18 and 22, one would think that we know how to ride a bike. However, that was not the case for sophomore Veronica Maccia. Unfortunately, she did not make it through our first bike ride on the island in one piece after falling off and scraping up her knees, hands and toes. She has the evidence to prove it with multiple scrapes and bruises.</p>
<p>The Salty Dog was a favorite among our team last year and the restaurant and shops were at the top of the list to go back to, where everyone either purchased a sweatshirt, long sleeve, hat or tank with the Salty Dog logo on it.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/wlax-springbreak3.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-931" title="women's lacrosse in Hilton Head" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/wlax-springbreak3.jpg" alt="" width="194" height="261" /></a>Although the Salty Dog was enjoyed by everyone, we knew the next day we had to get focused in order to win the game we came down here to play. We knew going into the game that it was going to be good competition against regional rivals Eastern University. The beginning seemed grim as we got off to a slow start, allowing Eastern to score in the first 30seconds of the game. At halftime we were up 8-7, but we knew we needed to make a lot of changes to win this game. We came out in the second half holding Eastern to three goals while we stepped up and rattled off five straight goals to solidify the win. After a game with multiple fouls and rough play we were proud to come out with the win. Knowing that we came down to Hilton Head on a 13-hour bus ride to play this one game gave us incentive to play without regrets and put everything out on the field.</p>
<p>The celebration of our win came to a sudden halt when we discovered that the “Muhlen-plague” had followed us to South Carolina. Unfortunately seven of us were unable to practice and be outside in the beautiful weather with the rest of our team. As I sit here writing this blog with Kaitlyn McCaffrey, the rest of our team is out enjoying a hibachi dinner, which has nothing on our Gatorade and saltine cracker diet.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/wlax-springbreak4.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-932" title="women's lacrosse in Hilton Head" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/wlax-springbreak4.jpg" alt="" width="259" height="365" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/wlax-springbreak4.jpg 259w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/wlax-springbreak4-212x300.jpg 212w" sizes="(max-width: 259px) 100vw, 259px" /></a>This image of the lighthouse in Harbor Town will be forever embedded in our minds, especially on our long bus ride home on Friday. While we are sad to leave the beautiful Hilton Head, we need to focus on the rest of our season. The stomach bug won’t keep us down for long because when we come back to Allentown, we have our home opener Wednesday against Lebanon Valley, and our first conference game against F&amp;M Saturday. Even though we had great experiences here we are excited to return back to Muhlenberg to continue our success as a team. HEE HAA HOO HAA, GO BERG!</p>

<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/sbflorida3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-921" title="softball team in Florida" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/sbflorida3.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="285" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/sbflorida3.jpg 500w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/sbflorida3-300x171.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>Despite having a few bad experiences with planes in the past, the Muhlenberg softball team boarded an AirTran flight from Lehigh Valley International Airport to Orlando, Florida, this past Friday night. Although we can say that the flight was more smooth than normal (yet, we obviously did hit turbulence), the process of getting through the airport in Allentown was not boring, as expected. One of my classmates couldn’t stand still enough to stop the metal detector from blaring sirens time after time. If you know the softball girls, you could probably make a great guess as to who this was (Elizabeth Sullivan). The security guard had to tell her to take a breath before she finally got through after the third try. Needless to say, we were all very excited for what Florida had to bring for our group.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/sbflorida4.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-922" title="softball team in Florida" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/sbflorida4.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="323" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/sbflorida4.jpg 350w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/sbflorida4-300x276.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/sbflorida4-325x300.jpg 325w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" /></a>After the flight landed, we were happy campers as all of our bags arrived safely, including our protective net known as Nancy, which the freshmen get to know very well each season. Although it was around eight at night, the temperature was still so hot that many of us had to ditch the black sweatsuit onesies for t-shirts and shorts. It was definitely needed, especially because we had to pack all of our equipment and bags into two white vans before we took off on our journey for food.</p>
<p>We stopped at Denny’s on our way to our vacation homes, which personally made me feel very content. It wasn’t even three hours into the trip and the Mules already were getting “grand slams” (pun intended). We then drove and split up into our three vacation homes, each housing teammates from each class. My home was called “Tranquility” by coach, yet she put me in a house with all worry-some, stressed out and crazy players. Being one myself, though, we seemed to gel quite nicely on our first night in Clermont.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/sbflorida2.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-923" title="softball team in Florida" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/sbflorida2.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="398" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/sbflorida2.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/sbflorida2-226x300.jpg 226w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Saturday morning we woke up early to embark on coach’s FAVORITE part of the entire trip, grocery shopping at WalMart! I hope by the capitalized letters that one might catch the sarcasm, beings that the past two years that we’ve been in Florida, there has always been an issue with our credit card. Coach, though, remembered to up our limit and things turned out great!</p>
<p>It is always a fun experience for the houses to shop because we get to pick out exactly what we want for the week. My house chose a lot of cereals, fruits and coffee (of course). We then had a two-hour practice at Hancock Fields in the beautiful Florida weather. Usually our practice in Florida is the first one that we have outside all season, but thankfully the weather in Allentown was oddly nice in February, so this was our fourth practice outside before the games began.</p>
<p>After our practice we had time to go back to our houses, shower and eat before we got to go to ESPN’s Wide World of Sports to watch some Division I games. This has been my favorite leisure part of the trip so far because I got to see my favorite team, University of Michigan, play live right in front of my eyes for the first time. It was really inspiring watching them play because they were so smooth and confident. We definitely learned a lot watching them and other teams. It was a great experience.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/sbflorida1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-924" title="softball team in Florida" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/sbflorida1.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="211" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/sbflorida1.jpg 500w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/03/sbflorida1-300x126.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>Sunday came around and it was all business for Berg softball. With a “Fired Up” inspired pregame chant in play, and first-game excitement jitters in our favor, we came out looking as strong as we left off last year. Simmons’ first two at-bats were back-to-back doubles, scoring one run in the first before our defense finished the half of the inning. What Simmons didn’t know was that our bats were not going to stay silent. We played a great first game and it was an amazing feeling to get a win under our belts, especially by putting up seven runs. We then battled against a tough team from Iowa and lost one game immediately after the first one.</p>
<p>All in all though, I felt personally that we were going to be just fine. “Not worried. Still not worried” &#8211; Shelby Smith. We came out the next morning and ended up competing in four games in a total of 21 hours. Not making any excuses, but we came out flat and tired and definitely NOT how Muhlenberg softball rolls.</p>
<p>Let it be known, folks, that we don’t plan on staying on the L-train for any longer. Our next games are Wednesday (today) and two more on Thursday, giving us plenty of motivation to get back to where we started the season: in the winner’s column.</p>
<p>With Tuesday being our off day, a lot of the girls’ families were down here in Florida and family time involved an array of activities, such as going to Sea World, Harry Potter World, Phillies spring training games, Orlando Outlets, or just laying by the pool. One thing is for sure: on our day off, we planned to revamp and refresh ourselves for our next stretch of games in Clermont. Stay tuned on the Athletics Website for scores and updates, and thank you to all who have been following and supporting us. B-E-R-G, GOOO BERG!</p>

			<p>If it seemed like the 2011-12 season was a particularly good one for basketball at Muhlenberg, that&#8217;s because it was.</p>
<p>The Mule women ended their season in the second round of the NCAA Tournament at Mount Union on Saturday, bringing down the curtain on one of the best winters of basketball in College history.</p>
<p>The women finished with a record of 23-6, while the men were 18-9. The 41 combined wins were the second-most ever at Muhlenberg. Here are the top 10 years for combined wins:</p>
<ul>
<li>2008-09    42-15 (women 26-4, men 16-11)</li>
<li><strong>2011-12    41-15 (women 23-6, men 18-9)</strong></li>
<li>2001-02    40-10 (women 21-4, men 19-6)</li>
<li>2005-06    40-15 (women 26-3, men 14-12)</li>
<li>1985-86    36-15 (men 20-7, women 16-8)</li>
<li>2010-11    36-18 (women 23-6, men 13-12)</li>
<li>1997-98    35-20 (women 18-10, men 17-10)</li>
<li>2009-10    34-20 (women 21-6, men 13-14)</li>
<li>1998-99    33-18 (men 17-8, women 16-10)</li>
<li>1996-97    33-18 (women 18-8, men 15-10)</li>
</ul>
<p>During the season both Mule teams won two tournaments, one at home (the Scotty Wood Tournament) and one on the road (the Gallaudet Holiday Tournament for the men, the Centennial Conference playoffs for the women).</p>
<p>The men came within one win of the CC title. It was the eighth time in the 19-year history of the league that a school placed both its men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s team in the championship game, and the first time since 2000 that a school did so and came away with one title:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>2012 Muhlenberg (women won, men lost)</strong></li>
<li>2008 Gettysburg (both lost)</li>
<li>2006 Johns Hopkins (both lost)</li>
<li>2004 Johns Hopkins (both lost)</li>
<li>2000 Johns Hopkins (women won, men lost)</li>
<li>1999 Johns Hopkins (both won)</li>
<li>1998 Muhlenberg (both won)</li>
<li>1998 Johns Hopkins (both lost)</li>
</ul>
<p>Both Mule teams wound up exactly where they were predicted to in the CC preseason polls (the women first and the men second). But to say the seasons went as expected would be a stretch. Both teams started strong (a combined 17-2 in November and December), faltered in January (a combined 9-9) and hit their strides coming down the stretch (a combined 11-2 in February leading up to the playoffs).</p>
<p>In January, before the teams hit their rough patch, we wrote about the <a title="Win-Win Proposition" href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/2012/01/11/win-win-proposition/">success of both teams</a>. The article referred to an &#8220;infectious culture of winning.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now that the infection has taken hold, the Mules and their fans hope it continues to spread in the coming years.</p>
