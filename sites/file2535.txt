					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Reality TV is tailor made for these kinds of producer-client partnerships, it seems.  Programs like MTV&#039;s The Hills and even American Idol all have introduced sponsorship within the program itself, leaving viewers with nowhere to hide if they wish to skip the advertising.  It&#039;s also a plus that this kind of programming is so cheap to produce, which boosts its profit margin even higher through this kind of advertising.  Thanks for the interesting article!&lt;/p&gt;
