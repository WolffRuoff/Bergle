								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Lisa Siciliano &#8217;10 blogs about her summer internship.</em></p>
<p><em></em><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-143" src="http://mediacom.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2009/10/mtv_logo_by_h4v0c.jpg" alt="mtv_logo_by_h4v0c" width="180" height="180" srcset="http://mediacom.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2009/10/mtv_logo_by_h4v0c.jpg 300w, http://mediacom.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2009/10/mtv_logo_by_h4v0c-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 180px) 100vw, 180px" />How did I get an internship at MTV Networks?  I’m not 100% sure, but I would credit it to a strong resume and skill set as well as good luck and good timing.  Along with getting all A’s, choreographing a dance, and trying to live the college life, obtaining a summer internship was one of my greatest goals of the Spring 2008 semester.  After researching programs during my winter break, shadowing a Muhlenberg Alum at NBC, and fine tuning my resume and cover letter with help from The Career Center, I applied to MTV, ABC, and NBC.  I started receiving e-mails from MTV&#8217;s Human Resources Department and had various phone interviews with my future boss. By the end of finals, I was officially an MTV Networks Intern.  I worked for the Digital Encoding Services, and though I had no idea what I was in for, I was excited.</p>
<p>Digital Encoding Services is located on the tenth floor of MTV Networks, right in the middle of Times Square.  Its main objective is to prepare files to be sent to various “Download to Own” clients such as I-Tunes, X-Box, Amazon.com, Hulu, and more.  The episodes you watch of your favorite MTV shows on I-Tunes are put together by us!  DES also works with On-Demand programming for a variety of networks.  MTV Networks is not just MTV, but Spike, Comedy Central, Nickelodeon, Noggin, The N, VH1, MTV 2, and more.  One of the newer projects I worked on was preparing for the premiere of the new EPIX on demand movie channel for August.</p>
<p>My day to day duties included a variety of somewhat challenging projects.  I put my editing skills to use and edited files with Final Cut Pro—taking out the black commercial slugs.  I learned how to transcode, or crop files for certain specifications.  I encoded a variety of files, putting them on the computer from the tape to make sendable files.  I watched hours of television shows from “Dora the Explorer” to “Trucks” to “My Super Sweet Sixteen,” looking for any video or audio errors that would interrupt the file quality.  I even was a test audience member for the new show, “It’s On With Alexa Chung!”  I learned something new every day.</p>
<p>My internship at MTV Networks allowed me to put the theories and skills I have learned in Muhlenberg classes to use and it opened my eyes to how different the corporate world is from the classroom.  This internship reaffirmed that television production is something that I definitely want to pursue for at least part of my adult life.  Thankfully, I know that I can take the great experiences and the same determination and persistence that I used to get the internship to allow me to be successful in my life after Muhlenberg.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Professor Sue Curry Jansen&#8217;s research has long been concerned with the relationship between media and democracy.  In her most recent article, &#8220;Phantom Conflict: Lippmann, Dewey and the Fate of the Public,&#8221; published this month in <em>Communication and Critical Cultural Studies, </em>Dr. Jansen brings historical analysis to bear on a deeply misunderstood but dominant view of the intellectual legacies of John Dewey and Walter Lippmann.  In her abstract, Jansen explains:</p>
<p><span style="font-family:tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;line-height:normal"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-73" src="http://mediaandcommunication.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/rccc.jpg" alt="RCCC" width="211" height="300" />Contrary to the prevailing view in media and cultural studies, philosopher John Dewey and journalist Walter Lippmann did not represent different schools of thought. They were not adversaries in a great public debate about the fate of the public in modern democracies in the 1920s. Rather, their exchange about the “phantom” public was reframed as a conflict in the early 1980s, a reframing which has achieved broad interdisciplinary acceptance even though its rests on a casual rhetorical trope, not historical documentation. The reframing provides a salutary but inaccurate origin story for American media and cultural studies, illustrates the hazards of relying on secondary interpretations of historical sources, and deflects attention away from realistic assessment of the problems confronting democracy today. Dismantling this disciplinary folklore is essential to the integrity of the emerging “new history” of media and communication.</span></p>

<p>Like many students at Muhlenberg, Eirinn Disbrow and Avivah Furman wanted to volunteer to make their world a better place. They quickly realized however, that making a difference was much more difficult than they had thought. Undeterred, they decided to make a documentary about the challenges of volunteerism. The resulting feature, <em>Good Intentions,</em> debuted this past Friday at Muhlenberg&#8217;s Recital Hall.</p>
<p>Supported by a competitive summer research grant from Muhlenberg, Disbrow and Furman joined a group of American students who signed up to volunteer in Costa Rica. They documented their own experiences and those of their colleagues, focusing on the students&#8217; eagerness and occasional naivete. The film, completed with assistance from a number of Media &amp; Comm faculty,  is a compelling account of the challenges that stand between good intentions and successful results.</p>
<p>Disbrow is a Media &amp; Communication major and Creative Writing minor from Wilton, CT. Furman is a Media &amp; Communication and Film Studies major from Hastings-on-Hudson, NY. Both are juniors.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Dr. Elizabeth Nathanson is joining the department this semester as a temporary replacement for Dr. Jeff Pooley while he completes a fellowship at the University of Pennsylvania. Dr. Nathanson is a recent Ph.D. graduate from the Screen Cultures program at Northwestern University.  Her research focuses on how contemporary American popular culture represents women&#8217;s everyday life, specifically life at home, in the postfeminist context.  She explores how the media as technologies and as cultural forms organize women&#8217;s time and depict women&#8217;s experiences of the time-crunch and life cycle in the contemporary context.  Her work includes studies of lifestyle television, cooking programs, arts and crafts television shows, depictions of pregnancy and childbirth in popular film, and the impact of new technologies like TiVo and the Internet on cultural constructions of &#8220;women&#8217;s time.&#8221;  Her article on domestic temporal efficiency and the Food Network show <em>30 Minute Meals</em> will be published by <em>Television and New Media</em> this summer.  Her work has also appeared in <em>Framework. </em>Before entering graduate school, she worked for the Education Department at the American Museum of the Moving Image in New York City. She is teaching Popular Culture and Communication, 20th Century Media, and a special topics course called &#8220;Media and the Home.&#8221;</p>
