								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anxiety disorder is hard to diagnose due to its &#8220;hidden&#8221; nature and its ambiguity to those who spend the most time around a child, so most parents and teachers will not notice that their child has symptoms associated with anxiety. The differentiation between the many anxiety disorders is difficult, due to the fact that everyone has a natural anxious response to threats.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When diagnosing anxiety, one of the things clinicians will look at is the hereditary aspect of anxiety. Biological vulnerability to anxiety means that there is an increased risk for formation of an anxiety disorder, when someone has anxiety in the family. This can be explained by increased risk of anxiety to children who have parents who have higher alertness and hypervigilance to their surroundings. I think that understanding that immediate family with anxiety correlates and suggests predispositions for anxiety is really important because it can help us prevent and be aware of warning signs early on in a child’s development. Additionally, anxiety can be a result of overly structured family life (Barrett, Rapee, Dadds, &amp; Ryan 1996), such that “high anxiety in a child is significantly related to frequent negative feedback and parental restriction.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In my outside research, I have found that some specified anxiety disorders are more likely to be considered hereditary than others. Specifically, Torgersen (1983), explains that heredity does not seem to be such a large influencer for generalized anxiety disorder in comparison with other anxiety disorders (panic disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder) or psychiatric disorders. Moreover, the researchers also explains that the interaction between the environment in which one develops and their biology is critical in understanding anxiety disorder. Though, the study doesn’t have enough evidence to draw conclusions. Knowing the effects and contributions that environments can impose on the development of anxiety for children is important, because then it can be controlled and monitored. </span></p>
