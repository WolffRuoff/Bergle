Kan, M. April 27, 2011. China&#8217;s Baidu Revenue, Profits Up on Strong Traffic Growth.<em> Network World</em>. Retried from <a href="http://www.networkworld.com/news/2011/042811-chinas-baidu-revenue-profits-up.html">http://www.networkworld.com/news/2011/042811-chinas-baidu-revenue-profits-up.html</a></p>
<p>Google dominants search in nearly every corner of the world, except in one: China. Google’s forays into the lucrative Chinese internet search marketplace, which is estimated at 457 million users, have captured less than 20% of the market. Baidu, an eleven year old competitor, offers many similar services to those provided by Google, yet has gained a significant market share by leveraging linking pin power roles. For instance, Baidu is the “default search engine in 80 percent of Andriod phones in China&#8230;because the mobile operating system is open-source software, device manufactures can make changes to it.” Baidu is pre-installed on devices through revenue sharing agreements with manufacturers.</p>
<p><span id="more-1182"></span></p>
<p>Baidu’s power as a exhibitor in the Chinese search market exceeds that of Google in the Unted States (approx. 65%), and rivals Google’s dominance in Europe (closer to 80%). This runs in paradox to the belief that American media power tends to be more concentrated than the European media system. The internet industry differs in this regard from traditional media. One reason may be the entrepreneurial spirit in the United States encourages more imitators and competitors; backed by venture capital firms (an important investor power role in the internet industry) that provide billions of dollars annually to internet start ups.</p>

<p>Lee, E. (April 14, 2011). Google Turns in Mixed Quarter; Loses Search-Market Share. <em>Advertising Age</em>. Retrieved from <a id="internal-source-marker_0.5988184520974755" href="http://adage.com/article/digital/google-turns-mixed-quarter-loses-search-market-share/227004/">http://adage.com/article/digital/google-turns-mixed-quarter-loses-search-market-share/227004/</a></p>
<div>When Google posted its second quarter financial reports, the big news that sent Google’s shares down 5 percent was not a 27% increase in revenue to $8.58 billion, $2.3 billion in profit, or a statement by Susan Wojcicki, head of advertising products, that YouTube “is doubling revenue year over year.” Edmond Lee writes “according to search-marketing firm Experian Hitwise, Google dropped its slice of the market from 71% in the first quarter of 2010 to 66% this quarter.” Although still the dominant player in search, Google’s power as a content distributor is lessened, although from the consumers perspective the search engine distributor power role is dominated by a handful of major players, including Bing and Yahoo!.&nbsp;</p>
<div><span id="more-1129"></span></div>
</div>
<p>Freshman Google CEO Larry Page downplayed the sliding search market share, emphasizing “that future growth will come outside of search, so the company is touting the big investments it’s making in display ads, YouTube, mobile and the Chrome web browser.” In a nod to a power roles analysis, Google’s recent acquisition of Next New Networks, “which helps promote webshows and package them to advertisers,” has “prompted Google to set aside as much as $100 million to finance more production across many content partnerships.”Google takes in much of its revenue by leveraging the client power role, and is not known as a producer of content, but rather as an exhibitor (YouTube).</p>
<p>Yet, in a develop specific to the Internet industry, unregulated vertical integration is widely embraced by conglomerates such as Google and Yahoo!. It is a logical conclusion, as cross-promotion (through the linking pin power role) creates a synergistic web audience (which equals advertising revenue) across Google owned (or controlled) distribution, exhibition and production organizations. For instance, one could search Google, click on a search result for a YouTube video, and consume a video produced by a firm financed Google’s $100 million investment in content production; all the while exposed to advertisements displayed by DoubleClick (owned by Google).</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Patel, K. (April 4, 2011). Networks, Exchanges Are Not Immune to Groupon-Cloning Fad. <em>Advertising Age.</em> Retrieved from <a href="http://adage.com/article/special-report-audience-buying-guide/networks-exchanges-immune-groupon-cloning-fad/149656/">http://adage.com/article/special-report-audience-buying-guide/networks-exchanges-immune-groupon-cloning-fad/149656/</a></p>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://www.welovedc.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/groupon.png" alt="" width="400" height="155" /> Groupon uses the power of the traditional “group discount,” and economies of scale, to save individuals money. When a certain number of people opt-in, they all benefit from the discount. One may consider Groupon the improved digital incarnate of coupon circulars, socialized to create better deals. This has attracted the attention of the newspaper industry, as newspaper titans such as Hearst and New York Times have contracted with smaller distributors in the emerging “deals market,” or exchanges, such Analog Analytics. For example:</p>
<div><span id="more-1050"></span></div>
<div>
<blockquote><p>On Analog, a publisher like the Register, which sells the deal, gets 15% of all deals sold on any site; the publisher that distributes the deal &#8212; LA News, in this case &#8212; gets 20% and Analog gets 15% for brokering. (The merchant, per the usual Groupon model, gets the 	remaining 50%.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Deals networks such as ReachLocal and Tippr easily entered the deals market, breaking the traditional high barriers to entry that existed with printed circular coupons. While Groupon and LivingSocial are dominate players in the deals market, power is less concentrated because of the ease at which new locally focused exhibitors can enter the market. For example, Facebook is working with ReachLocal to target audiences in San Deigo, while using Tippr, Gilt City, OpenTable and PopSugar City to target markets in other cities.</p>
<p>The power roles frame classifies these Internet group coupon companies as an exhibitors and producers. Smaller companies occupy the exhibitor role, choosing to give up a certain percent of profit to brokers such as Analog Analytics (who produce the deals).  This allows for smaller exhibitors to compete with the major players in the industry. Without the help of deals suppliers such as Adility, who have built up relationships with local merchants over the years with printed coupons, these larger companies would have near complete control the industry.</p>

(March 22, 2011). P&amp;G, Best Buy, Google, EA, Twitter Headline Ad Age&#8217;s Digital Conference April 6-7.

<p>On April 6th &amp; 7th, AdAge will facilitate the fifth annual Digital Conference, “where marketers, publishers, agency executives, digital strategists, creative technologists and Internet entrepreneurs will share their visions for the digital and emerging media landscape, along with their stories of what&#8217;s working and what&#8217;s not.” This year’s conference headlines the burgeoning relationship between the video-gaming industry, online social media services and mobile platforms.<br />
<span id="more-976"></span><br />
Social Media platforms have found many new and innovative ways to generate profits. Twitter’s Promoted Tweets platform that currently allow major advertisers to get their ‘160 Characters of Fame’ when their tweets show up on users twitter feeds.  At the conference, Twitter’s President of Global Revenues will show the monetization structure of the platform and discuss future paid advertising opportunities.</p>
<p>Another important up-and-coming industry that will be discussed at the conference is the new social shopping and group-buying companies like Groupon and Living Social. These companies act as distributors and exhibitors for either local or national companies to push out deals to consumers who can get discounts if their is a certain predetermined number of users who express interest opt in.</p>
<p>Consumer demand has shifted industry focus from a console-game model to a multi-platform model utilizing the Internet (with services such as Xbox Live and the PlayStation Network). The shift has developed new revenue sources while creating an experience driven by social interaction. Revenue models have expanded to include more transactions after the initial purchasing of the game, making the experience more engaging and longer lasting. The shift dilutes the distribution power of traditional game-consoles, as new platforms emerge as distribution channels for video-gaming.</p>
<p>Additionally, social platforms, especially Facebook, have seen great profits from the implementation of their gaming platform.  Games Like Mafia Wars, the Oregon Trail, and Farmville, have built up major followings, and only allow users a limited number of moves within a set time period, which can be extended if users are willing to pay, which surprisingly a great number of people are. Here, we see the shifting creator and producer power roles, as small application developers can create a prolific number of new applications at low cost, a parallel to the traditional economic boom/bust model in media industries.</p></div>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Calkins, T., &amp; Rucker, D. (2011, February 3). Will Social Media Slay the Super Bowl? Retrieved February 5, 2011, from <a href="http://adage.com/cmostrategy/article?article_id=148644">http://adage.com/cmostrategy/article?article_id=148644</a></p>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://realvision.ae/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/pepsi_superbowl_miniscreen_social_media-300x226.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="226" />Companies are spending less money advertising during the Super Bowl and putting more funding and efforts into social media marketing because some companies feel that social media is more useful in developing brand recognition. The key to brand recognition is what the authors refer to as engagement with the audience. They discuss the barriers to online engagement, such as pop-up blockers and users on Facebook and Twitter, who may follow or become fans of a company’s page, but not actively participate with the brand. The authors argue that Superbowl ads are still more effective at engaging audiences because they generate buzz.<br />
<span id="more-727"></span></p>
<blockquote><p>Many people watch the Super Bowl primarily for the advertising, which they then continue to talk about afterward. The ads are posted on YouTube and countless blogs; news outlets comment on them and people discuss them in the office the next day.</p></blockquote>
<p>Consumers are currently spending as much time on the Internet or their smart-phones as they do watching television, so advertisers must flock to where the the viewers are. Despite this, even the companies with the greatest social presences can fail to capture the attention of consumers. Changing times and technologies challenge companies to capture the buzz generated from Superbowl advertising and carry it into social media platforms. The most effective advertising integrates different forms of media to create synergistic engagement with consumers across multiple platforms and at every aspect of a consumer’s day. As consumers spend more time online, advertising dollars will shift to online advertising, to be where the consumer spends the most time.</p>
<p>If more companies go the path of Ford and Pepsi and choose to spend their advertising dollars online rather than paying for, at most, minutes during the Super Bowl, it could have a significant impact on the television industry, and putting money into television advertisements will be less cost effective. As a result of these trends the Internet advertising industry will increase in usage.</p>
<p>Advertising agencies, as the creators/producers, need to work harder to ensure that they engage the appropriate audiences through the right channels for their specific clients, especially due to the fast changes in technology. Additionally, social media platforms are becoming more powerful exhibitors in the advertising world.</p>
