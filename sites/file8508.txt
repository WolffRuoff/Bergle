								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Facebook is just another one of the countless forms of social media that my generation uses to see what their “friends” are doing. One’s news feed is the endless list that updates itself as people upload new content. These news feeds encompass status updates, pictures, and even articles that people like and share. The problem with Facebook occurs when users accept friend requests from people they don&#8217;t actually know. Now these strangers have access to not only personal pictures, but personal information.</p>
<p>Robert Lemieux, a professor in the communication department at McDaniel College, conducted a study about privacy on Facebook. His participants had to construct a fictitious profile with the name Jamie Marple and a profile picture showing both a girl and a boy. The name Jamie was chosen because of the possibility that it could fit either gender. The only other information on the profile aside from the name and the extremely vague picture, was “Jamie’s” date of birth and hometown. “Since the study’s primary interest was to test the likelihood of being accepted as a friend based on limited, personal information, Jamie’s personal information was severely limited” (Lemieux, 2012). Another group of participants within the study were informed to friend Jamie and write on her profile. This made it look like Jamie was real and active user.</p>
<p>The entire purpose of Lemieux’s study was to see if people would accept a friend request from a person with a questionable profile that they really did not know. The results proved that kids are willing to accept friend requests from even the profiles that have meager amounts of information. “Results indicated that 325 Facebook members (72% of the sample) willingly accepted the friendship of the unknown individual” (Lemieux, 2012). More than 50% of Facebook users were willing to welcome a new friendship despite knowing such a minute amount of information about them.</p>
<p>What’s the issue with this? Why is it so bad to casually accept a friend request on Facebook? You see that you have some mutual friends with this persons so it must not be a big deal. Many problems however could come along with the spontaneous action of accepting anyone and everyone. Not only is your privacy in jeopardy, but your security is too. Once accepting that friend request, the person on the other side of the computer has access to very personal information like where you live or where you go to school. They can also see pictures that you post, and pictures other people post of you. One day someone unwanted could find out where you live or the wrong person could see you at a party holding a beer. Would you want that?</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The concepts of identity, self-promotion, and manipulation of an intended audience are significant aspects of the Twitter world. Users have become addicted to the “micro-celebrity” (Marwick 121) social status and are feeding off of their, “audience that they can strategically maintain through ongoing communication and interaction” (Marwick 121). It’s interesting to see the different goals that each Twitter user has in mind when posting tweets for the public to see. Some users, such as giant corporations, use specific marketing tactics to manipulate users and appeal to a niche’s specific interests. “Soraya Darabi, the social media strategist for the New York Times, said, ‘I’m constantly aware of my followers.’” (Marwick 126) She is the perfect example of what it looks like to have an inauthentic goal in mind when tweeting, for she creates an explicit social image for the sole purpose of gaining followers and possible fiscal rewards. Soraya Darabi does not use Twitter for her own personal self expression, her decision, “to reveal personal information”, is, “strategic, and often framed as a way to reinforce relationships with followers” (Marwick 127). This contrasts with individuals who do not have a lot of followers because their “audience awareness”, does not, “factor greatly into their writing” (Marwick 116). Twitter users who do not have many followers “see Twitter as a personal space” (Marwick 124), in which authenticity is maintained and balanced with impression management.</p>
<p>The audience also plays a large role in the kinds of tweets produced. Since users can not actually comprehend the extent of their audience, “a tweets actual readers differ from its producer’s imagined audience” (Marwick 117). Between other social platforms that allow the share feature, tweets can be seen on countless, “communication channels” (Marwick 117), which can be daunting to the Twitter user but also be used to one’s advantage. There are many different perspectives on the kinds of tweets on the internet. Factors such as censorship, the intended audience, and the appeal to multiple audiences are all taken into consideration while tweeting. This is important to Twitter users because they do not want to be chastised for a specific tweet that was posted but then shared to an unintended audience that does not agree with the user’s views.</p>
<p>While the knowledge of having an intended audience is very important for successful Twitter users, the ability to navigate multiple twitter communities also comes into play when focusing on identity. The phenomenon of context collapse describes how the requirement to display a, “verifiable, singular identity makes it impossible to differ self-presentation strategies, creating tension as diverse groups of people flock to social network sites (boyd, 2008)” (Marwick 122). The public can not tell the difference between self-promotion and commercialization versus one’s authentic self and personal expression. Erving Goffman highlights the interesting analogy between twitter users and actors, for each tweet is a performance intended for a specific audience and group of people, especially noting the fact that, “self-presentation is collaborative” (Marwick 123). Just the way an actor can not perform without an audience, a twitter user can not post a tweet without a group of people to see and interact with it. This public presentation of various narrative can lead to criticism, “encourage social norms” (Marwick 123), and provoke an unwanted reputation for a given user. These consequences of tweeting reinforce the idea of, “’impression management’” (Marwick 123), but also sheds a light on the relationship between social media and identity and how people can accidentally create an unwanted identity for themselves.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As online social networking sites are expanding their popularity, a phenomenon termed “Facebook envy” seems to be on the rise (Appel, 2015). The frustration of logging on to Facebook and being flooded with endless pictures, status updates and friends’ notifications showing what seems to be their perfect lives is one way to describe Facebook envy. This problem has been faced by all Facebook users since 2006 yet still, there is very few research investigating how envy can lead to many other very real physiological effects. Envy and jealousy go hand and hand with depression, yet little is known about the mechanisms underlying this connection. In the “Journal of Social &amp; Clinical Psychology, Vol. 34” a quasi-experimental study entitled, “Social Comparison, Envy, and Depression on Facebook” discusses how Facebook is a high-risk environment for depressed individuals and investigates the severity to which envy harms Facebooks 1 billion users.</p>
<p>In this study, depressed and non-depressed individuals were asked to describe their current levels of self-esteem and were then assigned and compared to a specific Facebook profile. These profiles were either attractive or unattractive and each participant compared themselves to the owner of the profile they were assigned and they reported their resulting feelings. I am sure each feeling was different than the other, yet feelings of envy were the most popular among all test subjects. The original hypothesis for this experiment was that the depressed individuals were expected to feel inferior and more envious, particularly when paired up with an attractive Facebook profile (Appel, 2015). The experiment was also expected to demonstrate how envy can be correlated with low self-esteem, and depressiveness in social comparison.</p>
<p>Social comparison on Facebook is an ongoing process that appears to be the major cause in online envy. This is all a result of Facebooks impression management which allows its users to select, edit and post pictures that misrepresent the truth behind each user’s life (Appel, 2015). This study does a fantastic job in showing how envy is created and why it is harmful. The results were written down, participants were compared to one another and it turns out that resulting envy was higher after seeing an attractive profile. Also, among depressed participants the jealousy experienced was higher than any other. Both results yielded p-values well below zero which gives us strong evidence to conclude that when depressed individuals meet Facebooks misrepresented profiles, the result is in fact envy.</p>
<p>We know by now that Facebook’s boastful atmosphere makes it a very hostile environment for depressed individuals (Appel, 2015).  The results of this experiment shed a new light on the mechanisms underlying the connection between depression and Facebook envy. With this new information, Facebook and many other social networks alike should realize the dangers their users face on a daily basis. Since online social media are already a part of most people’s lives today, interventions must take place soon in order to silence the dangers surrounding the media.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the peer-reviewed article,<em> Social Networking Sites in Romantic Relationships: Attachment, Uncertainty, and Partner Surveillance on Facebook</em>, scholars address how social media sites, particularly Facebook, affect romantic relationships both on- and offline. By accepting a person’s friend request, that person can access your photos, videos, status updates, list of friends, background information, and overall history on the site. Additionally, a friend can post statuses on your profile, message you privately, and also identify a relationship status between the two of you. It is extremely easy to create a Facebook page and with a click of a button, a person can readily access yours and others’ personal information.</p>
<p>Considering there is a large population of Facebook users who post and share their relationship status, many couples are affected by the world of social media. Statistics say that Facebook activities contribute to nearly 20% of divorce cases. “Within romantic relationships, it is common for individuals to stay apprised of the happenings in their partners’ lives. Communication within the couple, an interactive strategy, is the most straightforward way to garner this information, but it is common for partners to employ other information-seeking strategies to learn about their target (the other partner)” (Fox, 2014, p.3). For example, just as a girlfriend can watch from a distance how their boyfriend behaves around others, that girlfriend can just as easily gather information on her boyfriend through pictures he may post, conversations he may have, and pictures that he has liked or commented on. People who struggle with trust issues and jealousy tend to be the people who are most likely to “stalk” not only their partner’s profiles, but also profiles their partner is friends with. Through this kind of online surveillance, many couples either feel more secure in their relationship or more frequently, undergo serious complications.</p>
<p>Two main theories that tend to fuel online relationship “stalking” are the theory of relational uncertainty and the theory of attachment, which scholars, Fox and Warber, delve deeply into. “If a partner is unsure about the target’s feelings or intentions&#8230;the partner experiencing uncertainty may explore the content of the target’s profile to determine what the target is doing and who they are interacting with so that the partner can alleviate uncertainty about the relationship” (Fox, 2014, p.4). Not only is uncertainty problematic throughout the duration of the relationship, but it lingers after the breakup as well. Even if a couple physically separates, they are likely to still remain “friends” on Facebook. “This lingering connection—as well as access to the ex-partner’s post-breakup experiences via Facebook posts and pictures—may foster feelings of uncertainty about the relationship after dissolution”(Fox, 2014, p.4). Some partners may interpret this “connection” as hope that they may one day rekindle what they once had. This kind of person is likely to continuously monitor their ex-partner’s profile for clues about the ex’s relational ambitions and intentions. The theory of attachment is similar in that it revolves around a sense of anxiety. Scholars say that there are four distinct attachment styles, which include secure, preoccupied, dismissing, and fearful individuals. All of these qualities directly affect how a partner reacts to their significant other’s profile and how deeply they will investigate that profile.</p>
<p>While social networking sites have the potential to degrade relationship satisfaction, they can also keep a couple’s relationship alive, especially in cases of long-distance relationships. Platforms like Skype, FaceTime, Snapchat, and Google Chat allow partners to talk face to face, which can really enhance communication and a sense of connection between partners. Other sites like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter create outlets for couples to post pictures and videos together and write messages to one another. Furthermore, making a relationship “Facebook official” can send a message to others that you are in a committed relationship and can prevent others from romantically approaching both you and your partner.</p>
<p>Overall, its important to use social networking sites carefully when involved in a relationship. “The significance and potential effects of monitoring current and former romantic partners on Facebook”(Fox, 2014, p.6) has revolutionized the way people create and maintain relationships. While many couples have let social media negatively impact their relationship, some have found that it facilitates communication and support. If Facebook is creating conflict in your relationship, there is one easy solution and that is to reduce usage.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is no doubt that social media plays an enormous role in people’s, mainly teens, lives today. The innumerable amount of social media sites that exist allow today’s youth to feel a sense of connectedness and individuality. However, researchers are beginning to look at the shocking fact that although users are compelled in such a way, the complete opposite is occurring. More, now than ever, social media users are possessing less of a sense of individuality that they ever have before (Andsager, 2014). As if that is not scary enough, these users typically do not even realize that they are being influenced to act, look, or be a certain way. The underlying urges to be a clone of society’s ideal man/woman are causing impressionable teens to fall victim to body dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>In the 1980’s anorexia nervosa and other similar eating disorders became recognized health issues for young girls (Andsager, 2014). More than 30 years later, such eating disorders have become massive health problems for society. Not only has the magnitude of the disorders changed but so have their victims; now it is not unusual for males to be battling the same disorders as females (Andsager, 2014). The article states that factors such as sexual orientation and gender roles need to be taken into consideration when searching for the cause of the eating disorder but at the root of it all is the unnatural and unbearable amounts of social pressure that today’s youth are faced with daily, especially on social media sites (Andsager, 2014). Although males are battling eating disorders and body dissatisfaction just as much as females, in terms of such disorders stemming from social media, females are more abundant. This is due to the fact that there is a generally higher percentage of females that use social media sites (Andsager, 2014).</p>
<p>A quote from the article that truly illustrates the level to which society has sunk and may explain why teens, mostly females, have disorders and dissatisfaction is “[It] has not been physically possible for the idealized U.S. female body to become much thinner in the last 20 years…” (Andsager, 2014). Social media reinforces the need to be as thin as possible because of the ease of access to communities of people that share this belief. Before any form of social media existed, eating disorders and body dissatisfaction were not a well-known issue because teens could not as easily seek out positive reinforcement in their quest for thinness. In today’s world when anything a person wants to find out is one quick Google search away, eating disorders and body dissatisfaction is through the roof. The existence of “Thinspiration” boards on Pinterest and @Perfect_Women profiles on Instagram and Twitter are huge perpetrators. All of the different versions of social pressures on those three popular social media sites were found in one simple search and were accompanied by a multitude of others just like it. Therefore, young females need to recognize the adverse effects of social media and keep them in mind when on such sites. By doing so, users would be less manipulated into believing that they need to look like someone else and accept and love who they are.</p>

From football to baseball to basketball to hockey to soccer to bowling to golf to tennis and even lacrosse, which has recently grown in popularity in the United States, sporting events are available for viewers to watch on a daily basis. Of course, this is nothing new. Sports have played a crucial role in the United States for decades. However, social media and the role it plays in connection to sports is relatively new. Popular social networking apps such as Facebook, Twitter, and Snapchat make an effort to keep their viewers updated with what is going on in the wide world of sports. While these social networking companies understand that sports have a tremendous cultural impact, they also understand that they have something to gain in making sports-related news so readily available. So, what exactly do these social networking companies have to gain by making sports news so accessible?</p>
<p>According to Dr. Jon Dart (2014, p. 529) of Leeds Metropolitan University, “the media has been a significant and constant companion in the development of professional sport with the latest stage of neoliberal capitalism adapting to, and exploiting, new media technologies to increase profits.” Economics is, largely, about consumer tastes. These tastes, in turn, contribute to consumer demand which tells major media corporations what to supply on their networks. Social networking companies have come to this realization. Hence, these companies monitor their members’ preferences. From here, these sites sell this information to media corporations. These corporations analyze the information and find out what the vast majority of consumers are interested in viewing. If consumers happen to be interested in viewing a Pittsburgh Steelers game, then most of the networks will air the Steelers game. It is no wonder that “new media technologies are not changing the nature of sport, but [are instead] making it more capitalist” (Dart, 2014, p. 530).</p>
<p>This capitalism has been “evident [since] the turn of the century when large media companies began to take ownership of sports teams, with Ted Turner’s 1976 purchase of the Atlanta Braves (MLB) being among the first” (Dart, 2014, p. 531). Other well-known media corporations such as Disney, Cablevision, and News Corporation have been or are still connected to professional sports. Disney founded the NHL’s Anaheim Ducks in 1993 and sold the franchise in 2005, Cablevision purchased the NBA’s New York Knicks and the NHL’s New York Rangers in 1997 and 1995, respectively, and News Corporation purchased the MLB’s Los Angeles Dodgers in 1998 and sold the team in 2004 (Dart, 2014, p. 531). The primary motive for these media companies in purchasing professional sports franchises is, as Dart (2014, p. 531) writes, for these companies to take control of “a greater level of any media related profit.” Often times, these media companies are able to reap the rewards of owning popular sports franchises. Yet, there are instances when these corporations recognize that there is greater benefit in “unload[ing] their sports assets” to “global super rich” clients (Dart, 2014, p. 531).</p>
<p>Moreover, a connection exists between professional sports, social media, and economics. The association between the three is one that has changed the “dynamic between sports fans, athletes, clubs, governing bodies, and mainstream media” (Dart, 2014, p. 528). This change has been positive in that it benefits social media companies, media corporations, and sports fans playing the role of everyday consumers. Social media companies gain by selling information about their members’ preferences to media corporations. Media corporations analyze this information and show highly-demanded games that will generate the greatest possible profit. As a result, sports fans get to enjoy games that they are thoroughly interested in viewing. Therefore, the bond between sports, social media, and economics has positively altered the relationship between sports fans, athletes, franchises, and media companies. This relationship is one in which everyone involved profits.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have we really reached a world that we might have to start using social Media to enhance our learning? Technology has already changed the way kids are learning so I couldn’t imagine kids using social media to learn. Using social media to learn would be very hard to do because kids most likely do not even focus on the work they would be reading up on their news feeds and talking to friends, but in the same senses I feel that kids would absorb information if it was laid out in social media. If your class was set up as a twitter feed I’m sure many kids would have such an easy time navigating through the work. It would be very interesting to see someone try to set a class up like that, or even if it was set up as Facebook.</p>
<p>But social media can be used in many other different ways for learning. Like in the article “Twitter for teaching: Can social media be used to enhance the process of learning?” Chris Evans does research to see if Twitter helps enhances the process of learning, but he uses students who have never used twitter before. It is interesting to see students who haven’t used twitter before become introduced to it in an educational way.</p>
<p>Evans has the students interact with their tutor over twitter using hashtags so that it is easy for the tutors to be able to go and look at what each student is asking. Evans asks in his research if this replaces kids being able to go to class, which he showed that it doesn’t cause even though the students question or concern might be answered, it can never replace the act of walking in to a class and sitting down for a lecture. Social media can never replace the act of going in to a classroom and having a face to face interaction with a teacher or professor.</p>
<p>Evans studied many different aspects of twitter and educations and he figured out that yes it did help students get more evolved and engage in what they were learning. But you will never be able to replace the classroom, social media will be able to help enhance learning. But I don’t think it will ever replace it.</p>
<p>This is something that as my generation gets older should start paying attention to because there might be a day where our kids don’t even go and sit in a class room. They will be learning everything online. They might not even know what a text book is because they will most likely be caring around a tablet or some technological devices that holds all their information that they need.</p>
<p>Our parents telling us how they remember a day without all this technology, we will be saying to our kids how we remember the days of text books and sitting in classrooms. At some point though I think someone will need to step in and make sure that the idea of sitting in a class room remains that way. Because we don’t want future generations not learning how to socialize in person and not getting those learning experiences that we get.</p>
<p>The movement of technology needs to start slowing down and we need to start looking at how much time we spend already looking at a screen. Its unhealthy and the last thing I would want is to be taking classes all online and using social media to help.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Snapchat has quickly become one of the leading social media sites that people use throughout their everyday lives. Although people of all ages use Snapchat, teenagers and others in their early twenties make up most of the user population. With this being the case, the NBA and NFL among other professional sports leagues have decided to bring their own featured content for the users of Snapchat to watch. On days when there is an important sporting event going on such as the MLB playoffs or NBA finals, Snapchat will let users that attend any of these events post real time videos from their phones to the events “My Story”. Snapchat users from all around the world can then watch these snaps in real time to witness the plays and sounds of each event. Snapchat is proving to be the place where teens and other users can get videos and photos that take them closer to sports. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The article that I read discussed why sports fans are using Snapchat for their sports content as opposed to other social media sites such as Facebook or Twitter. Based on my encounters with each of these apps, Snapchat is more easily navigable than any other social media site. While Facebook or Twitter might have one video of a touchdown or amazing play, Snapchat usually has well over 100 seconds of footage if the sporting event has a My Story. With one click of the button short clips of pre-game tailgates,national anthem, fans cheering in the stands, and plays from the game come across the screen without any clicking out or loading another video. With teenagers being labeled as impatient, Snapchat fits the mold perfectly as it is the most effective and quickest way to make yourself feel closer to the actual events of each sport. The article considers that unpredictability is a reason that fans use Snapchat as opposed to Twitter or Facebook. Sports can take a turn in a matter of seconds and one play can change the whole game. The author says that, “the ephemerality of the platform can be alluring. In contrast to Facebook, Twitter, or other social media platforms where a post can live forever, one can cheer when your team scores without worrying about looking dumb if they end up losing,” (Constine, 2014, p.1). On social media websites like Twitter or Facebook, users usually wait until after the event is over to post celebratory things about their teams win because they do not want to jinx or speak too soon. Snapchat is an app that lets people show events happening in real time so this problem does not occur. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With Snapchat being occupied by teenagers and people in their twenties, it will continue to be at the forefront of social media usage and maybe even surpass sites like Twitter and Facebook. Teenagers look to Snapchat and will continue to look to Snapchat to keep up to date with sporting events. With the success that Snapchat has had with leagues like the MLB, NBA, or NFL, it will be only a matter of time before others start showing their content to the users of Snapchat. </span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Technology has come a long way. The learning process that we all once knew has developed into a full virtual experience in such little time. If you hated interpreting those geographic maps in your textbook, you’re going love what the future holds. With the creation of Google Earth, Google put education first and foremost in its aims to bring learning to the next stage. Google Earth lets people carry out a countless number of actions unlike all ways before it. Each bringing a slew of benefits. One example allows people to look back on and notice cultural changes. While this is good for many, it’s especially good for scientists and historians who can further observe and analyze research using findings provided on the new platform. Another gives students visions of places they have learned about but are unable to travel to. So What? Being able to see the world in a lens, right in front of you allows people to see things that may no longer exist. Thus making it history. It can also help solve problems as to why an incident may have occurred in an easy and interactive way. Many have found Google Earth to be intruding and have already begun using the new technology in their life. Whether that be for their own use, in the office or on the go. Technology has come so far already, but many are predicting this is just the start.</p>
<p>Education is a big part in society and Google Earth has taken learning to the next level. A better education can mean a lot. Buy why? Ultimately it makes the next generation smarter. Which then sets the bar even higher for the next generation. Thus ensuring technology’s expansion. Google Earth has contributed highly to the understanding of recent history and the exploration of other countries. Prior to Google Earth, the methods of learning geography were not on par. Nowadays, being able to virtually navigate and see all angles and not just photos supply’s countless benefits to one’s overall learning experience. According to (Williams and Davinroy, 2015), “when students see for themselves the relationships between location, culture, and events, they become more engaged with the material we present.” This line is significant because it perfectly summarizes what Google Earth is all about. Throughout the article the idea that students absorb more knowledge using this method of learning is repeatedly addressed. Many find this concept interesting and agree, however, there are still a select bunch that prefer old style learning. According to (Williams and Davinroy, 2015), learning Earth Science has become a totally new experience, in addition, understanding Geography, history and even language classes have been impacted.</p>
<p>While Education is important, Google Earth can also strengthen one’s interpreting skills. Two of the most important ones being observing and analyzing. By constantly browsing on Google Earth, one is contextually observing what’s on screen and furthering their analyzing skills by making interpretations of the place in which they’re viewing. According to (Williams and Davinroy, 2015), with Google Earth at one’s side, students are more motivated to go explore the world, even when it’s not for a mandatory assignment. They’re also more likely to retain the information from the course because absorbing information from visuals has been proven easier than that of books. So what? The more locations and geographical features someone is exposed to, the larger the odds he/she will relate what they saw to something in the future. Ultimately, it has the power to broaden one’s mind with a variety of places around the world, solve mysteries, and even expand upon one’s skills thus lasting a life time.</p>
<p>Google Earth is giving people the chance to virtually discover the world through a single application. It’s teaching people long-lasting skills such as observation and analyzation, in addition to improving education in many different ways. The useful tools we have now that weren’t possible in the past are becoming successively better than the generation before. Google Earth opens up many opportunities by letting us explore any place whenever we want at a glance. As discussed in class, it amazes many to see the world’s growth in technology and it’s making for a better and enhanced future.</p>
