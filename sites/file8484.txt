								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Instagram is one of the most popular forms of social media that exists. The platform of this specific social media focuses solely on the posting of pictures with different filters and captions which are seen by a user’s followers who are able to like and comment on the posted photo. Although Instagram has a lot of positive aspects such as allowing people to be connected to family, friends, and strangers around the world, there are still numerous adverse effects that make the app not as advantageous as it is intended to be. In the article “The Instagram Effect: How the Psychology of Envy Drives Consumerism,” author, Lane Anderson lays out on the table all of the destructive consequences that stem from the thriving site. Anderson categorizes the most prominent aspects as “peer pressure,” “reality check,” and most importantly, “comparison.” Comparison is by far the most emphasized point in this article. Anderson interviewed multiple people and quoted them throughout the article and without fail, each person mentioned something about the envy that is typically instilled in majority of Instagram’s users.</p>
<p>A quote that embodies the overall message of this article was said by Andrea Mouritsen, a well-known blogger turned Instagrammer. In regards to “famous” bloggers receiving free gifts just because they are well-known on the Internet, Mouritsen said, “There are photos of (a popular blogger) pushing a $1,800 stroller while a professional photographer follows them. Suddenly, I feel like my stroller is a piece of crap, and it puts me in a state of annoyance.” This quote is so vital to relaying the author’s message because it shows how Instagram is being misused. Instagram is supposed to make the users feel unified with the people that they follow; whether people are following their friends, family, or a superstar, everyone is on the same level. However, when situations like the one above occur users are no longer on the same level. Instead, people are driven apart and it is often a person’s own fault for allowing this to happen.</p>
<p>This is not to say that comparison is always an awful thing. Sometimes it can be a constructive component that people utilize in order to better him- or herself or life. Comparison changes sides when people allow it to morph into envy and allow it to affect their life.</p>
