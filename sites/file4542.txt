								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Digital Media Assistant Tony Dalton recently produced a video documentary for the Class of 1960 for their 50 year reunion.  Throughout 2009-2010, Tony met with alumni, conducted interviews, gathered and photographed memorabilia, and scoured College archives for items in the <em>Chiarla</em> and <em>Weekly</em> to represent life on campus between 1956 and 1960.  The result is an impressive and entertaining documentary titled <em>Band of Brothers and a Few Sisters</em>.  In working closely with alumni from the Class of &#8217;60, Tony most enjoyed &#8220;listening to their stories and having the opportunity to retell them.&#8221;</p>
<p>The retrospective video premiered during Reunion Weekend and got rave reviews.  The Class of &#8217;60 loved the DVD and invited Tony to join them for their reunion dinner.  Jenny McLarin, Director of Alumni Affairs, shares that after introducing the film and showing a short clip, Tony received &#8220;tumultuous applause!&#8221;  He also received a surprise from the class:  a certificate of appreciation and a director&#8217;s chair with his name and two starts on the back!  It is a tradition during to present a class gift to alumni returning to campus for a reunion, and with this DVD, the Class of 1960 and Tony have set a new standard!</p>
