								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I know I am technically supposed to postpone my judgment until after analyzing a piece of text, but as I started reading a chapter from the book, Born Digital by John G Palfrey I couldn’t help but notice that the chapter I chose to read was called “Pirates”. So as I began reading silently too myself, all I could think was, “This author is crazy, is he really attempting to call my generation pirates, ones who lie and steal and kill?” Turns out Palfrey did a pretty good job in persuading me,  I hate to admit it but yeah, we are all pirates when it comes to the digital world whether we accept it or not.</p>
<p>You may ask yourself why this is, and think that you do nothing wrong while on the internet and that may be the case, like it is for many people. However, the digital world has changed faster than anyone could have ever imagined and it simply wasn’t ready for the wave of our generation to step in. Palfrey says regarding the digital natives, “With so many forms of media available in digital formats, Digital Natives are breaking new creative ground” (Palfrey, 131). My judgment immediately kicked in again and I thought to myself, “Hey, he’s finally saying something nice about my generation!” All that we do in our daily lives, like surf the web, listen to music, or socialize with millions of other people were unimaginable just a few years ago and this new technology that we were born into allows us to grow up in a creative atmosphere. Here, Palfrey states, “Creativity, is the upside of this brave new world of digital media” (Palfrey, 132). But with every upside there is always a counterpart. The downsides to this atmosphere sometimes even outweigh those upsides. A detrimental downside is today’s violation of copy right laws. Palfrey claims that the vast majority of Digital Natives are breaking copy right laws on a regular basis. The emergence of new technologies and the easy access to violate copy right laws took everyone by surprise and led corporations to conclude that something had to be done to protect these laws and to punish those who do not cooperate with them. In doing so leads our growing digital era to a cross roads. Are the digital natives creative and helpful or destructive and relentless?</p>
<p>Pirates are neither creative nor helpful, so in essence Palfrey’s claim is that our generation is destructive, but why? The chapter “Pirates” discussed a controversy I found to be very interesting regarding the epidemic of file sharing that occurred in the early 2000s. Napster was the head dog in this battle that eventually caused major corporations to re think copy right laws. You may have heard of Napster before but for those that haven’t, it was a new form a software developed so music could be shared easily and for free over the internet. What entailed from this was that the sales of CD’s and albums sharply declined, devastating the economy of the music industry. Aside from shortages in sales, Napster and many other “P2P” sites committed large scale copy right infringements. No matter how hard the music industry try’s to shut down the P2P file sharing sites they will never die because their popularity among the Digital Natives is bigger than law itself. Now a day’s how many people actually are buying CD’s and albums? Not many, as social norms drive this ongoing piracy. To fully comprehend this file sharing epidemic we have to understand social norms which regulate human behavior more than anything. We were all taught at a young age to comply with social norms of all sorts, such as “sharing nicely” or “saying please and thank you”. Napster kick started this wave of piracy among the Digital natives from a very early age making copy right infringement the “normal thing to do”. Also having not learned about them from an early age, the majority of Digital Natives are very confused about the intricacies of copy right laws. A necessary solution is to teach the importance of copy right at a young age and not strangle the creativity of our worlds Digitals Natives by strengthening the laws themselves.</p>
