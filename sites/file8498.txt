								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In society today I am almost positive that most teenagers can’t even fathom a day without social media and their personal cellphones. We spend half our day on our phones looking through social media and texting such as Instagram, Facebook, and SnapChat. A new and upcoming social media app, Yik Yak allows users to post anonymously thoughts and comments about anything they please. It was created in 2013 by Tyler Droll and Brooks Buffington who were recent graduates at Furman University. According to Mahler, Droll and Buffington, “came up with the ideas after realizing that there were only a handful of popular Twitter accounts at Furman…they hoped to created a more democratic social media network, one where users didn’t need a large number of followers or friends to have their posts read widely” (Mahler, 2015, p.1). This is a valid reason because social media today is all about likes and how many followers you have. On Snapchat I hear people rave about how many people have seen their story and on Instagram how many likes they got within a certain time span. Not having to make a Yik Yak profile allows anyone and everyone around your area to see your thoughts not just people who follow you or you may know personally. While it is a good way to get your thoughts out anonymously it is used way too many times to put out negative comments about people or things.</p>
<p>In this article Jonathan Mahler interviewed a professor who filed multiple complaints about inappropriate things said about her on Yik Yak that her students posted about her. Unfortunately, nothing was done about it because the selling feature of Yik Yak is that ever post is completely anonymous making it impossible to find the person responsible for the inappropriate posts. Colleges have no control to students from accessing Yik Yak because if they just block access through their Wi-Fi networks students can easily just use their cell service which colleges have no control over. This is a huge issue because today so many people are targeted through cyber bullying. Having Yik Yak completely anonymous has its ups and downs, it allows people to ask questions that may be too uncomfortable to ask if their identity was exposed to the pubic. However cyber attacks that happened to the professor at Michigan are much easier to execute with rarely any consequences.</p>
