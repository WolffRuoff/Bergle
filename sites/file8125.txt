								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The concept of google as a whole has always been fascinating to me. You can have access to all of the information in the world at any time. However through this activity i began to realize the differences in the type of information one would search for. For example , as an active member on social media, it would be safe to assume that I could find myself on google. Also as an athlete I thought there might be some information on me. When I actually googled myself there was thousands of pictures of different Rosie Martins.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When I put more specific information into the search category I noticed that more information came up. For example Rosie Martin Ramapo basketball had more information about me personally. This brings me into my first category of information which is more personal information.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>With personal information unless you are famous there will be little to no information about your personal life unless you are very specific. This means that anyone who googles me will basically have no concept of who I am. Just out of curiosity I decided to google something completely random that probably not many people really would google. I picked Arbor day. Thousands upon thousands of articles came up about arbor day. However when I typed in a specific foundation on arbor day less information came up. To summarize what I learned through googling myself is that with personal information it is better to google specific topics. In general information it is better to keep the searches general to obtain more articles. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> One thing that I also noticed was that the more successful a person was meant the more information they have about themselves on google. In my free write I wrote about how in order to be successful I wanted to have a great job and a happy life. In actuality I think the true measure of success to have done something great enough for people to be able to google it. I also think that having this google identity will immediately change people’s perceptions or first impressions of you. For example I said before how if you googled me nothing would come up. Now when people google me they would be able to find something great and this would mean that I would have done something to<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>become successful.</span></p>
