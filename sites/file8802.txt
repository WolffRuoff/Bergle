								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Social media is a platform which allows the teens of today’s world to communicate with other people from all around the world and from all walks of life. In theory, social media is a positive mechanism that brings all people closer together. However, in reality, the complete opposite is true. As explained in the YouTube video “How social media is affecting teens,” the youth of today are being harmed by too much social media interaction. The ways in which they are being affected does not refer to one’s impaired eye sight from staring at a screen for too long or obesity from reduced activity. Rather, this destruction is attributed to the desire to be famous (The National, 2014).</p>
<p>Researcher Yalda Uhls conducted a few experiments on teenagers in Los Angeles and elementary school students in Canada (The National, 2014). The basis of the experiment was to get the kids to write down a personalized list of the top 16 lifetime goals and aspirations that they valued the most in order of importance (The National, 2014). When this experiment was conducted in the past the 15th goal, which can be assumed to be almost the least important, was typically fame. Uhls’ results were the complete opposite during the most recent version of the similar experiment; the majority of teens that were involved in this study had fame as their number one want in life (The National, 2014). According to Uhls, this sudden desire to be famous is closely linked to the increased use of social media today. This escalation in time spent being engaged with some nature of technology is not allowing teens to have time for reflection whether it be of oneself or another person. In turn, this causes these technology-driven teens to have less empathy for others which subsequently leads to a generation full of people who do not care about the well-being of others (The National, 2014). This statistic is just another aspect in which social media is damaging society.</p>
<p>Obviously teens are not spending 100% of their time on social media sites. Whenever their nose is not in the phone however, they are sometimes mesmerized by a program that is on television. These programs go hand in hand with social media and can be used to explain why today’s teens have such an overambitious want to be famous (The National, 2014). Some of the most popular television shows from the past decade deal with people being liked and becoming famous. For example, <em>Hannah Montana</em> was about a girl who was an average teenager by day and an iconic pop star by night and <em>American Idol</em> was about average people auditioning in front of judges and competing against other contestants to be recognized as a wonderful singer (The National, 2014). Although both of these shows no longer exist, they are certainly what today’s teens grew up watching which makes them relevant to the issue at hand.</p>
<p>In the long run, it can be argued that parents are the culprits to be blamed for this unrealistic infatuation that teens possess (Marshall, 2009). More and more often today you see children who can’t walk or talk yet but are toying with an iPad and navigating through the device better than most adults would be able to. Parents who shove technology in the faces of children just so they will stop bothering them are the ones who are kick starting the obsession with social media and therefore, the desire to be famous. If children were taught that being famous is not everything from the beginning then society would not be faced with a bunch of young teens who only care about how many likes their selfie got on Instagram.</p>
