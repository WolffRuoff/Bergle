They then applied those skills to their own research projects. Emmaus High AP history students will come to the library at the end of March for a day of history research. Jefferson and Roosevelt Elementary students will visit the library as part of the Campus Connect program, to participate in an information scavenger hunt and web evaluation tutorial.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>Libraries Take Charge of Their E-books<\/strong><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>For our readers not immersed in the daily life of librarianship, it may come as a surprise that library e-books are a hotly contested issue. Libraries have long been frustrated by the inability to own e-books outright. Often vendors, the middle men, only offer the option of renting the books. When the lease is up, the books disappear, unless they are paid for again.<\/p>\n<p>This is due to change. The\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.muhlenberg.edu\/library\/about\/publications\/scuttlebutt\/www.thedigitalshift.com\/2012\/03\/ebooks\/large-california-consortium-joins-movement-toward-library-ebook-ownership\/\">Digital Shift<\/a>\u00a0reports that several libraries in California are joining forces to remove the middle man from the e-book process. Libraries will go directly to those publishers who will agree to let them &#8220;truly own, not rent&#8221; e-books.<\/p>\n<p>This model is the brain-child of a small group of public libraries in Colorado. The model&#8217;s adoption in California means attention being given it on a national scale. Lyrasis, the consortium that Muhlenberg College is part of, is now investigating the model.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>Infomaniac Tip<\/strong><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Sign Up for Free\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.nitle.org\/digital_scholarship_seminar_registration.php\">NITLE<\/a>\u00a0Webinar<\/strong><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>In honor of the annual Day of Digital Humanities, NITLE&#8217;s next digital scholarship seminar,&#8221;Digital Pedagogy,&#8221; will take place on the Day of DH, March 27, 2012 at 1 pm EDT. In this seminar, two experienced practitioners of Digital Pedagogy will share their experiences with digital teaching and learning and consider the implications for digital pedagogy.
