<p>Last week, we started The Uniform Project with one of Muhlenberg&#8217;s oldest men&#8217;s sports, track and field. Today, we look at one of the oldest women&#8217;s sports, field hockey, which made its debut in 1959 shortly after the College went coeducational.</p>
<p>Those early Mule teams were known for their incredible success, going 54-2-4 in their first nine seasons. During that time they wore the classic tunics, but in the early 1970s they switched to collared shirts and kilts.</p>
<p>Women&#8217;s lacrosse became a varsity sport in Muhlenberg in 1984, and for many of the years since, lacrosse and field hockey have shared the uniforms pictured below.</p>
<p>Our next project will be on Thursday, July 12. What team should we do? Let us know!</p>

<p>We&#8217;ll start this week with one of the oldest sports at Muhlenberg, track and field. The men started competing in 1910 and the women in 1988. From shorts and t-shirts to speed suits, below is a gallery of more than 100 years of Mule track and field uniforms. Enjoy!</p>

			<p><em>With the spring sports season just about wrapped up, we will be taking a closer look at Muhlenberg’s senior student-athletes.</em></p>
<p><em>We conclude the senior profiles series with Part Two of men’s and women’s track and field. <a title="Senior Profiles: Track and Field (part 1)" href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/2012/05/17/senior-profiles-track-and-field/">Part One </a>ran yesterday.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><strong><img class="alignleft" title="Andrew Henry" src="http://muhlenberg.edu/images/main/athletics/men/crosscountry/hs/xc11/henryhs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" />Andrew Henry</strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s something most people don’t know about you that they might find interesting? </strong>I have a really good memory when it comes to schoolwork, so I find myself spending a little more time watching Netflix and not so much time studying. That can upset some of teammates who spend a little more time in the library than I do.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your most memorable Muhlenberg track and field memory? </strong>Winning the 800 indoors at the home meet my sophomore year.</p>
<p><strong>How have you been able to manage your time between classes and being on the track team to make the Dean’s List the past six semesters? </strong>I wouldn&#8217;t know what to do with myself from 3:00 until 6:00 on a daily basis if it wasn&#8217;t for track and cross country. As distance runners, we pretty much practice year round, so having such a set schedule has allowed me to manage my time very well. Every day I know I pretty much have to go to class during the day, practice during the afternoon, and then get whatever work I need to get done after dinner.</p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans? </strong>I plan on applying to veterinary school this summer and working at the Lehigh Valley Zoo during my time off. My goal is to go to the University of Pennsylvania and go on to become a zoo vet.</p>
<p><strong>What’s William Lowrey like off the track? </strong>Fun loving. Will is a great friend and roommate. In the last four years, Will and I have gotten to spend a lot of time together, and honestly I could not have asked for a better partner in crime.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><strong>William Lo<img class="alignleft" title="William Lowrey" src="http://muhlenberg.edu/images/main/athletics/men/crosscountry/hs/xc11/lowreyhs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" />wrey</strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>When did you start growing your mustache? </strong>I started growing my mustache during cross country my junior year. The cross country team always lets our facial hair grow out during championship season, however, I wanted to get a jump start on the facial hair growth because my beard does not grow overnight, to say the least. After a while, my mustache just started coming in pretty nicely, and I began receiving compliments so I just kept it.</p>
<p><strong>Being from Vermont, what’s your favorite Ben and Jerry’s flavor? </strong>That&#8217;s a tough one, but I’ve got to go with Cherry Garcia. It’s great ice cream named after a great musician.</p>
<p><strong>What’s the best part about running the steeplechase? </strong>It seems to go by really quickly. I&#8217;ve never enjoyed running the flat 3,000 indoors or the 5,000 because they seem like monotonous, painful slogs. Like cross country, however, as you progress through the steeple you&#8217;re thinking about new challenges that lie ahead of you. It takes your mind off of the pain your body is in and allows you to get competitive and race.</p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans? </strong>I’m not sure right now.</p>
<p><strong>What kind of person is Andrew Henry? </strong>Andy is just an overall great guy. He&#8217;s the go-to guy whenever anyone needs to talk or just wants someone to hang out with. There are a lot of smart, hard-working kids on the cross country team that place their education on a pedestal, and while Andy is one of them, his work is always secondary to his friends and teammates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><strong><img class="alignleft" title="Alex Price" src="http://www.muhlenberg.edu/images/main/athletics/men/trackandfield/hs/track11/pricehs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" />Alex Price</strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>How have you improved on the track since your freshman year? </strong>I think I&#8217;ve learned to race a lot smarter and have gotten better with knowing my pace. No matter what the conditions are or what lane I get, I know how I should be running.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your most memorable Muhlenberg track and field memory? </strong>It&#8217;s hard to pick just one, so I&#8217;d say our indoor home meets have been some of the most exciting. The field house is so small that having friends and family packed in there cheering you on made it very loud and a really fun experience.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your best off-the-track memory from your time here? </strong>Even when I&#8217;m not running, cheering on my teammates is just as exhilarating. We&#8217;ve got some talented guys out there that are really fun to watch. I&#8217;m definitely going to miss supporting and yelling for them.</p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans? </strong>Starting this fall, I&#8217;m going to be working for Deloitte at their Boston office.</p>
<p><strong>What’s Eric Strouse like as a person? </strong>He&#8217;s definitely a true wildcard on and off the track. When you watch him run you can tell he&#8217;s giving more than 100 percent, so I really respect his passion and fun-loving spirit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><strong><img class="alignleft" title="Peter Rice" src="http://www.muhlenberg.edu/images/main/athletics/men/trackandfield/hs/track11/ricehs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" />Peter Rice</strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>When did you first realize that you were really fast? </strong>I realized I was fast right around the same time I realized I was really, really, ridiculously good-looking&#8230; I actually knew I was fast when I was little, but I didn&#8217;t start seriously running track until my junior year of high school. I really liked the personal challenge, and it was a lot of fun, so I stuck with it. Now I&#8217;m a huge track nerd.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your most memorable Muhlenberg track and field memory? </strong>In my four years, our 4&#215;100, 4&#215;200, and 4&#215;400 relays have had a lot of success, winning a lot of relays at the conference meets, as well as a 4&#215;400 Penn Relays win. I&#8217;ve had a blast running with a bunch of different guys who&#8217;ve all made Muhlenberg a sprint relays dynasty.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your best off-the-track memory from your time here? </strong>My best off-the-track memories are from the week that we come back early for practice before the second semester starts. There are good stories from every “track camp,” but my favorite would have to be our captains ordering Chinese food as our team meal sophomore year. It&#8217;s become a sort of tradition, and there are few things as awesome as seeing $350 worth of catered Chinese food. Yum.</p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans? </strong>After I graduate, I hope to move out west to work at a ski area for a year or two, and then I want to work in advertising or marketing research, which I&#8217;ve had a lot of fun doing in class and as an independent research study during my senior year.</p>
<p><strong>What kind of person is Kyle Sullivan? </strong>Kyle Boogie… I&#8217;ve been on two conference champion relays with Kyle, but he hasn&#8217;t always run track. He started out playing lacrosse, and ran track outdoors during our sophomore year. After a year off, he came back and ran all season this year. I think he brought a refreshing attitude to the track team. Oftentimes, runners are too willing to be hurt. Kyle doesn&#8217;t have a lot of background in track, so he never seemed to care about how his legs felt. If you asked him to run a race, he did it, no questions asked. He has worked his tail off this year, and has made a huge impact on a team that he was only a member of for a year and a half. Plus he&#8217;s going to Columbia next year, so I guess he&#8217;s got to be smart&#8230;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><strong><img class="alignleft" title="Eric Strouse" src="http://www.muhlenberg.edu/images/main/athletics/men/trackandfield/hs/track10/strousehs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" />Eric Strouse</strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s the best part of being on the track team?</strong> I get to run alongside a handful of handsome men wearing short shorts while having engaging conversations about science and life on a daily basis.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your most memorable Muhlenberg track and field memory?</strong> Winning the freshman time trial and watching Stuart Udis run a 1:52 in the 4&#215;800 to win conferences my freshman year.</p>
<p><strong>How have you been able to manage your time between classes and being on the track team to make the Dean’s List the past four semesters?</strong> It&#8217;s not that I am smarter than most people here at Muhlenberg… I have been able to utilize a time machine to balance my incredibly hectic and stressful schedule.</p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans? </strong>If marrying softball star Jennie Finch and being a stay-at-home dad does not work out, I plan on going to dental school</p>
<p><strong>What’s Alex Price like away from the track?</strong> Alex is a great guy with a kind soul, trying to match Mike Baer grade for grade.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><strong><img class="alignleft" title="Kyle Sullivan" src="http://muhlenberg.edu/images/main/athletics/men/lacrosse/hs/mlax11/sullivanhs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" />Kyle Sullivan</strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>How does it feel being a part of the fastest 4&#215;100 team in school history? </strong>We&#8217;re all athletes and have that competitive edge to us, or else we wouldn&#8217;t be here. So with that disclaimer, it feels good to be the best at something. There&#8217;s no doubt in my mind that that record will be broken very soon. That&#8217;s just what happens. If it&#8217;s not broken soon, I&#8217;ll probably have to swing by and have a small chit chat with Coach Hackett to see if everything&#8217;s OK. I also feel lucky that I just so happen to be on the team at the same time as three other very fast sprinters. It was the luck of the draw.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your most memorable Muhlenberg track and field memory? </strong>Probably the cross country regional meet tailgate party we had. Good times. Face paint, body paint, loud music, Italian sausages and running around yelling at our teammates to run faster. All at 10:00 in the morning.</p>

<p><strong>What are your future plans? </strong>I have a civil engineering/land development/surveying internship on Martha&#8217;s Vineyard this summer where I&#8217;ll mostly be doing drafting on a computer. For the next two years I will be going to Columbia University under the 4-2 engineering combined plan where I&#8217;ll be doing civil engineering. After that I&#8217;ll have a bachelor&#8217;s in math and physics from Muhlenberg as well as a bachelor&#8217;s in civil engineering from Columbia, which will hopefully contribute towards the probability of me getting a job.</p>
<p><strong>What kind of teammate is Peter Rice? </strong>I couldn&#8217;t ask for a better teammate. Pete&#8217;s a funny guy, always cracking jokes, laughing loudly, engaging everyone in his antics and never in a bad mood. It&#8217;s great because he&#8217;s also one of the hardest-working teammates I&#8217;ve ever had. He&#8217;s always the one leading the workouts, pushing the other guys, including myself, to go faster and do an extra hill run or two after we&#8217;ve already done eight of them. I think I speak for the whole team when I say Pete is an inspiration for all of us.</p>

			<p><em>With the spring sports season just about wrapped up, we will be taking a closer look at Muhlenberg’s senior student-athletes.</em></p>
<p><em>We conclude the senior profiles series with Part One of men’s and women’s track and field, which competed at the Centennial Conference Championships in early May.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft" title="Melissa Miller" src="http://www.muhlenberg.edu/images/main/athletics/men/trackandfield/hs/track10/millermhs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" />Melissa Miller</strong></p>
<p><strong>How did you get into pole vaulting? </strong>I wanted to try pole vaulting when I first started track my junior year of high school, because my dad was a pole vaulter when he was in high school. He actually held the pole vault record at my high school, and it wasn&#8217;t broken until I started track when my teammate broke it. My grandmother was also a pole vaulter when she was in high school too, so the event just ran in my family. The first day I tried it, I knew that that was the event I wanted to do.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your most memorable Muhlenberg track and field memory? </strong>One of my most memorable track memories was when I lucked out at the outdoor conference meet my freshman year. The weather was pretty bad the day we pole vaulted at F&amp;M, but we started to compete outdoors anyway. I didn&#8217;t have a very good day and got out pretty early on. But then they postponed the meet for a couple hours to try and wait out the storm. After a few hours went by, they decided to move the pole vault into their indoor facilities. So much time had passed since we had stopped pole vaulting that the decision was made to start the competition all over again. That time I advanced farther than I had when we were outdoors and actually tied for eighth place to earn the team a half point. I was really lucky that that happened.</p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans? </strong>For now I&#8217;m moving back home to work and save money to eventually go back to school. The plan right now is to go to grad school for school counseling, preferably in elementary education.</p>
<p><strong>What kind of person is Kimberlee Yalango? </strong>Well, for one thing she&#8217;s the reason I was on the track team here. We met each other the first weekend of our freshmen year and figured out that we were both thinking about being on the team but weren&#8217;t completely committed to it. We decided to try it out together, and now here we are years later. She&#8217;s been an amazing leader for our team, as well as an amazing friend to everyone. She&#8217;s been completely dedicated to the team all of our four years here, and that really shows on and off the track. It&#8217;s an understatement to say that the team will be sad to see her graduate. Kim is my teammate, bus buddy, roommate, best friend and a person that I honestly could not imagine my college experience without.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft" title="Kimberlee Yalango" src="http://muhlenberg.edu/images/main/athletics/men/crosscountry/hs/xc11/yalangohs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" />Kimberlee Yalango</strong></p>
<p><strong>How fulfilling was it winning your first Centennial Conference gold medal with the indoor 4&#215;800 relay this year? </strong>That was without a doubt the highlight of my track and field career because the 4&#215;800 has always been my favorite race. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever been happier to place in a conference meet, especially with the incredible relay team I was placed on. It was extremely fulfilling since the gold got snagged from us at the previous outdoor championships during my anchor leg, and I had never really forgiven myself for it. The gold in indoors was definitely redemption for all of us, and I&#8217;m so grateful I got to enjoy that moment with my teammates and end my career at conference meets on such a high note.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your most memorable Muhlenberg track and field memory? </strong>I think my most memorable track memory would be winning that 4&#215;800 relay or going to the last chance meet at the Armory my sophomore year with the &#8220;Candy Sisters&#8221; of Alex Faust, Jen Lynch and Nicolette Miller to run the distance medley relay. While we broke the school record in a race with only one other team, the laughs and bonding from that trip were my favorite part, and we still reminisce about it to this day. I&#8217;ll make note though that the DMR school record we broke that year got smashed this year by a relay team of extremely talented athletes that you can expect a lot more from in the upcoming years.</p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans? </strong>I am moving down to North Carolina and attending Wake Forest University in the fall for my Master&#8217;s in Counseling.</p>
<p><strong>What kind of person is Mellissa Miller? </strong>Melissa&#8217;s athletic career truly defines the type of person that she is. She has gone through more setbacks than anyone I know, including a case of mono, countless injuries, a semester abroad and, most recently, a torn hamstring. She has had to sit out many meets and seasons, and while most people in her shoes would probably just give up and quit the team, she never did. She is an extremely persistent athlete and individual, and she keeps a positive attitude and makes the most of every situation. I know the team will miss her sense of humor and feisty personality. Not only is she my only fellow senior on the team, but she&#8217;s also my best friend, my bus buddy, my biggest supporter and the reason I&#8217;ve enjoyed the past four years on the track team so incredibly much.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft" title="Michael Baer" src="http://www.muhlenberg.edu/images/main/athletics/men/trackandfield/hs/track11/baerhs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" />Michael Baer</strong></p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s the best part about being a multi-athlete? </strong>The variety. I&#8217;m always getting to work on something new and try something different. If one event isn&#8217;t going well I can channel my frustration into a different event.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s your most memorable Muhlenberg track and field memory? </strong>Scoring my first points as a sophomore in the high hurdles.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s your best off-the-track memory from your time here? </strong>The huge blizzard that shut down the school for two days during my sophomore year. That might have been the last snow day I&#8217;ll ever have&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans? </strong>I am attending the University of Pennsylvania medical school, but beyond that I&#8217;m not sure. I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised to find myself working as an oncologist in the future.</p>
<p><strong>What kind of person is David Kurtis? </strong>For the past couple of years, Dave has been one of the hardest-working people on the team and a great teammate to hurdle with. I think a lot of people on the team look up to Dave because of how hard he worked to improve in the intermediate hurdles, which paid off when he took home a bronze medal at the last conference meet. I&#8217;ll definitely miss questioning him on the utility of Dream Zoo.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft" title="Marc Brookland" src="http://www.muhlenberg.edu/images/main/athletics/men/trackandfield/hs/track11/brooklandhs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" />Marc Brookland</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do you have any superstitions or traditions you do before a big meet? </strong>I always put on and tie my left shoe before my right. I&#8217;ve done that since I started track in middle school.</p>
<p><strong>H</strong><strong>ow does it feel being the school record holder in both the indoor and outdoor triple jump? </strong>It&#8217;s really an honor. Both records were held for a long time and were pretty far distances. I&#8217;m proud to say I&#8217;m the school&#8217;s record holder in both.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your most memorable Muhlenberg track and field memory? </strong>My most memorable moment is a tie between breaking the outdoor record in triple jump and breaking 22 feet in long jump for the first time. They both meant a lot to me.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your best off-the-track memory from your time here? </strong>My best off-the-track memory at Muhlenberg was seeing Michael Ingridson live in concert in Memorial Hall.</p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans? </strong>I&#8217;m not sure right now. Hopefully I get into Drexel&#8217;s graduate program.</p>
<p><strong>What’s Michael Baer like as a captain? </strong>Baer is a great leader. He&#8217;s not that kind of guy who runs around like a cheerleader and tries to motivate his team vocally, but that&#8217;s because he doesn&#8217;t have to. He recognizes that actions speak louder than words, and his intensity and dedication on the track speaks for him. He leaves everything on the track day in and day out. We were lucky to have him lead us throughout the year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft" title="David Kurtis" src="http://www.muhlenberg.edu/images/main/athletics/men/trackandfield/hs/track11/kurtishs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" />David Kurtis</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do you have any hidden or unusual talents? </strong>I can chirp like a cricket.</p>
<p><strong>How did you become a hurdler? </strong>As a freshman in high school I wanted to find an event that I could be the best at on my team. Given that there were no other hurdlers at the time, I took advantage of the opportunity. It also afforded me the chance to spend every day at practice with three senior girls.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your most memorable Muhlenberg track and field memory? </strong>Placing 3rd in the 400 hurdles at the outdoor conference championship my senior year and setting a new personal best.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your best off-the-track memory from your time here? </strong>Seeing Michael Ingridson perform live in Memorial Hall with my buddy Marc Brookland.</p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans? </strong>I will be moving to Chicago after graduation to work for Allstate Insurance.</p>
<p><strong>What’s Marc Brookland like away from track? </strong>About as much fun as zip lining.</p>

			<p><em>With the spring sports season just about wrapped up, we will be taking a closer look at Muhlenberg’s senior student-athletes.</em></p>
<p><em>We continue with softball. Seniors Brittany Blohm and Shelby Smith celebrated Senior Day in style, sweeping Franklin &amp; Marshall, 4-0 and 6-5.</em></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/05/blohmhs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1167" title="blohmhs" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/05/blohmhs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Brittany Blohm</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do you have any hidden or unusual talents? </strong>I am pretty good at playing poker. When I was younger my family told me I should work as a card dealer.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>How much of an accomplishment is it having 100 career hits and ranking fourth in school history in doubles? </strong>I feel very accomplished having 100 career hits and ranking fourth in doubles. I just go up there concentrating on having good at-bats and hitting the ball hard somewhere. That is all that I can control. I really enjoy hitting and helping my team out at the plate. I also know that I am not very fast, so making the career triples list was not going to happen.</p>
<p><strong>Is there one play or at-bat that sticks out in your mind? </strong>A play that sticks out in my mind is when we got the last out of the game at the plate in the Centennial Conference playoffs last year. It was very exciting to make the play and know that we won the game. For an at-bat it would have to be when I hit a grand slam. That was the first one I had ever hit. <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What do you feel are your strengths as a catcher? </strong>My strengths as a catcher are getting along well with umpires (or as my teammates and coaches would say, “flirting” with the umpires), blocking balls in the dirt and being able to call a good game for the pitchers.</p>
<p><strong>What’s the best off-the-field memory from your time here? </strong>My best off-the-field memory from here is all the friends that I have made. They are some of my best friends. I also will miss our team pants talk. These pants are not easy to wear!</p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans? </strong>I am currently applying to grad schools to get my teaching certification in elementary education. I hope to be a teacher soon!</p>
<p><strong>What kind of person is Shelby Smith? </strong>Shelby is a very positive person. She knows how to keep everyone happy, and you rarely see her without a smile on her face. I have enjoyed playing with her the past four years. She is a leader and very versatile player. She is my tanning buddy, and I will miss her “GO Shelby” dance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/05/smithhs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1168" title="smithhs" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/05/smithhs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Shelby Smith</strong><em></em></p>
<p><strong>What’s something most people don’t know about you that they might find interesting? </strong>I have been coming to Muhlenberg softball camps since I was 9 years old. That means that I have been coming to this campus or the Muhlenberg field for the past 13 years. I always enjoyed camp as a young player and dreamt that one day I could be one of the Muhlenberg softball players who was teaching the younger girls and helping them refine their skills. I accomplished that dream and made it a reality. Muhlenberg has been part of my life for many years, and I believe that Muhlenberg truly is where I was meant to be. <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s your most memorable Muhlenberg softball memory? </strong>My most memorable Muhlenberg softball memory has to be the conference championship weekend last year. It was not only one of the most memorable weekends because we won the conference championship, but the team also had so much fun being together and singing along to music (especially the Lion King) on the bus. There has never been a moment that I was happier to be part of such an amazing group of girls. I can honestly say that being part of this team the last four years has allowed me to be part of a special softball family here at Muhlenberg. All the girls I have met over the years have truly become my best friends and a very special part of my life. We cried, laughed, teased each other and confided in each other. Each of us is different in many ways, but we bring the best out of each other. We are truly a team that supports each other to the fullest. My most memorable Muhlenberg softball memory will be all the amazing people I have met by playing this sport throughout my years here. <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s the best off-the-field memory from your time here? </strong>My semester in Washington D.C. is my best off-the-field memory and an experience that I will never forget. I have fallen in love with the city, and my internship provided me the opportunity to not only live in our nation’s capital, but to learn about it firsthand. The Washington Semester enhanced my college education greatly. We went to our internships during the day and had class in the evenings. One day a week we had field trips and explored many of our national monuments. I learned to live in an entirely different environment, and I really enjoyed it. I had the chance to do many things in Washington that I would not have done if I did not participate in the semester. I not only made many new friends during the experience, but I was able to grow personally. I gained a new perspective of our nation’s capital, and I look forward to returning there one day in the future. It was a life-changing experience that I will never forget.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans? </strong>After I graduate from college I hope to find a position which will utilize the knowledge and skills I have gained during my four years at Muhlenberg. I think it is important that a person enjoys his or her career and feels fulfilled doing it, while still being open to any new avenues he or she can explore to further develop important skills. <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s Brittany Blohm like off the field? </strong>There is truly not a better friend you could ask for than Brittany. Off the field, she is someone whom her friends and teammates can confide in, no matter what the circumstance. She has a passion for life and knows how to have a great time. She is a great listener and is able to inspire each one of us to do our very best. Brittany is a true leader and has a very determined spirit. We enjoy getting together listening to music and just talking. She has a great personality and a beautiful, caring heart. I know that she will be successful in whichever path she takes in life after Muhlenberg.</p>

			<p><em>With the spring sports season just about wrapped up, we will be taking a closer look at Muhlenberg’s senior student-athletes.</em></p>
<p><em>We continue with baseball. Seniors Brian Beck, Nick Busillo and Mike Speroni were honored during a ceremony before the doubleheader against Washington. The next day, they helped the Mules come back to beat regionally ranked Johns Hopkins, thanks in part to Beck&#8217;s first career grand slam, in their final game.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/05/beckhs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1159" title="beckhs" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/05/beckhs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Brian Beck</strong><em></em></p>
<p><strong>How have you been able to become such a good defensive player? </strong>Defense has always been important to me, so I try my best to be the best defensive player that I can be through hard work and practice. In games, I try to get to every ball that I can in order to help the team, and I always try to be aware of what is going on around me. Also, though I know I will make mistakes, I try to remember what I did wrong and apply that knowledge to the next play in order to help the team win. <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>How have you been able to balance your time between baseball and school work to be named to the Centennial Conference Academic Honor Roll the last two years? </strong>Being a student-athlete means having a very rigorous and demanding schedule, especially during the season, so I try my best to manage my time as best as I can. To succeed both on and off the field takes a lot of effort and persistence, but I try my best to make sure that I am doing my best in the classroom and then try to be the best athlete that I can be on the field.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What was it like interning with the Secret Service during the Washington Semester? </strong>It was a great opportunity and experience that I was fortunate enough to achieve. I learned a lot from my time there, and I have fostered a great respect for the men and women who protect our country through that agency. <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans? </strong>I plan on pursuing a career in law enforcement. <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s Nick Busillo like off the field? </strong>Nick is not only a good teammate, but he is a great person. He always has a positive attitude both on and off the field, and seems to be having fun no matter what it is that he is doing. Although we don’t spend a lot of time together off the field, I have enjoyed my time with him as my teammate, and I wish him the best in the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/05/busillohs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1160" title="busillohs" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/05/busillohs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Nick Busillo</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where did the nickname Goose come from? </strong>It was from my first practice as a freshman. One of the seniors said I looked like someone who could cook French cuisine, and since it was during the time of Hurricane Gustav, they called me Gustav. Then it got shortened to Goose. Never in a million years did I think that the name would stick.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Do you have any hidden or unusual talents? </strong>I am a phenomenal dancer. I specialize in the classic moves. Joe Vila and Rob Shannon can confirm that.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>You’re one of the biggest guys on the team, yet you have seven steals. Where’d you get your lightning-fast wheels? </strong>Well, there are so many people to thank for that. But mainly it’s basically because no one pays attention to me, so I can get a good lead, get a good jump and then take the bag. I could probably have about 10 more, but I see the sadness in John Muha’s face every time I get a steal. Since he only has a few, I want to keep it close so he doesn’t get upset.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s your most memorable Muhlenberg baseball memory? </strong>Hitting the walkoff home run against Swarthmore last year. That is probably the most memorable in my entire baseball career.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans? </strong>Well, I will probably sail around the world on the boat that my dad, now being informed of it, will invest in. And then when I am done doing that, I’ll use that as my major selling point to get some cool job.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>What kind of person is Mike Speroni? </strong>Where do I even start with Speroni? Speroni is one of a kind. He stuck it out with Brian and I, and he gets my utmost respect for that. He’s a real tough kid; he is up there in appearances in a season and a career. That just shows that he can come in at any time and make an impact. He stepped up as a leader this year, and when we needed, he would ask for a lot of swag sauce. No one is really sure what that means, but that is OK because it makes him happy. I wish Mike nothing but the best after school, and I will miss having him as my teammate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/05/speronihs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1162" title="speronihs" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/05/speronihs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Mike Speroni</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do you have any superstitions you do before you go on the mound? </strong>Laugh at the guys in the bullpen. Seriously though, there have always been some characters down there, and it’s one of the things I do to try and stay relaxed before I step onto the mound. Obviously I need to be focused, but when I’m on the mound any pre-pitch thoughts are gone, and I’m in the moment. With pitching having the tendency to turn into a mental war between you and the batter, it’s important to stay calm. If you let your emotions get to you, they can take priority over maintaining the mechanical consistency needed for success. Baseball is 90 percent mental and the other half is physical, and anyone who’s been around the game knows that’s a fact.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s your most memorable Muhlenberg baseball memory? </strong>I’m going to have to pat myself on the back on this one. Probably my most memorable game was when I started against Haverford sophomore year and struck out the first six or seven guys I faced, minus the walk I sprinkled in the middle of it for a little flavor. My splitter was on that day, and everything just came together. Also just as memorable was working out of the fifth inning against Johns Hopkins my freshman year, then grabbing the win against them and shaking my dad’s hand after the game. That was pretty cool.</p>
<p><strong>What was it like studying abroad at La Trobe University in Australia? </strong>Expensive. The minimum wage was about $15 an hour, and their dollar was about even with ours. Everything cost about twice as much. Although that was initially tough to deal with, I learned a lot not only about budgeting, but life in general living in Melbourne for five months. I got to play ball over there and really enjoyed fixing the non-existent swing I had going into it. I made what I hope to be lifelong friends with two sweethearts from Nebraska who I spent a week in Fiji with for our Spring Break, one of the most memorable vacations I’ve ever been on. Fiji was cheap too, which was nice.</p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans? </strong>I’m currently working on an internship for the summer, and will be coming back in the fall because I ain’t no nerd. So to all the underclassmen reading this, don’t cry yet, I’ll be around to bother you some more in just a few months. Love you Mom.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What kind of teammate is Brian Beck? </strong>Brian is a great teammate and someone I’m proud to call a friend. He lets his actions do the talking, is extremely motivated, and always does the right thing. Also, he is probably the best foul ball recoverer and dugout janitor I have ever met. I don’t know what’s going to happen next year without him around, but you can probably bet on the umpire complaining he never has enough balls and our dugout will look like a landfill consisting of Slim Jim and Rice Krispies wrappers and empty Gatorade bottles. I’ve really enjoyed playing with him, Goose and our coaches, and I wish them all the best of luck next year.</p>

			<p><em>With the spring sports season just about wrapped up, we will be taking a closer look at Muhlenberg’s senior student-athletes.</em></p>
<p><em>We continue with women’s lacrosse. Seniors Kelsey Elmer, Maggie Hare, Sarah Hetrick, Angela Napoletano, Becky Ritter and Jessica Shegoski were honored during a ceremony before the season finale against Ursinus.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/05/elmerhs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1146" title="elmerhs" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/05/elmerhs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Kelsey Elmer</strong></p>
<p><strong>You rank in the top 20 in on the program’s career assists list; what’s your key to finding open teammates? </strong>My role is easy, I just need to make sure my feet are moving and that I get off a good pass. It’s my teammates that make the good cuts and get themselves open so I can get the ball in their sticks, especially this year. I feel that we’ve been able to really get a large majority of our goal off assists, which just adds to the greater feeling of team cohesion. It’s been really fun to be able to make those connections.</p>
<p><strong>What’s the most memorable moment from your lacrosse career? </strong>I think my most memorable moment from my lacrosse career would have to be this year against F&amp;M. We came out so unbelievably strong and everything was clicking so perfectly. We forced them to take a timeout, which was an awesome feeling knowing that they needed to regroup and figure out a new game plan to shut us down. This year, the team has had some of the best cohesion I’ve been a part of, and the first half of that game absolutely exemplified that. It makes it so much fun, too, when you’re just finding each other. It was a great feeling and showed that we can hang with the best.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your most memorable off-the-field moment or accomplishment from your time at Muhlenberg? </strong>My most memorable off-the-field moments were probably my time spent in Spain. Although it wasn’t specifically at Muhlenberg, school gave me the opportunity to spend a semester there. I had an incredible time with priceless experiences. And I have to say that any time off-the-field with everyone on the team is never dull and always full of ridiculousness and fun, which make us that much closer!</p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans? </strong>I am planning on earning some money this summer at home, and then I am looking to move to Denver toward the end of the summer or the beginning of fall. I’ve been looking into working in some different hospitals in Denver, either in clinical research or as a medical aid in a particular department. I’m also considering working at a spine and head trauma rehab center, which would allow me to really delve further into neuroscience. My final option is to just be a ski bum for a little while out there until I get my bearings. I wouldn’t mind that.</p>
<p><strong>What kind of person is Sarah Hetrick? </strong>Sarah is someone who has been working hard for the past four years and is always trying to make herself and her teammates better. She has a lot of versatility in that she can utilize her height in defense while bringing her speed and stick skills to the attack. It has been fun being able to play with her the past four years and watch her develop into a really strong player and good teammate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/05/harehs1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1148" title="harehs" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/05/harehs1.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Maggie Hare</strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s something about you people might be surprised to learn? </strong>I came to Muhlenberg without any concrete idea of what I wanted to major or minor in, and I actually hated my first communications course and first Spanish course that I took here. Despite that, I ended up majoring in media and communication and minoring in Spanish. <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What was it like visiting Spain? </strong>Visiting Spain this past summer was one of the most rewarding and exciting opportunities I’ve had as a student at Muhlenberg. I was equally excited and terrified going off and living in Spain with a group of people from different Lehigh Valley colleges that I’d never met before. I am so happy and lucky that I had the opportunity to go, because the experience really opened my eyes to how different life is in Spain compared to what I’m used to at Muhlenberg or back home in New Jersey. The cultural experience is what will stick with me the most. Once I got past the initial culture shock of life in Sevilla, I really enjoyed learning about the different traditions and customs of the people living there. I think one of the most important rewards I got from going to Spain was that I was really pushed far out of my comfort zone. It really gives you a new perspective on how you think about different cultures and how you see and understand yourself. <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s your most memorable off-the-field moment or accomplishment from your time at Muhlenberg? </strong>In terms of off-the-field lacrosse activities, one memorable moment that stuck with me was when we all went to do volunteer work in Allentown. One of the groups that we worked with was the Sixth Street Shelter. We went there and did some gardening work and anything else we could do to help. We also learned about the shelter and its efforts to help get families back on their feet and eventually able to provide for themselves. The experience was great because my teammates and I had fun working together and working with some of the individuals at the shelter. I think it is important for our team to give back to the community, and it was a very rewarding experience.</p>
<p><strong>What’s it been like getting to play four more years with your high school teammate Jessica Shegoski? </strong>I have actually been playing sports with Jess since we were in elementary school. That being said, playing eight years of lacrosse with her on top of that has been great! I’ve been really lucky to have such an amazing teammate and friend continue through high school and college with me. As an athlete and as an individual, Jess has known me and played with me longer than anyone else at Muhlenberg. Because of that, she has been a major source of encouragement for me on and off the field. I can’t imagine playing lacrosse without Jess. Jess has always been a good friend and has all of those qualities you’d want your teammate to have. She is relentless, encouraging, aggressive, a team player and has incredible sportsmanship (just to name a few). That being said, it’s hard to play any sport with her and not have those qualities rub off on you. Jess is a true role model, and I can’t imagine my lacrosse experience here at Muhlenberg without her.<strong></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/05/hetrickhs1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1154" title="hetrickhs" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/05/hetrickhs1.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Sarah Hetrick</strong></p>
<p><strong>As a midfielder, you’re asked to do a little bit of everything on the field; do you prefer playing offense or defense? </strong>It depends on the day! Coming from playing low attack in high school, I feared the idea of playing defense. But I have developed a love of it over the past few years. There’s nothing like causing a turnover and getting the ball back for your team. The only downside is all of the running!<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Do you have any hidden talents outside of lacrosse? </strong>I don’t know if I would call it a talent, let alone hidden (anyone who knows me knows I love food!), but I’d like to think I’m a pretty good cook.</p>
<p><strong>What’s the best part about playing lacrosse? </strong>The best part about playing lacrosse is that I belong to a team. I like to think of our team as my college family, and I can talk to them about anything, anytime. We are each other’s support system.</p>
<p><strong>What’s the most memorable moment from your lacrosse career? </strong>My most memorable moment was our win over Dickinson freshman year. Going into the game, our freshmen class was well aware of the past results with Dickinson, so when that great win came it was as if we had all won the lottery. We didn’t know what to do with ourselves!</p>
<p><strong>What’s your most memorable off-the-field moment or accomplishment from your time at Muhlenberg? </strong>My most memorable off-the-field accomplishment would have to be making the Dean’s List for the last three semesters &#8230; I finally learned time management!</p>
<p><strong>What made you decide to major in business administration? </strong>I have always dreamed of owning my own restaurant, so majoring in business administration seemed like the right path to get there. While I don’t plan on owning a restaurant any time soon, my major has given me plenty of other opportunities.</p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans? </strong>I am happy to say that I have a job lined up for after I graduate! I’ll be doing a combination of sales and operations for a food ingredient brokerage (yes, food!), and I’ll be traveling up and down the East Coast.</p>
<p><strong>What kind of teammate is Kelsey Elmer? </strong>Kelsey is a fun and easy-going person. As captain, she loves our team and does a great job keeping us focused. On the field, Kelsey is a key attacker with a rapid-fire shot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/05/napoletanohs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1150" title="napoletanohs" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/05/napoletanohs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Angela Napoletano</strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s your role as a team captain? </strong>This year it has been a lot about keeping the team positive — no matter whether we are losing by five or winning by two. The team’s mental attitude makes a big difference, so keeping everyone encouraged has been important.</p>
<p><strong>How big of an accomplishment has it been reaching the 100-point mark in your career? </strong>I was really happy to have been able to reach that mark throughout my four years here. I wasn’t able to finish the season last year, so to be able to finish my final season with 100 points is something I won’t ever forget. <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s the most memorable moment from your lacrosse career?  </strong>I said this in the beginning of the season, but as of now it still stands as my most memorable moment — beating McDaniel by one in overtime freshman year. I don’t think I could ever forget it. <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s your most memorable off-the-field moment or accomplishment from your time at Muhlenberg? </strong>There have been too many memorable off-the-field moments, but something I will never forget is going to Disney World for Spring Break with the team my sophomore year. Alex Franck, Alex Bellini, Kelsey Elmer and I were in a special pirate room far away from everyone else. But going into the parks and going on all of the rides with everyone was so much fun, and I wish we could do it again!</p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans? </strong>I will be going to graduate school in the fall to receive my master’s degree in childhood education. And from there I plan on becoming a teacher at the elementary level.</p>
<p><strong>What’s Becky Ritter like off the field?  </strong>Off the field, Becky is just as feisty as she is on it! She’s a great friend, and she will use her competitive drive to do well wherever life takes her after we graduate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/05/ritterhs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1151" title="ritterhs" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/05/ritterhs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Becky Ritter</strong></p>
<p><strong>How rewarding has it been becoming a full-time starter in your final season? </strong>It’s been extremely rewarding becoming a starter this year. I have worked really hard the past three seasons to improve my skills, and all of my hard work has gotten me to where I am today.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s your favorite part about playing lacrosse? </strong>There are two reasons why I love playing Muhlenberg lacrosse. One reason is that I am extremely competitive, and playing an intercollegiate sport has given me the opportunity to really be competitive. I think my favorite part about playing lacrosse here, though, is playing with everyone on this team. I get an opportunity to play with my best friends every day.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s the key to making a big defensive stop? </strong>The key to making a big defensive stop is having confidence and playing scrappy. You need to have confidence in yourself.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s the most memorable moment from your lacrosse career? </strong>My most memorable moment was beating McDaniel in overtime my sophomore year.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your most memorable off-the-field moment or accomplishment from your time at Muhlenberg? </strong>I have a lot of favorite moments here at Muhlenberg, but I think one of my favorite memories was going to Disney World with the team my sophomore year.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans? </strong>As of right now I don’t have any definite plans, but I am hoping to find something that I really love to do.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What kind of teammate is Angela Napoletano? </strong>Angela is a great teammate. She is so competitive and pushes everyone else to be competitive too. It’s clear that she loves the sport and the team. It’s been a privilege to play with her for an entire four years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/05/shegoskihs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1152" title="shegoskihs" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/05/shegoskihs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Jessica Shegoski</strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s your funniest Muhlenberg lacrosse memory? </strong>My funniest Muhlenberg memory is the opening ceremonies of the women’s lacrosse Olympics my sophomore and senior years. The entire team is split into different nations, and we all dress up in the style of our adopted homeland during the opening ceremonies. <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Do you have any pregame superstitions or traditions? </strong>I make it a point to get to the locker room super early, and I always have to make sure that my hair has some sort of braid in it. This year, the perfect game day hair style has been two French braids into a ponytail braid topped off with the perfect red polka dot ribbon tied in a bow. I also always have my headphones in my ears with my iPod on and music blaring. One of the last songs that I must listen to before getting on the field is “I Can’t Dance” by Genesis. <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s the most memorable moment from your lacrosse career? </strong>The most memorable moment was beating Dickinson my freshman year at Scotty Wood Stadium.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s your most memorable off-the-field moment or accomplishment from your time at Muhlenberg? </strong>My most memorable off-the-field accomplishment at Muhlenberg was being on the resident advisor staff for three years, and serving as the head resident liaison on campus this year.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans? </strong>My future plans are not concrete past July of this summer. In June I will be playing on the Israeli Women’s National Lacrosse Team in the European Championships. Then I will be traveling to Israel with the team to coach camps and clinics in order to spread the sport of lacrosse and hopefully help other girls fall in love with the sport I am passionate about. I am also continuously searching for employment for next year (I had a job interview on April 18, wish me luck).<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s your teammate since high school, Maggie Hare, like off the field? </strong>Maggie and I have known each other since elementary school. I cannot remember a sports season (either soccer or lacrosse) that I have not played with her. I have so many good memories with her both on and off the field, from long car rides to states like Maryland for soccer tournaments to rushing to Rita’s on the first day of spring after high school and college lacrosse practices. I am so glad I got to continue my college career with Maggie. <strong></strong></p>

			<p><em>With the spring sports season just about wrapped up, we will be taking a closer look at Muhlenberg’s senior student-athletes.</em></p>
<p><em>We continue with men’s lacrosse. Seniors Alex Ardolino, Corey Aferiat, Charlie Pianko, Nick Rispoli, Jonathan Fritog, Jay Salasko and Andrew Disdier were honored during a ceremony before the season finale against Haverford.</em></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/05/ardolinohs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1137" title="ardolinohs" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/05/ardolinohs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Alex Ardolino</strong><em></em></p>
<p><strong>How big of an accomplishment is it for you that you rank in the top 10 in school history in points and goals? </strong>It is a nice category to be a part of. There are many good players in that category, and some of them are my friends.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What are your strengths as a player? </strong>I feel that my speed and my ability to use my off hand are the strongest parts of my game.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your most memorable Muhlenberg lacrosse memory? </strong>Scoring the overtime goal to beat Haverford my sophomore year.</p>
<p><strong>What’s the best off-the-field memory from your time here? </strong>The trip to Vancouver this summer; we had a great time.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans? </strong>I will be working as a financial advisor in New York City.</p>
<p><strong>What’s Corey Aferiat like off the field? </strong>There is so much you can say about Corey. He is one of the funniest people I know. His one-liners and voice impressions are great. His claim to fame is his classic joke, “So a horse walks into a bar, and the bartender says why the long face?” Corey is a great guy to hang out with and one of the smartest people I know. We have had some fun times. He is always joking around and making people laugh, and I am sure he will continue to do that at Yale next year.<strong></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/05/aferiaths.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1138" title="aferiaths" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/05/aferiaths.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Corey Aferiat</strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s it like being one of the few guys on the team from south of the Mason-Dixon Line? </strong>It is nice to have a little geographic diversity on the team, and hopefully I add a little pseudo-southern character. However, it is really difficult being the only one on the team who can’t handle the cold weather practices. I have been outcasted for my wardrobe on numerous occasions, most notably for wearing my sweat suit to practice, even when it is in the 50s. I tell people it’s because I like to be comfortable, but they don’t seem to care. They just don’t understand the harsh transition from nice, warm Virginia weather to the freezing, arctic conditions we deal with here in the Lehigh Valley.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your most memorable Muhlenberg lacrosse memory? </strong>My most memorable Muhlenberg lacrosse memory was beating Gettysburg on our home field last year. To have everyone on the team show up like they did, leave it all out there and come out with a huge win was incredibly special.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What made you decide to major in political science and minor in public health? </strong>I had planned on majoring in political science when I got to college, but I didn’t know what area I was most interested in. It wasn’t until sophomore year when I figured out I would be best suited in American government and public policy. With regards to public health, I didn’t really have much of an idea about what public health was until I took a course in it as a sophomore. My mom had suggested I take the course, so I figured why not. I really enjoyed the class, and as they say, the rest is history.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans? </strong>Next year I will be studying health policy and administration at Yale University. After two years of graduate school, I hope to find a job within the realm of hospital administration.</p>
<p><strong>What kind of teammate is Alex Ardolino? </strong>Alex is an awesome guy to have out on the field and in the locker room. I admire him the most for his love of the game. It is clear that regardless of what is going on (winning streaks, losing streaks, bad practices, good practices) that he continues to love being a part of the game. When you watch him in practices and games, you can tell he experiences genuine satisfaction from just being around the sport. That kind of love and commitment for the game rubs off on his teammates, and it has certainly rubbed off on me. Despite the fact he has made me look inexcusably slow during sprints in practice for four years straight, I am definitely honored to have been his teammate. <strong></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/05/piankohs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1139" title="piankohs" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/05/piankohs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Charlie Pianko</strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s something most people don’t know about you that they might find interesting? </strong>An interesting fact that most people don’t know is that my dad and Doug Rheiner’s dad were fraternity brothers at Gettysburg.</p>
<p><strong>How have you improved as a player since coming to Muhlenberg? </strong>I would say I have improved every part of my game since coming to Muhlenberg. I think it is impossible not to when you go to practice every day with the amount of talent we have on this team. It forces you to get better.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s your most memorable Muhlenberg lacrosse memory? </strong>My most memorable memory has to be beating Gettysburg last year. To beat a team that Muhlenberg had never beaten before was something special.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s the best off-the-field memory from your time here? </strong>I think there is a high possibility I would get in serious trouble if I didn’t say when I met my girlfriend, so I’ll go with that.</p>
<p><strong>What’s it like playing against your brother who plays for Dickinson? </strong>It is a fun time for my entire family except for the fact that my parents do not know who to root for. I just wish we were able to beat them one of the three years we played against each other, because I am sure I will be hearing about it for the rest of my life. <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans? </strong>I plan on getting a job in accounting and seeing where it goes from there. I would also like to coach youth lacrosse or Pop Warner football in the future.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What kind of person is Nick Rispoli? </strong>Nick is a great person. I have lived with him the last two years, and although he can be quiet at times, he is always funny and entertaining to be around.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/05/rispolihs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1140" title="rispolihs" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/05/rispolihs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Nick Rispoli</strong></p>
<p><strong>What are the keys to being a good faceoff man? How have you been so successful? </strong>Step to the right!! Facing off is just like any other position; it’s all about practice and becoming comfortable with what you’re doing. I’ve been lucky enough to have some great coaches along the way that really knew what they were talking about that have helped out. It’s also nice when you have other great faceoff men around you to push you every day in practice. Having great wing play has also been a tremendous help over the years. To be completely honest, I don’t know how I’ve been so successful. I pretty much just go out there and don’t think. I hum a little tune to myself and just try to have fun.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s your most memorable Muhlenberg lacrosse memory? </strong>My favorite lacrosse memory has to be back in the high school state championship game my senior year, running down the field with Andrew Disdier on me and scoring a left-handed goal on him. But beating Gettysburg for the first time last season was my most memorable Muhlenberg lacrosse memory, by far. The atmosphere was outrageous. <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>We’ve heard you play a mean guitar; are you the next Eric Clapton? </strong>Oh, I can play a mean guitar; it’s really not fair. I’m more of a Bruce Springsteen fan myself; we’re actually in the middle of planning our summer tour dates now. <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What made you decide to major in business administration? </strong>Well, I meant to sign up for theater, but I guess I filled out the wrong form that day. But seriously, I’ve always been interested in business, particularly marketing and advertising. After taking some business courses freshman year, I knew that was the field I was most interested in, so I decided to pursue it. <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans? </strong>Aside from going on tour with my guitar with Bruce, I plan to move to California and hang out all day in the sun since I spent the past four years in the rainy Lehigh Valley. In all seriousness, I’m not exactly sure what I plan on doing and am still investigating and exploring my options. I’m all ears if anyone has any offers.</p>
<p><strong>What kind of teammate is Jonathan Fritog? </strong>Jonathan who? No, it’s been great being able to continue to play with Jonathan for another four years. I’ve known him for most of my life. He’s excellent at communication on and off the field and is willing to spend extra time with the players to help them improve and learn. He’s always trying to become better, but definitely knows how to have fun and can turn it on when he needs to. He also has a great lacrosse IQ (must be a Ridgewood thing).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/05/fritoghs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1135" title="fritoghs" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/05/fritoghs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Jonathan Fritog</strong></p>
<p><strong>You’ve taken quite a few drumming classes at Muhlenberg; are you a rock star in waiting? </strong>I don’t think I’m a rock star in waiting, but since Nick Rispoli takes guitar lessons, and we both took a magic class together, we decided that if we are unable to find jobs after college we will stay in Ridgewood (yes, with our parents) and become street performers. All we need is a singer like Jay “Mad Dog” Salasko, and we can be an official band.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your most memorable Muhlenberg lacrosse memory? </strong>My most memorable Muhlenberg lacrosse memory is definitely going on the Vancouver trip over this past summer. Even though the entire team wasn’t with us, it was still my most favorite vacation that I have ever been on because it was with all my friends. That trip really gave all the guys a chance to simply kick back, relax and enjoy being in a different country with each other. Oh yeah, and we played lacrosse there too. Also, scoring against McDaniel this year was pretty cool since they were my first collegiate points.</p>
<p><strong>What’s the best off-the-field memory from your time here? </strong>My best off-the-field memory from my time here is really all four years that I was able to spend here. From going from room to room in Walz hanging out with friends, then moving into Benfer with guys on the lacrosse team, then getting a house off campus and just being able to hang out with the people that have had such a great influence on my life in the past four years has really made this one of the greatest experiences of my life. I really owe it to all of the people that I have met and all of my friends that I have made here. I will truly miss this place and everyone that I have met. I will also miss beating Andrew Disdier in video games every day. I really have my parents to thank the most because they never stopped pushing me and believing in me to do my absolute best in whatever it was that I decided to do. And they never missed a single game in my time here at Muhlenberg, which means more to me then they will probably ever know. They truly are the best parents that any kid could ever ask for, and I am extremely grateful that they have acted as such a great support system to me throughout my life. Love you guys.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans? </strong>Besides becoming a street performer with Nick Rispoli, I want to become a high school teacher and lacrosse coach. I am going to take a year off after college and then hopefully go to grad school to get my master’s degree.</p>
<p><strong>What’s Charlie Pianko like off the field? </strong>Pianko is probably one of the nicest guys on the team. In my past four years here I cannot recall one time that I have ever heard him complain or not have a smile on his face. Charlie is just a happy-go-lucky guy who leads by example and is a hard worker.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/05/salaskohs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1136" title="salaskohs" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/05/salaskohs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Jay Salasko</strong></p>
<p><strong>What would you say is the strongest part of your game? </strong>The strongest part of my game would have to be my ability to communicate on the field.</p>
<p><strong>What made you decide to transfer to Muhlenberg after your freshman year? </strong>I came to Muhlenberg because it was a great opportunity to come to a great academic institution and join a great group of players who I had a chance to meet before I made my decision.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s your most memorable Muhlenberg lacrosse memory? </strong>I think our win against Gettysburg last year stands out the most. The emotion that we played with in that game fueled our victory, and it couldn’t have been a better feeling.</p>
<p><strong>What’s the best off-the-field memory from your time here? </strong>It is hard to choose the best off-the-field memory from my time here, but if I were to choose one I can guarantee that it would be with my teammates. Although we spend every day together on the field, our off the field time together is how we grew as a team. That said, it’s impossible to choose just one moment.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Some of your drawings were in a recent exhibition on campus; have you always been an artist? </strong>I definitely have not always been an artist and still don’t believe that I’m much of one. But the few drawing classes that I have taken here definitely taught me a few things that have helped me graduate from drawing stick figures.</p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans? </strong>After graduation I am hoping to find a graduate coaching position where I can further my schooling as well as get a jump start on a collegiate lacrosse coaching career.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What was it like getting to play three more years with your high school teammate Andrew Disdier? </strong>Playing with Andrew again was definitely a plus when I made my decision to come here. Andrew has been a great asset to the team in his four years here. He is a great guy to have in our locker room. He always helps to keep team morale up and keep those who are struggling motivated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/05/disdierhs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1141" title="disdierhs" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/05/disdierhs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Andrew Disdier</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do you have any hidden or unusual talents? </strong>I can tie my shoelaces without using my hands, and I’m fluent in five languages. However, those talents are completely dwarfed by the arsenal of tricks Connor Winter has.</p>
<p><strong>How frustrating has it been having to deal with so many injuries during your career? </strong>It is difficult to articulate the frustration. I will say that the recovery process has been much easier with the support from my family, teammates and coaches.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your most memorable Muhlenberg lacrosse memory? </strong>This past summer’s trip to British Columbia was unforgettable. <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s the best off-the-field memory from your time here? </strong>I’m a big basketball guy, so all the pickup games that we played in the fall were some great times. I know that Mike Carpetto and Jack Reilly will keep the tradition going next year. Beating Jon Fritog in “Around the World” in a single turn is something I won’t forget either.</p>
<p><strong>How was the experience interning with Merrill Lynch? </strong>I really perfected my envelope addressing and database updating skills at Merrill Lynch. In all seriousness, it was a great experience, because I was able to apply my academic ability to the professional workplace. The fundamental knowledge that I absorbed there really put me a step ahead for the following semester. I wish AJ “The Bond Vigilante” Diaz and Ian “The Big Short” de Ruiter the best of luck this coming summer at Merrill Lynch.</p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans? </strong>To start, I’m going to get my knee fixed. Professionally, I have accepted a bank examiner position with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, an entity of the Department of the Treasury.</p>
<p><strong>What was it like getting to play three more years with your high school teammate Jay Salasko? </strong>It has been a tremendous opportunity to play with Jay “Mad Dog” Salasko for an extra three years. He has always been a ferocious competitor, and he has a canny knowledge of the game. He is also one of the toughest players I know. If he did not have the back of a 55-year-old arthritic man and had not gotten sniped in the spleen by Corey’s rifle of a lefty bounce shot, I know his career would have looked a lot different.</p>

			<p><em>With the spring sports season just about wrapped up, we will be taking a closer look at Muhlenberg’s senior student-athletes.</em></p>
<p><em>We continue with men’s tennis, which beat Ursinus, 5-4, in its Senior Day match. Seniors Jordan Rutt, Andrew Brod and Robert Buesser were honored before the match.</em></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/05/rutths1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1129" title="rutths" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/05/rutths1.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Jordan Rutt</strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s been your key to balancing tennis and school work to be named to the Centennial Conference Academic Honor Roll each of the last two seasons? </strong>I’ve always been a horrible procrastinator, so playing tennis and having even less time for schoolwork makes me focus really hard during crunch time. Luckily it’s worked out pretty well!<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What was it like studying abroad in the Netherlands during the fall of your junior year? </strong>Studying abroad was the experience of a lifetime, which is why I took 10,000 photos! I had never even been on a plane before, so leaving America and flying across the Atlantic to a new continent was a huge adjustment for me. I still can’t believe I got to see 11 countries, and I certainly want to travel again when I’m older.</p>
<p><strong>Are your parents going to go through withdrawal next year not having any Muhlenberg sporting events to attend for the first time in eight years? </strong>Yes, absolutely. It will be the first time one of their kids isn’t playing a sport in 20 years, and they have never missed a single tennis match throughout both high school and college! Luckily my sister coaches high school field hockey, so they can go watch her games.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What are some of the funniest moments from your time with the team? </strong>Burrito seshes, swum seshes, singing on the bus rides, Maestro (and Eli), and watching coach lather sunscreen on an umpire.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Do you have a favorite pro player? </strong>Rafael Nadal because of his athleticism and fighting spirit, and Maria Sharapova for obvious reasons.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What made you decide to major in economics and political science? </strong>When I was a freshman I was really interested in politics, but I knew I wanted and needed something else too. I thought I might enjoy a career in business, but I kind of liked math as well, so I chose economics. I don’t really care that much for politics anymore, so I’m glad I’ll have that econ degree!<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans? </strong>I’ll be looking for a job in business or statistics, and maybe one day if I somehow get super rich I’ll attempt to become a politician (but I doubt it). I also definitely want to coach tennis in the near future.</p>
<p><strong>What’s Andrew Brod like off the court? </strong>Brod’s an all-around great guy. He’s goofy, happy, funny, a conscientious student, and not to mention a good friend. I’ll miss him a lot next year, along with the entire team.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/05/brodhs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1122" title="brodhs" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/05/brodhs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Andrew Brod</strong></p>
<p><strong>What was it like getting to intern at the Library of Congress and with former Senator Arlen Specter the past two summers? </strong>… Hoping to learn more from government service work in D.C., I was selected for the 2011 Summer Junior Fellowship program at the Library of Congress. Assigned to the law division, I was able to hone my research and analytical skills by examining U.S. Court of Appeals records and briefs. After reviewing them, I docketed the briefs in a proprietary computer system so that they can be located if a lawyer or law clerk requests them. The fellowship was a great opportunity to whet my appetite for the study of law, particularly antitrust and consumer protection law, interests that stemmed from constituent phone calls in Senator Specter’s office. During my research, I came across a brief in a case involving an NFL antitrust claim in Joe Kapp v. National Football League. That case inspired me to research antitrust and sports contracts, including a specific provision in standard NFL player contracts, and I presented the findings in an exhibition at the Library of Congress. I performed a detailed search as if I were preparing to represent Joe Kapp directly. Researching the law and applying it to the circumstances of a potential case was exhilarating to me.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have any interesting or unique pre-match traditions or superstitions? </strong>I like to keep the same overgrip on my racquet until it rips off completely.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have a favorite pro player? </strong>Gael Monfils<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What made you decide to major in psychology and minor in political science? </strong>I have always been interested in the intersection of psychology and law. After exploring the various disciplines, I found that studying psychology allows students to think critically, especially while attempting to take different perspectives and understand theoretical constructs that define everyday behavior. I feel as though it has prepared me well to handle the rigors of the law school curriculum. <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans? </strong>I will be attending law school in the fall.</p>
<p><strong>What kind of person is Robert Buesser? </strong>Rob is a perseverant and overall stand-up guy who I’ve seen grow as a tennis player over the years. His enthusiasm is uncanny; he has a desire to constantly improve. It’s quite an admirable trait.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/05/buesserhs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1124" title="buesserhs" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/05/buesserhs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Robert Buesser</strong></p>
<p><strong>What made you decide to join the team as a sophomore? </strong>Originally, playing tennis in college didn’t really cross my mind freshman year. But I was encouraged to try out after a couple kids on the team saw me playing. So I decided to try out as a sophomore, and it’s been fun ever since. I guess it’s pretty cool to be a college tennis walk-on.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s the most memorable moment from your tennis career? </strong>The times in practice were actually the most fun, but I think the most memorable moment came this year against Gettysburg when Corey and I came back from down 6-3, 40-love all the way back to win 8-6. <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s your most memorable off-the-court moment or accomplishment from your time at Muhlenberg? </strong>I have had the opportunity to be the Mule at the Homecoming football game twice. That was one of the most fun and memorable experiences I can remember.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Do you have a favorite pro player? </strong>Probably Roger Federer. He is the most respectable player in tennis because he almost never complains. And because of the hard work he puts into his game, he makes every shot look easy.</p>
<p><strong>What made you decide to major in psychology and minor in Spanish? </strong>Coming into college, I always subconsciously knew that I would major in psychology. I have always found psychology interesting and applicable to everyday life. In addition, the professors from the psych department left a great impression on me, and I knew that psychology was for me. As for Spanish, I have always been naturally good at speaking the language. Also, I have taken Spanish since seventh grade, so I decided I should continue to study the language. Speaking Spanish is very important because in 20 or 30 years the majority of the nation will be Hispanic.</p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans? </strong>My future plans include: Visiting every continent as well as the moon, curing cancer, saving a beautiful woman from a fire then marrying her, then eventually becoming the town hero of Little Rock, Arkansas.</p>
<p><strong>What kind of teammate is Jordan Rutt? </strong>Jordan is a great teammate and captain. He legitimately cares and notices how you are playing and, of course, gives great pre-match speeches.</p>
