								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week we had the Edible Book Festival, one of the tastiest days of the year. Students enter the contest and make a cake to represent a book. Throughout the day, everyone comes in and votes for their favorite cake. After, we all get to eat the cakes. I can honestly say that every single cake was delicious (Yes, I tried them all).</p>

<p>We also celebrated Earth day! Different vendors were sampling their products and students from the environmental club, EnAct, had a station where you could make your own smoothie by using the power from a bike. So of course I did it and took a video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWzo1xpmAp0">Here it is!</a></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week at Muhlenberg, I saw a total of 5 performances. The week kicked off with a bonfire where some Acapella groups performed. That weekend, Ben Folds came to campus! Three days later, a few of my friends went to New Jersey to see  Gavin Degraw Concert, and then that Saturday was Acapella Fest, where all of the Acapella groups perform in Empie Theater. Our school also invites groups from Lafayette, Syracuse, and other schools to come perform. Later that night, Aaron Carter came to campus to perform. That day also happened to be my birthday so when I walked into my room, it looked like this!</p>

<p>(Aaron Carter also hugged me when he found out it was my birthday… Not going to lie, my ten-year-old self was jumping for joy).</p>
