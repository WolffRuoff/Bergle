					<description><![CDATA[Great example and analysis here, Group 1!  You&#039;ve hit upon another interesting aspect of the &quot;then-MTV&quot; versus the &quot;now-MTV,&quot; which is that television has diminished as a source of social networking surrounding music.  In this sense, MTV is no longer a significant gatekeeper within the sound recording industry, since young consumers are turning to computers, mobile devices, and online music experiences like iTunes and Pandora to develop their sense of what kinds of music they&#039;re interested in.  TRL really represented the pinnacle of MTV&#039;s agenda-setting power in the industry, and I think you&#039;re absolutely right that they may be too late in trying to recapture some of that power to direct viewers&#039; attention toward specific artists and records.  Who ever thought that MTV would ever be passe for younger audiences?  Nice analysis here.]]></description>
