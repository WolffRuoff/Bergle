								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In an opinion piece published July 6, 2013, Dr. Sullivan, Associate Professor of Media and Communication, provides a critical view of digital information and privacy dangers in the wake of the NSA story revealed by whistle-blower Edward Snowden.  Dr. Sullivan points to four key trends that signal widespread and expanding corporate and government data surveillance.  In order for the public to be informed and able to participate in discussions with policymakers about privacy and public safety, Dr. Sullivan argues that &#8220;we need more transparency from both corporations and the government about the ways our data are gathered, stored and searched.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><b>Youth Media Reporter</b></em> is being relaunched and the journal invites articles and multi-media for a special issue designed to reintroduce this vital resource for stakeholders in the youth media field.</p>
<p>Between 2005 and 2011, <em><b>Youth Media Reporter</b> (YMR)</em> gathered together the voices and stories of many educators, practitioners, academics and young people to consider enduring principles and emerging practices in the youth media field.  During this time, <em>YMR</em> was established as <i>the </i>professional multi-media journal providing a forum for inquiry, exchange, learning, and collaboration among diverse stakeholders in the youth media field, unique in its embrace of both research and practice-based articles. In late 2012, <em>YMR</em> transferred hands from the Academy for Educational Development to the Department of Media and Communication at Muhlenberg College.</p>
<p><em>YMR’s</em> focus and purpose remain unchanged:  to build the field by documenting, from multiple perspectives, insights and leading lessons related to engaging young people in video, film, television, radio, music, web, art, and print media making. The field of youth media has grown and evolved considerably since the last issue of <em>YMR</em> was published in March 2011.  We invite submissions that focus on a variety of areas, but we especially welcome articles that help document and reflect on how the field of youth media has changed in the two years since <em>YMR</em> was published.  What new opportunities, practices, and pedagogical approaches have opened up in the field?  What other professional spaces have emerged to support youth media as a community of practice?  How are social and political forces shaping what is possible—and what is not possible—within youth media?  What new directions are opening up in youth media and are there new tensions opened up as the field expands?</p>
<p><em>YMR</em> is a peer-review journal, bringing together both academic research papers and op-ed journalistic styles articles, alongside multi-media digital presentations.  The journal encourages papers from new practitioners and emerging scholars, as well as established, pioneering voices in the field of youth media, and we value equally contributions from youth media makers. <strong>Deadline for submissions is July 15, 2013</strong>.</p>
<p>Email inquiries to <a href="mailto:ltaub@muhlenberg.edu">ltaub@muhlenberg.edu</a> and see submission guidelines here:  <a href="http://www.youthmediareporter.org/contribute.html">http://www.youthmediareporter.org/contribute.html</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><img class="size-full wp-image-1014 aligncenter" style="border-style: initial;border-color: initial;cursor: default;border-width: 0px" alt="ymrsitelogo" src="http://mediacom.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/06/ymrsitelogo.png" width="300" height="100" /></p>
<p>Media and Communication at Muhlenberg College is honored to serve as the new home for the <em>Youth Media Reporter</em>, the only professional journal dedicated to the youth media field.</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>YMR </em>creates exciting new opportunities for students to connect their academic studies to hands-on activities that support the production of the journal,&#8221; says Lora Taub-Pervizpour, the journal&#8217;s new editor.  &#8220;<em>YMR</em> creates yet another space where Media and Communication students connect theory and practice to help shape conversations about media in the lives of young people and their communities.&#8221;  In courses like <em>Youth Media </em>and <em>Children and Communication</em>, students will have opportunities to engage in the journal&#8217;s production process&#8211;from reviewing, editing, publishing and social media outreach.</p>
<p>Ingrid Dahl, director of Next Gen programs at <a href="http://www.bavc.org" target="_blank">Bay Area Video Coalition</a>, agrees.  &#8220;That <em>YMR</em> will be led by a team of students at Muhlenberg College ensures that the journal’s evolution will be in the best of hands – inquisitive minds, investigative hopes, determined best practices, and the finger on the pulse of change. Having YMR in the hands of the next generation—I couldn’t ask for a better home for the field’s increasing visibility and credibility.”  Dahl edited the journal from 2005-2011.</p>
<p>On May 7, the National Alliance for Media Arts and Culture and the National Youth Media Network hosted an online Connector Session about the journal&#8217;s relaunch and focus.  A video archive and transcript of that session are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-W4qsaUNw" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg was selected to host the journal because of its award-winning youth media program <a href="http://hype.blogs.muhlenberg.edu" target="_blank">HYPE</a> and longstanding media and social justice mission. “HYPE is about valuing youth voices,” states Jenna Azar, HYPE director. “YMR provides a space for documenting critical insights from the many programs across diverse communities that share this commitment to valuing and supporting young people as media makers, storytellers, and advocates.”</p>
