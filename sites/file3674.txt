					<description><![CDATA[Really nice overview of this new &quot;format war&quot;, Group 1!  As you rightly point out, this is somewhat reminiscent of the Beta-VHS format war of the 1980&#039;s, though a little bit different simply because MP3 players can still play either 16 or 32-bit music.  So, the issue here seems to be tussles over the &lt;b&gt;pricing&lt;/b&gt; of music online, something that the music industry and Apple have fought bitterly over in the past.  Since Apple is so dominant in the online music industry as a distributor and exhibitor, the record labels are often at its mercy when it comes to pricing of songs.  So, this technological shift from 16 to 32 bits may simply be a way to nudge Apple higher on online pricing for songs via iTunes.  Good job here.  Very nice links to other information on the web as well!]]></description>
