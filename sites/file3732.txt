<p>RBR-TVBR. (2011, April, 25). In-car streaming perceptions, misperceptions examined. <em>Radio Broadcasting Report.</em> Retrieved from http://www.rbr.com/radio/in-car-streaming-numbers-perceptions-misperceptions-examined.html</p>
<p>With the increasing technological growth and use of internet-streaming radio stations such as Pandora, iHeartRadio, and other cloud-based sites, the public still recognizes that the production and distribution of “over-the-air” terrestrial radio remains one of the most used media outlets while driving.  In a recent Radio Broadcasting Report article, it was made known through a survey of 18-44 year olds, that having streaming-internet radio in cars is not a threat at all to the AM/FM radio stations, or even Sirius/XM.  &#8220;The good news is most users of in-car streaming radio continue to use over-the-air radio extensively&#8221; (rbr.com).</p>
<p><span id="more-1171"></span></p>
<p>Using the Automobile Industry as one of their linking pins, internet streaming radio is trying hard to stream themselves over other industries.  Maybe for the satisfaction of becoming a vertically integrated industry, the internet might be a little over zealous when trying to take over multiple media outlets.  The majority of these blogs have focused on the fact that internet radio sites like Pandora, iHeartRadio and many others are becoming major exhibitors for not only just music, but the recording industry itself.  The popularity of streaming internet stations in the car mostly comes from the linking pin of the cellphone industry.  People are able to buy cables that will simply connect their smartphone to the radio.  They won&#8217;t need to buy a full dashboard radio system that will connect their internet radio to the car.  &#8220;It is thought that most of that listening still occurs at home or at work on computers connected to the internet because of the perceived difficulties related to connecting to the internet in the car&#8221; (rbr.com).  When surveys are taken to see how many people are listening to internet radio, we cannot assume that it is just for the car, all these other media outlets still need to be taken into account.</p>
<p>Within the article there are perceptions noted that describe how certain industry and power roles are concerned with these internet radio stations taking over.  The internet might be able to vertically integrate themselves as producers, distributors, and exhibitors due to the fact that our information age has taken rise <em>because</em> of the internet.  To understand the perceptions (or misperceptions) of the internet radio streaming in cars, it would be better to read the <a href="http://www.rbr.com/radio/in-car-streaming-numbers-perceptions-misperceptions-examined.html">article</a> in full.  But in short the four perceptions are: that streaming is not yet happening in the car, once streaming becomes widely available in cars terrestrial radio will be dead, people won&#8217;t pay for an in-dash solution, consumers will want more pre-sets with in-dash systems.</p>
<p>Although this might be a huge exhibitor power role in the future, in-dash internet radio systems need a lot of adjustment to satisfy the consumer.  Although the client power role of the advertisers might see this as a great deal of business for them, only having one automobile producer and distributor for an internet radio system (Ford and its SYNC system) limits the possibility of substantial profit and growth.</p>

<p>Cecillia Kang. (8, April 2011). Web firms face increased federal scrutiny over Internet privacy. <em>The Washington Post. </em>Retrieved from <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/web-firms-face-increased-federal-scrutiny-over-internet-privacy/2011/04/06/AFvREp1C_story.html">http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/web-firms-face-increased-federal-scrutiny-over-internet-privacy/2011/04/06/AFvREp1C_story.html</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Internet radio, such as Pandora, used with linking pin power roles such as the smartphone mobile industry, was recently subpoenaed by the government on the terms of illegal distribution of personal information.  When a user logs into an internet related radio site on their smartphone, their private information is given to that certain company to be distributed to their client power role, the advertisers.  Using Pandora, (although other internet related radio websites have been included in this court hearing) a federal grand jury served this subpoena in order to justify that these services disclose users personal information such as telephone number, gender, personal interests, and other information, illegally.</p>
<p><span id="more-1100"></span></p>
<p>Not only are the internet radio sites being reevaluated for their privacy terms, but most of the internet is also, involving the internet power role.  In a Washington post article, the associated press tells that the Federal Trades Commission is now wanting to post a &#8220;Do Not Track&#8221; option for internet users.  The federal grand jury investigation is prominent on declining Pandora&#8217;s ability to access users information from their smartphone accounts.  Having advertisers as client power roles, Pandora released the private information to third parties for these advertisers to see the demographics and the amount of users on their site.  &#8220;Pandora said it shared information with third parties to help it track how users interact with the service and to deliver targeted advertising. But the company, based in Oakland, Calif., said it was “not a specific target” of the grand jury investigation.&#8221; (NYtimes.com)</p>
<p>Because internet radio is an enormous distributor and exhibitor power role, it will be extremely hard to shut it down; along with all the other cloud-based radio stations.  But having the &#8220;Do Not Track&#8221; option on their website will definitely create a boundary when it comes to gathering information for targeting their audiences for their paying advertisers.  &#8220;In its filing, Pandora said that a government Do Not Track mandate &#8216;could significantly hinder our ability to collect and use data relating to listeners&#8217; &#8220;(NYtimes.com).</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Trust, G. (5 April 2011). ‘Glee’ cast, Matthew Morrison score first radio hit, thanks to original songs. <em>Billboard</em>. Retrieved from <a href="http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/industry/tv-film/glee-cast-matthew-morrison-score-first-1005113042.story">http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/industry/tv-film/glee-cast-matthew-morrison-score-first-1005113042.story</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://blogs.villagevoice.com/dailymusto/Glee-Cast-glee-9252428-600-429.jpg" alt="" width="241" height="173" />What’s the difference between <em>American Idol</em> and <em>Glee</em>? After all, both are television shows that promote the music industry. One difference is that, until now, Fox&#8217;s <em>Glee</em> wasn’t in the business of producing new artists. While some of the <em>Glee</em> cast’s covers have taken the Internet by storm and run quickly up the Billboard Top 100—<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds38BOOtGIQ"><em>Don’t Stop Believin’</em> may be the most famous</a>—they’re still just different versions of already-famous songs. All of that changed, however, with the recent release of the first song produced specifically for the show, called “Loser Like Me,” which has a critical advantage over all the covers: It’s getting radio airplay, premiering at #37 on the Nielson Adult Top 40.</p>
<p><span id="more-1082"></span></p>
<p>This, of course, is huge. The radio and sound recording industries have been connected at the hip since their mutual beginnings during the turn of last century. Radio is a critical facilitator for the music industry, introducing targeted demographics of consumers to new music; radio, in turn, relies on other media to supply fresh material for its listeners. Producers, for their part, are all too willing to do that. The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/26/business/26music.html?_r=1">desperation with which producers jockey for radio airtime</a> speaks to radio’s enduring importance to the music industry in the age of 200-channel television and iTunes. Increasingly these producers include the owners and creators of television shows like <em>Glee</em> who are hoping to run their content through another window.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The producers of <em>Glee</em>, like the labels that sign the <em>American Idol</em> winners, can opt out of this desperation because their artists are practically guaranteed airplay. <em>Glee</em>’s enormous popularity on television means that the cast’s music, which premieres on the show, is practically “pre-sold.” Radio program directors take huge risks when they add new music to their playlists, and they’re always looking for ways to reduce that risk. What better way to do that than to play music that’s already popular on other media, like television?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indeed, the <em>Glee</em> cast’s transition from mere facilitators pimping other artists’ music every week to producers releasing new material has been nearly seamless, with program directors scrambling to play the new music. The music fits perfectly with what the modern pop radio industry wants: It’s upbeat, unchallenging, and <a href="http://www.billboard.com/news/glee-returns-with-huge-ratings-win-1004115894.story#/news/glee-returns-with-huge-ratings-win-1004115894.story">already popular with that crucial 18-34-year old audience</a> (<em>Glee</em> consistently ranks #1 among that audience, teenagers in general, and teenage girls in particular, the equivalent of a royal flush for Fox). Interviews with program directors across the country confirm that sentiment, with one program director in Indiana lauding the new song’s ability to “resonate with kids and parents” and admitting that the new song’s origins in <em>Glee</em> give it a “leg up” in gaining airplay on her station.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <em>Glee</em> cast will soon promote their new music by going out on tour, with 22 scheduled appearances set to begin on June 22nd in Minneapolis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The success of <em>Glee</em>’s new music speaks to the power of a popular program to travel across media. With a variety of television shows either playing others’ music or facilitating the production of new music, the synergy between the two industries has never been stronger. Media industries like radio, sound recording, and television help each other reduce risk by mutually sharing popular content, which translates into stronger revenues for the large conglomerates that own most media companies today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whether that translates into more choice for consumers, however, is questionable. Public advocates continue to argue that the sharing of content across media, especially unchallenging content like the <em>Glee</em> music that appeals to the lowest common denominator, drowns out artists and voices with alternative views that may challenge the media conglomerates. Until popular music stops making money, however, the conglomerates are likely to continue to encourage this type of cross-promotion of content into the future.</p>

</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are we beginning to count on the Internet for everything?  Not only are we beginning to rely on our music playlists created on online streaming cloud-based sites, but the founders of Skype are betting on our usual creation of playlists created in iTunes, are moving to &#8216;<a href="http://www.indystar.com/article/20110403/BUSINESS06/304030004/1281/BUSINESS06">celestial jukeboxes</a>&#8216; listened to through the Internet.  These internet radio stations, and cloud-based playlist options, are becoming new distributors for artists&#8217; music.  We aren&#8217;t completely forgetting about terrestrial radio in cars, and on systems in the house, but when people are choosing to listen to these internet streams they immediately think, well&#8230; can I play this in my car? Around the house?  In the bathroom?  And with the emergence of new technologies that support the access of these internet &#8220;user-created&#8221; stations and playlists, industries of many different types want to get their feet in the door.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span id="more-1043"></span></p>
<p>Linking with the music industry, radio is now becoming an on-demand service.  Listeners are able to pick their music, and if they have the technologies acquired for listening to their music, they will be more than willing to do so.  The automobile industry, smartphone industry, and the television industry are all becoming exhibitors and distributors for this idea of the &#8221; &#8216;celestial jukebox&#8217; of the Internet, allowing listeners to play virtually any song, any time, anywhere, through a variety of Internet-linked devices.&#8221;  Not only do we see the Internet becoming a huge producer and distributor for the internet radio, its facilitation is allowing for extreme variety when it comes to listening to music.</p>
<p>This is extremely threatening to FM/AM radio.  Those who will have access to these streaming sites will begin to acknowledge the fact that they are willing to pay a subscription fee/month to be able to listen to any music of their choice.  Instead of turning on the radio, hearing the same 20 songs played by the hour, and listening to boring, ever-lasting advertisements, they can subscribe to the internet radio sites, create their own playlists, and enjoy the music that they want to hear.  Some of these cloud-based sites aren&#8217;t subscription based yet, so they still need the support of the advertising power role, but in time they will build up to being subscription based.</p>
<p>&#8220;<a href="http://mog.com/">Mog</a> and <a href="http://www.rdio.com/">Rdio</a> offer subscribers unlimited access for a set monthly fee &#8212; $9.99 for both companies. For that amount, subscribers can select any song from a catalog of 8 million to 10 million tunes and listen through any device connected to the Internet.&#8221;  These are other Internet radio sites like Pandora and Slacker radio, and are giving people the chance of unlimited access for a small fee.  These sites can be accessed in the car, on a smartphone, and even on the television. &#8221; For times they lack an Internet connection, subscribers can store songs to a phone or laptop, music they can use as long as they subscribe.&#8221;  This is an extremely important feature because I&#8217;m sure the client-based roles were concerned with this aspect.  Not only could this bump out iTunes as a music distributor and exhibitor, but it can also knock out mp3&#8217;s and CD&#8217;s.  All in all, the internet is beginning to control not only social life, but how we now listen to music, and understand radio.  We don&#8217;t envision radio as talkshows, or advertisements anymore, because we have the ability to create the music played for us on &#8220;our&#8221; own, creator made radio stations.</p>

CEO Mel Karmazin predicts that improving auto sales, declining capital expenditure, and the up-coming release of Sirius XM 2.0 to improve functionality will also add to the company&#8217;s success on into the future. Competition for Sirius XM, however, may be growing stronger.</p>
<p>Pandora Radio will be available as part of the new Chevy MyLink in-vehicle entertainment system, allowing listeners to synch their smartphones containing their existing Pandora accounts to the system.</p>
<p><span id="more-860"></span></p>
<p>In addition, GM will be incorporating voice and song recognition software so that the driver can for the first time control their listening through a device other than their smartphone device. According to Pandora SVP Jessica Steel, over half of radio listening takes place in the car. Now with Pandora as accessible in the car as Sirius XM or terrestrial radio, not to mention portable and in-dash music players, they stand to benefit from this large in-vehicle listening market and compete with Sirius XM directly.</p>
<p>Pandora recently detailed plans to go public, which Sirius XM said was ultimately non-threatening; however, if Pandora, which as of 2009 had 40 million users, can gather significant financial investors, then it is possible that they could integrate into the same market areas and capture a significant portion of Sirius XM&#8217;s target audience. Pandora and Sirius XM are different in that listeners must pay for a subscription to Sirius XM, which is a satellite radio. Pandora is free, on the other hand, but its profits depend on advertisements directed towards highly specified and coveted audiences. Pandora is based on the Internet. Since Pandora is free, is targets a younger audience, from around 17-15 who d not necessarily have the finances to support serious XM subscriptions; this could have long term effects if Pandora becomes successful in gaining brand loyalty. Additionally, younger audiences prove to be more tech-savvy and opt to use their smartphone devices for more and more services.</p>
<p>However, they both ultimately offer a more personalized listening experience in increasingly overlapping environments, which gives Pandora something of a competitive advantage in this regard. Pandora allows one to skip songs and build personalized music stations, while Sirius XM offers only present channels which are differentiated by genre and station-selected playlists. Listeners may come to decide that they would rather be free to customize their own listening on Pandora at the expense of listening to advertisements. This of course would negatively affect the number of subscriptions to Sirius XM which, again, depends on subscriptions for their revenue.</p>

<div><span id="more-793"></span></div>
<div>These ideals create reason for Pandora to being to seek revenue for their site.   It is a unique site, therefore a &#8220;Wall Street&#8221; investment with an IPO (Initial Public Offering) to give Pandora capital to expand their intentions of keeping this site active for unique creativity of their users and potential users.  “Pandora is the leader in internet radio in the United States, offering a personalized experience for each of our listeners. We have pioneered a new form of radio – one that uses intrinsic qualities of music to initially create stations and then adapts playlists in real-time based on the individual feedback of each listener.&#8221;  This was quoted in the article by the Pandora company to give reasons as to why this hundred million dollar investment will be worth while and show great prospect in the future. Again, Pandora hopes to provide itself with more capital for expansion without incurring any debt. The risk is that the stock may lose value should investors lose faith in the company&#8217;s ability to make money, however because the company sees that Wall Street is being &#8220;receptive&#8221; to IPO&#8217;s in 2011, they have faith in this investment for the betterment of their company.</div>
