								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Internet has arguably become the most powerful thing known to mankind. It is one of the most popular and most widely used things by humans.  It has the ability to connect people worldwide literally making the world a smaller place. Online, you have the choice to be well known or anonymous, funny or serious, even evil or good hearted. The power of the Internet is unlimited and continues to grow every day. One of the scariest aspects of the Internet however is the fact that everybody has the ability to be anonymous. Anonymity is a very complicated thing, especially when it is applied on the Internet. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The video I watched was a TED Talk titled, </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Christopher &#8220;moot&#8221; Poole&#8221;: The case for anonymity online. Christopher Poole is famous for founding the anonymous imageboard website 4chan in which users can post anonymously on any topic they wish. It is famous for many memes including lolcats and rickroll. It is also notoriously known for many of the bad things the Internet has to offer. Interestingly enough, Poole did not really talk about the bad things that 4chan causes like the threats and the degradation of certain people. The closest thing he comes to talking about the bad side of 4chan are the rules, Poole says</span><span style="font-weight: 400">, “So does a site like this have rules? We do; they&#8217;re the codified rules that I&#8217;ve come up with, which are more-or-less ignored by the community.” This seems like an excuse that Poole is making. He is trying to explain that the fact that 4chan has a very negative connotation attached to it is not his fault. He even says, “The content is not dinner table conversation in the least.” This just shows how most of the content of 4chan is not of quality. I believe this is due to the fact that it is an anonymous site. I bet if 4chan required a username or picture that would eliminate the anonymity aspect of 4chan, the site would be very different from what it is like now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anonymity is also a very dangerous thing on the Internet because many people think that since they are anonymous they can do whatever they want. This is not the case, Poole says, </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And last, I&#8217;m going to show you the example, the story of Dusty the cat. Dusty is the name that we&#8217;ve given to this cat. This young man posted a video of him abusing his cat on YouTube. And, you know, this didn&#8217;t sit well with people, and so there was this outpouring of support for people to do something about this. So what they did is they &#8212; I mean, they put CSI to shame here &#8212; the Internet detectives came out.They matched, they found his MySpace. They took the YouTube video and they mashed everything in the video. Within 24 hours, they had his name, and within 48 hours, he was arrested.”</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This just shows how no matter what you do online and no matter how anonymous it is you might end up getting caught for something bad that you did. You always have to be aware of the consequences of every action, even online.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Overall, the Internet is anonymous whether we like it or not. I believe that you can have a great time on the Internet as long as you are safe. Since the Internet is anonymous you can have no idea who is who online therefore it is important to act just the way you would in real life. Sites like 4chan encourage bad behavior because of the anonymity aspect if it. One of the most important aspects of the internet that more people should follow is to be more aware of how they are behaving online.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“You have to see it to believe it.” Those were the words of a young student referring to the new learning methods used in his classroom. (Google for Education, 2015) In the 21<sup>st</sup> century, it has become incredibly unrealistic when teaching students about the variety of places around the world. However, this is coming to an end. What if you could see anywhere in the world all through a single lens? With Google Cardboard and the company’s new Expeditions program, this has been made possible. Today’s society is in the midst of excessive technological growth and change. Things are being done now that were never imaginable back in the day. Google’s Expeditions Pioneer Program brings class lessons to life. It offers an enriched experience that’s more interactive by letting students enter a world beyond their imagination by putting the globe right before their eyes. Learning has become that much easier.</p>
<p>Many believe it’s hard to learn the true meaning of a place without visiting it in person. Luckily for them, this is all about to change. Just a few years ago, Google unveiled a virtual reality headset known as Google Cardboard. And now it’s taking that one step further. Google’s Expeditions program lets you go places that were never thought conceivable. The program has already reached classrooms in the United States, United Kingdom, Brazil and Australia with many to come. But what’s so great about it? All for an exceptionally low cost, anyone can travel the world through a single lens. It’s quite remarkable.</p>
<p>With Cardboard, Google reinvented virtual reality. While textbooks are a great source for information, they’re sometimes hard to get and not everyone can afford them. Taking the subject Geography for example, while textbooks can show you a bevy of images taken from various places and wonders of the world, they don’t supply a full experience. This has left many wanting something more. According to (Google for Education, 2015), one of Expedition’s major strengths consists of just about anyone being able see the world through a lens in three-hundred and sixty degrees. Students can now walk through the jungle, visit the Great Wall of China, climb through the mountains, and even dive into the deep blue ocean. Many agree that this is the future of education and are shaken by how far technology has come. This relates to our class discussions at the beginning of the semester regarding recent technological growth. The experience is like no other. It’s believed by many that student takeaways will be much larger than one’s gains from just reading. Teachers believe it’s essential that students are able to see what they’re actually learning about in order to learn it properly.</p>
<p>An Expedition can best be described as a guided tour in which schools and buses aren’t capable of. While the list of places is quite vast already, it’s always growing to capture the world. Using Cardboard virtual reality headsets, students can physically walk around on the moon or fly over the Rocky Mountains just by tilting their head and pointing towards a certain direction. During the session, teachers can point out highlights while discussing their class notes at the same time. Many have come to the conclusion that this immerse experience makes learning more fun, interactive and thrilling, which can be seen in the video (Google for Education, 2015) during the student’s reactions. The headset is composed of nearly all cardboard keeping the price down, and thus allowing students all around the world to gain access to it.</p>
<p>Can you imagine sitting in class and visiting some the world’s greatest monuments without ever leaving the room? Now students can live this dream. The journey of Expeditions has just begun. Students worldwide can now see what it’s like in another continent or biome without the need to travel there. With the development of this product along with many others, it has become clear that technology has grown to a point where many can’t even believe the outcomes. There’s so much out there to see in such a small life span, and this device helps us conquer the world at our own convenience. Relating back to the common theme, it’s these experiences that will allow students to thrive in their academics, further enhance their education and develop a better understanding of the world around them. Who knows where it will take us next.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Look around you, look to your left, to your right, behind you and now back at yourself. Everyone you saw including yourself is a liar, we are all liars. While sitting at the dining hall, on the second floor enjoying my lunch one afternoon I noticed from a birds eye view all the different conversations people were having. I wasn’t eavesdropping, just to clarify but I did hear from up above, “No, that dress doesn’t make you look fat!” I wasn’t going to judge that girl on her response but it led me to wonder why people disguise the truth and how often they do it. I could not get my mind off this subject, thinking to myself how often I might be lied to on any given day and how I might be able to detect it. I went online, quickly flipping through article after article until I found a Ted talk entitled, “How to Spot a Liar” by Pamela Meyer. I was enlightened on what she had to say.</p>
<p>She answered all of the questions that flooded my head earlier that day, providing in depth explanations to the complexities of deception and how deception and lies can impact not only our social lives but our lives on a much bigger scale as well. There are a few elemental facts about lying, one being that it is a collegial action. Not every lie is catastrophic, but there are certainly many willing participants who take part in deception for the sake of their social dignity, i.e.: the case with the dress. These willing participants are the ones who kick start deception to a whole new level. Ones who constantly lie and manipulate may think that their wrong doing will impact only those directly involved but as we have seen in recent history that is not the case. Back in 2010 for example, Bernie Madoff deceived the entire nation single handedly into just under trillions of dollars in debt. It is the unwilling participants who are affected most and lies like these so evidently betray our country by jeopardizing security and undermining our government.</p>
<p>We are all opposed to lying, but frequently do it in so many different ways. What’s astonishing is that you could potentially be lied to up to 200 times in any given day (Meyer). And even worse, strangers lie about 3 times within the first 10 minutes of meeting each other (Meyer). And on top of that, by the time kids reach college they lie to their mom on average 1 out of every 5 interactions !(Meyer). Now that makes me feel like a terrible son. Lies and deception occur everywhere, we encounter unavoidable spam in our emails, fake digital friends on Facebook, identity thieves and Ponzi schemes and it is all because our world is changing faster than we could have ever anticipated. Meyer said “it’s transparent with blogs and social networks broadcasting the buzz of a whole new generation of people that have made a choice to live their lives in public” (Meyer).  We complain about privacy rights and manipulative media but we are the ones deceiving one another. The advanced new world texting and tweeting blind us to the basic subtleties of human decency.</p>
<p>Take another look around the room, the people and yourself deserve an honorable society where truth can be heightened and promoted and one where deception is publicized.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Andy Yen discusses the role of privacy in today’s technologically driven society and how it has become almost nonexistent. His Ted Talk entitled, <em>Think your email’s private? Think again.</em> focuses on the matter of email and how many people are blind to the fact that all emails are visible to the public. Everything on the internet creates data, and what’s alarming is the notion that, “our data now lasts forever, so your data can and will outlive you.” (Yen, 2014) Data not only reveals personal information about us, but also indicates who we interact with, where we are, and what we think about. This summation of data open to the public officially deteriorates the concept of privacy, for the new generation of digital natives are taught to share everything about themselves online.</p>
<p>With regard to email, Yen makes an interesting comparison to postcards. He discusses how emails are not private and are the equivalent of sending a postcard, since, “everybody that sees it from the time it leaves your computer to when it gets to the recipient can actually read the entire contents.” (Yen, 2014) This observation is alarming because if the entire internet can read your emails, the comparison to text messaging must be analogous. Invasion of privacy has become such an integral part of this digital generation that it raises the fear of becoming a new social norm. The uses of this bank of information and data is endless. The government is the obvious thought that comes to mind when posing the question of, “Who’s listening or watching on the other end?” Next comes big businesses and all of their marketing tactics to sell personalized products to us, however, besides the government and big business, who else has an interest in our lives? It’s an important question to ask ourselves when choosing what we post online.</p>
<p>Yen proposes a way to secure our information to prevent the public from gaining access to our emails. The solution that already exists is called encryption, however common people do not have the skillset to execute that process. What Andy and his team of scientists developed is an app entitled ProtonMail. Created in the cafeteria of the European Organization for Nuclear Research, CERN, ProtonMail enables the average person to send automatically encrypted emails without the, “server being able to read what’s going on”, or the user seeing the encryption. To the users, they are emailing their friends and family as normal, however the emails are not open to the public to read or save as data. It is quite genius how Andy and his team made the extremely complicated process of encryption into an easy app that allows individuals to ensure their privacy and live without the eyes of the public watching their every move.</p>
<p>ProtonMail is beneficial because privacy has become a foreign concept in this digital age. This app makes privacy an option for the average person who otherwise would not know or understand how to encrypt his/her emails. Andy’s activism towards privacy reform is inspiring and significant to the movement because he emphasizes how if, “we want to have privacy online, what we have to do is we’ve got to go out and get it ourselves.” (Yen, 2014) It’s an absurd concept, the act of fighting for our privacy. Privacy should be a basic human right, for I thought it was very clearly protected in the Fourth Amendment. However, through manipulation and corruption within the marketing industry and federal government, people have found loopholes to gain access to our entire lives which have now essentially been posted online. The lack of privacy in this world is a, “global issue that impacts all of us&#8230;We have to build an Internet where privacy is no longer just an option, but is also the default.” (Yen, 2014) Through people like Andy, the fight for privacy is gaining extensive support. It has surpassed just the development of new technological innovations and has become a fierce confrontation with the oppression of human rights.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Social media is a platform which allows the teens of today’s world to communicate with other people from all around the world and from all walks of life. In theory, social media is a positive mechanism that brings all people closer together. However, in reality, the complete opposite is true. As explained in the YouTube video “How social media is affecting teens,” the youth of today are being harmed by too much social media interaction. The ways in which they are being affected does not refer to one’s impaired eye sight from staring at a screen for too long or obesity from reduced activity. Rather, this destruction is attributed to the desire to be famous (The National, 2014).</p>
<p>Researcher Yalda Uhls conducted a few experiments on teenagers in Los Angeles and elementary school students in Canada (The National, 2014). The basis of the experiment was to get the kids to write down a personalized list of the top 16 lifetime goals and aspirations that they valued the most in order of importance (The National, 2014). When this experiment was conducted in the past the 15th goal, which can be assumed to be almost the least important, was typically fame. Uhls’ results were the complete opposite during the most recent version of the similar experiment; the majority of teens that were involved in this study had fame as their number one want in life (The National, 2014). According to Uhls, this sudden desire to be famous is closely linked to the increased use of social media today. This escalation in time spent being engaged with some nature of technology is not allowing teens to have time for reflection whether it be of oneself or another person. In turn, this causes these technology-driven teens to have less empathy for others which subsequently leads to a generation full of people who do not care about the well-being of others (The National, 2014). This statistic is just another aspect in which social media is damaging society.</p>
<p>Obviously teens are not spending 100% of their time on social media sites. Whenever their nose is not in the phone however, they are sometimes mesmerized by a program that is on television. These programs go hand in hand with social media and can be used to explain why today’s teens have such an overambitious want to be famous (The National, 2014). Some of the most popular television shows from the past decade deal with people being liked and becoming famous. For example, <em>Hannah Montana</em> was about a girl who was an average teenager by day and an iconic pop star by night and <em>American Idol</em> was about average people auditioning in front of judges and competing against other contestants to be recognized as a wonderful singer (The National, 2014). Although both of these shows no longer exist, they are certainly what today’s teens grew up watching which makes them relevant to the issue at hand.</p>
<p>In the long run, it can be argued that parents are the culprits to be blamed for this unrealistic infatuation that teens possess (Marshall, 2009). More and more often today you see children who can’t walk or talk yet but are toying with an iPad and navigating through the device better than most adults would be able to. Parents who shove technology in the faces of children just so they will stop bothering them are the ones who are kick starting the obsession with social media and therefore, the desire to be famous. If children were taught that being famous is not everything from the beginning then society would not be faced with a bunch of young teens who only care about how many likes their selfie got on Instagram.</p>

<p>Recently, New York Times Journalist, Stuart Goldenberg, wrote an article called “IPhone 6s’s Hands-Free Siri Is an Omen of the Future”, which essentially conveys the idea that our society is taking a new, technological direction towards voice recognition and artificial intelligence. He describes the two as “A necessary part of Modern Computing”. A well defended statement but in a way he is almost contradicting his own argument because if he is saying that these two applications are “necessary” to Modern computing throughout our society then why is he minimizing its significance by describing it as a “part”? Later in the article he describes this revolutionary new idea, known as “Ambient Computing”, which Stuart describes as “a future in which robotic assistants are always on hand to answer questions, take notes, take orders or otherwise function as auxiliary brains to whom you might offload many of your chores”. Oddly enough he describes this as a “futuristic” idea but can’t one argue that our Phones, Computers, TVs, Videogames and all of our other twenty first century devices could hold the title of “Robotic Assistants” due to the fact that they do withstand most of our Dailey loads, making our lives not only easier but more simplistic as well. So rather Ambient Computing be considered a “futuristic” goal, I think its fair to say that its something that we have easily touched heavily upon but that there is also so much still out there that we haven’t created that can still revolutionize our day to day lives. Goldenberg eventually takes a social turn on the power of artificial intelligence, along with voice recognition, when he writes “It will be slightly creepy and completely helpful”. Conveying the idea that, at first, we may be very hesitant towards this very odd but incredible technology but that instead of seeing either one or the other, we will see that even those who find it to be “creepy” or “odd” will submit to its foreignness due to the beneficial value it has to offer. Stuart then shows us how these creatures of this never ending technology realm are adapting to this new technology when he points out a very compatible new app called “Sound Hound” which is basically a voice powered search engine that has the ability and potential to revolutionize the way we search by giving us more in depth results of the precise thing we were looking for. Illustrating the idea that the many faces of our technological world are completely on board with this very clear-cut direction. Towards the end of the article, Stuart starts to describe his take on the steps we will soon see most individuals go through when cooping with this new machinery when he utters “The more assistants there are, and the more you use them, the more natural they feel — and that means the more you’ll use them, feeding the cycle”. I noticed how he used the word “more” consecutively throughout that single sentence, demonstrating the idea that there is always going to be more, and that there will never come a time when people will stop thinking of new ideas. This repetition of such a simplistic world also shows that even though all of these new creations are beyond beneficial to our society, we don’t really have a chose as to if we want them to play a role in our lives. Each new deice always seems to find away into our pockets, signifying the idea that even though we “use” the technology, that we are actually, in a sense, just mere slaves that feed on the aid of these machines. At the end of the day I think its important to realize that technology will always be “there” but the term, “there” is broad, it could mean in our homes, in a store, or even in our pockets but just because its “there” doesn’t mean we have to use it, or buy it, or surround our lives around it. We have to realize that, just like everything else in life, technology is what we make of it and we, as individuals, have the power to choose the technology we find necessary to better ourselves and the technology that we consider to be wasteful.</p>
