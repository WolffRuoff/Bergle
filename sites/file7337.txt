					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Not only are our identities impacted between online and offline, but perceptions are as well and how those perceptions are built. There is a perception that all information is available all the time, through Google. While about 40% of Internet traffic is through Google on a daily basis, Google can only provide access to a very small portion of all information. It can index a small portion of the surface web, but not the deep web which is at least 500 times the surface web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fame is certainly one way to bring more results in your general direction, but so does being active in the online world and using search engine optimization. And it is always evolving, so what is returned will change over time, too.&lt;/p&gt;
