								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recently, New York Times Journalist, Stuart Goldenberg, wrote an article called “IPhone 6s’s Hands-Free Siri Is an Omen of the Future”, which essentially conveys the idea that our society is taking a new, technological direction towards voice recognition and artificial intelligence. He describes the two as “A necessary part of Modern Computing”. A well defended statement but in a way he is almost contradicting his own argument because if he is saying that these two applications are “necessary” to Modern computing throughout our society then why is he minimizing its significance by describing it as a “part”? Later in the article he describes this revolutionary new idea, known as “Ambient Computing”, which Stuart describes as “a future in which robotic assistants are always on hand to answer questions, take notes, take orders or otherwise function as auxiliary brains to whom you might offload many of your chores”. Oddly enough he describes this as a “futuristic” idea but can’t one argue that our Phones, Computers, TVs, Videogames and all of our other twenty first century devices could hold the title of “Robotic Assistants” due to the fact that they do withstand most of our Dailey loads, making our lives not only easier but more simplistic as well. So rather Ambient Computing be considered a “futuristic” goal, I think its fair to say that its something that we have easily touched heavily upon but that there is also so much still out there that we haven’t created that can still revolutionize our day to day lives. Goldenberg eventually takes a social turn on the power of artificial intelligence, along with voice recognition, when he writes “It will be slightly creepy and completely helpful”. Conveying the idea that, at first, we may be very hesitant towards this very odd but incredible technology but that instead of seeing either one or the other, we will see that even those who find it to be “creepy” or “odd” will submit to its foreignness due to the beneficial value it has to offer. Stuart then shows us how these creatures of this never ending technology realm are adapting to this new technology when he points out a very compatible new app called “Sound Hound” which is basically a voice powered search engine that has the ability and potential to revolutionize the way we search by giving us more in depth results of the precise thing we were looking for. Illustrating the idea that the many faces of our technological world are completely on board with this very clear-cut direction. Towards the end of the article, Stuart starts to describe his take on the steps we will soon see most individuals go through when cooping with this new machinery when he utters “The more assistants there are, and the more you use them, the more natural they feel — and that means the more you’ll use them, feeding the cycle”. I noticed how he used the word “more” consecutively throughout that single sentence, demonstrating the idea that there is always going to be more, and that there will never come a time when people will stop thinking of new ideas. This repetition of such a simplistic world also shows that even though all of these new creations are beyond beneficial to our society, we don’t really have a chose as to if we want them to play a role in our lives. Each new deice always seems to find away into our pockets, signifying the idea that even though we “use” the technology, that we are actually, in a sense, just mere slaves that feed on the aid of these machines. At the end of the day I think its important to realize that technology will always be “there” but the term, “there” is broad, it could mean in our homes, in a store, or even in our pockets but just because its “there” doesn’t mean we have to use it, or buy it, or surround our lives around it. We have to realize that, just like everything else in life, technology is what we make of it and we, as individuals, have the power to choose the technology we find necessary to better ourselves and the technology that we consider to be wasteful.</p>
