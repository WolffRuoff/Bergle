								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the article <em>The digital identity divide: how technology knowledge impacts college students</em> by Joanna Goode, the divides between technology usage of certain ethnic, gender, and socioeconomic groups. One thing that stood out was the fact that, regardless of race, lower income households had less technology exposure than households with a higher income. Students from those families do not have the “boost” in the job market and college search. With the common application online and many more colleges using it, those with the greater technological exposure have a greater chance to get the jobs and colleges they want. Even in school, the deficiency of technology usage is not harmful. The article talks about a girl named Lara. It reads: her “low technology proficiency haunts her academic career.” Most teachers assume that students automatically know how to use technology which may exclude some students. Although these students are not well versed in technology, they actively embrace it. Going back to Lara, the article reads: “this low level of technology knowledge did not translate into negative attitudes toward technology, however. She loves computers…” which means that these students may have an ability to accept new technology while the older generations are not as inclined to do so. This could link to the ability of younger people to pick up new things quickly while the old dogs aren’t able to learn those new tricks the puppies can. Fortunately, schools are getting better with teaching students to use technology more efficiently, albeit at a slower pace than technology is progressing but it’s progress none the less.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In chapter 4, <em>Personal Identity in the Age of the App</em>  by Gardner, H. &amp; Davis, K, depicts the difference between an online and an offline identity. A common saying is do not believe everything you see on the internet and I see this to be especially true when it comes to someones online identity. Social media these days is a place where many kids, especially those in high school go to share what might be happening in their lives. Whether it is sharing the great gifts they recently received, the awesome places they might be and in general how great things may be. At least that is what they want you to think. Most kids do not want to be an outsider, they do not want to be that one kid who is having a bad time or is depressed or just is not feeling how everyone else is. Everyone wants it to seem like they are doing just as well as everyone else and this is described by Molly in chapter 4, &#8220;On Facebook, people are more concerned with making it look like they&#8217;re living rather than actually living&#8221; (Gardner &amp; Davis 63).  You never really know what someone might be going through just by their social media accounts. People will hide behind the scene and make it seem like everything is okay. One of my friends was depressed for the longest time before anyone knew anything about it. Going by just her social media she would be the happiest and most fortunate girl you&#8217;ll know. However news came out that she was going through some problems and that is why the social media identity is not always accurate towards someones real identity. Be careful what you believe online, you might think someones life is perfect, however turns out you never really knew anything about them.</p>
