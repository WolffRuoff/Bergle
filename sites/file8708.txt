								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this article, Mike Hanski uncovers the ways in which reading can positively impact not only a person’s writing skills, but also a person’s quality of life. Hanski continuously argues that writing is not teachable and “can’t be got by simple learning of grammar rules, punctuation marks, and different writing techniques.” (Hanski, 2014, p.1). It seems that the only way to truly grasp the art of writing is to read other authors’ works and gain insight on the different techniques, wide array of vocabulary, and overall structure used.</p>
<p>In my personal experience, reading benefitted my writing skills greatly in taking the SATs last year. I dreaded opening the first page of my booklet to the 25-minute essay being that I was never prepared for what kind of prompt would be thrown at me. Most times, I would not be able to formulate my ideas concisely or even have any ideas at all for that matter. After receiving a 7 out of 12 my first time around, I took the initiative and decided it would be a good idea to read graded example essays that other students had written. I read essays that scored a 2 all the way to essays that scored a perfect 12. In doing this, I learned how to properly analyze all different types of prompts. I was able to recognize repeating patterns in both the low-scoring essays and high-scoring essays and eventually pinpoint my own mistakes. On the next SAT I took, I put to use all of the knowledge I gained from reading the sample essays and scored a 10 out of 12. Doing well on my essay helped me get a high overall SAT score, which helped me get into a good college, which will hopefully give me plenty of job opportunities in the future.</p>
<p>Not only does reading affect a person’s caliber of writing, but it “helps kids define who they are, as it connects them to the rest of the whole world” (Hanski, 2014, p.2). By widening a student’s vocabulary and deepening their knowledge, it is inevitable that they will become more well-versed and understanding of the world. Hanski explains that without these vital tools, social exclusion is a very plausible possibility. “Pupils who are functionally illiterate at 16 consider school a simple waste of time and become most likely unemployed by the age of 30, as they do not believe anything they do can have a real effect on their lives” (Hanski, 2014, p.2).</p>
<p>It is truly mind-blowing how the simple act of reading can influence a person’s life so positively or so negatively.</p>
