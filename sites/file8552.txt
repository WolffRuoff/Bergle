								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In today’s society, I think that it is safe to say that we can’t live without the Internet. Through using the Internet, we have access right at our fingertips to news, social media, and numerous search engines such as Google and Yahoo. Since we can so easily access the Internet, sources like the newspaper are becoming less important. Anything we come across in the newspaper, chances are we will be able to find on the Internet faster.</p>
<p>An incredible social media tool that the Internet provides us access to is Facebook. It has been in existence for just over ten years now, and is the most popular social media website, attracting more than 1.49 billion users (Reddy, 2015). Facebook also allows us to view news, more specifically though, news that typically targets human interest. The Internet is “increasingly impacting all spheres of life across the world” (Reddy, 2015). It is coming to a point where people are becoming dependent on Facebook, and some people want to get connected to the Internet solely so that they can become active on Facebook. Before the Internet, not only did we not have access to Facebook, but we also relied heavily on resources such as newspapers, magazines, and radio to find out information. Google and Facebook are continually becoming more popularized in today’s society since they contain such a significant amount of information and serve as such a beneficial tool in our daily lives. It is said that “Facebook and Google will continue to dominate the online space” (Reddy, 2015). Both tools wouldn’t have been made possible without the Internet. The Internet now allows us to search for potential jobs, conduct research, connect with people nationwide, and so much more. It is because of reasons like these that Facebook and Google will continue to dominate our online world and keep us coming back. Having access to so many incredible tools myself in today’s society, it is hard to imagine what life would be like without the Internet. In conclusion, the ways in which we benefit from Internet access in today’s society are endless. This generation has brought us more technological resources than ever before.</p>
