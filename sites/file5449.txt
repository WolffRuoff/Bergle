								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi all! So we’ve started doing performances, and it’s been really exciting! Two performances down, eight to go! And I’m starting to get packed for my jetsetting off to India (right after our last performance.) This whole week is a little crazy.</p>
<p>But I want to go back to those first two performances. One of the things we mention in the play is slut shaming, and there’s been a lot of confusion over just what, exactly, slut shaming is. I figured this blog was the perfect place to put a slightly more comprehensive definition.</p>
<p>Slut shaming is a method by which society discourages people from having sex. Slut shaming is generally a tactic aimed at women, as women are typically held to a more rigid standard of sexual conduct, but a person of any gender can be slut shamed. It is when other community members make comments about the person’s behavior or presentation that admonish them for being more sexual than society deems acceptable.</p>
<p>A person does not actually have to be engaging in any amount of sexual encounters to be called a slut. It is not about behavior, it is about perceived behavior.</p>
<p>The reason slut shaming is bad is that it shapes our perception of rape. If a person experiences slut shaming, it can damage their self perception in the future. But it also devalues their worth as a person. If other people view them as a slut, they are viewing that person as “easy.” That person then becomes the target for rape or sexual harassment because they lack the agency to say no. If they are a slut they are expected to comply with an sexual advance at any time, regardless of if that advance is wanted and reciprocated, or not. Rape allegations from women who are deemed sluts by broader society are taken less seriously, although the event may be just as traumatic for the survivor.</p>
<p>Slut shaming goes hand-in-hand with victim blaming as part of the rape culture that we live in. But you’ll hear more about victim blaming in the show! And maybe I’ll come back and write more about that soon.</p>
<p>Hopefully this clears things up for those of you who were unsure what slut shaming was. The reference may make more sense now. Enjoy the show!</p>
