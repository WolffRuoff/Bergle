								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whenever I go through my home videos, I always stumble upon videos of me doing what I loved as a kid: watching TV. Barnie, The Wiggles, Blue&#8217;s Clues; you name it, I probably have watched it. Given that I was an extremely shy child, I always preferred staying at home rather than playing at the playground with my classmates. I feel that this deep-seated my love for technology.</p>
<p>This love for technology grew exponentially when I was introduced to video games. When I was about six years old, my parents bought me a Gameboy. Shortly, this hand-held gaming device never left my hands. I would use it to play games such as Pokemon, and I would also watch countless episodes of The Fairly Odd Parents on it when when traveling with no TV. I thought this gadget was the greatest invention ever. Little did I know how much I would love the Gamecube, which I got when I was seven. I was mind-blown by this gadget because it could connect to my TV and had more intricate buttons to press compared to the Gameboy. By then, I was <strong>hooked.</strong> I had a daily routine of getting up 2-3 hours before I had to go to school so I could play my favorite games, such as Monkeyball. Not only that, but as soon as I would get home from school, I would run straight to my Gamecube to play some more. It didn&#8217;t take long for my parents to realize that I had an unhealthy obsession. I was distraught when they had to restrain me from playing for so many hours a day, but now I am thankful that they did so because I became more focused on schoolwork and playing with my friends.</p>
<p>My technology obsession took a hiatus for a while until I got a Wii when I was ten. This Christmas gift was the greatest thing ever because not only was it a gadget that required motion, but it had adapters for Gamecube users so that I could still play my Gamecube games. It was like I had the best of both worlds! My favorite game was Guitar Hero III. That year I had attempted to learn how to play the guitar, but I gave up rather quickly because it was too challenging. Playing Guitar Hero brought out my inner guitar player wannabe. Guitar Hero taught me what determination feels like; I was not going to stop until I reached the expert level. Once I reached my goal, I felt so accomplished that I couldn&#8217;t help but gloat to my friends.</p>
<p>My constant texting habit that I still have today dates back to my first phone that I got for my 11th birthday. I thought I was hooked when it came to my Gameboy, but I was 10 times more hooked to my phone. It never left my sight (unless if my parents took it away). Nowadays I haven&#8217;t changed much, but I am more aware about how much of a distraction phones are so I try my best to focus on more important things. I feel that my obsession with technology for almost my whole life exposes my shyness because it has always been an outlet of entertainment when I feel bored or lonely, rather than conversing with people face-to-face. Sometimes, I wish I was like Brian O&#8217;Neill in &#8220;Teens Who Say No To Social Media&#8221; by Christine Rosen because he &#8220;doesn&#8217;t need social media to stay in touch&#8221; (Rosen 2016). Without social media, I would feel out of the loop because almost all of my friends post what is going on in their lives on a daily basis. Sometimes I miss the days before I started using social media because I didn&#8217;t feel stressed over how many likes I got on a picture that I posted. I do recognize that this is a silly thing to stress about because &#8216;likes&#8217; don&#8217;t matter, but I have yet to completely stop caring and worrying about it. Though I do feel satisfied when I do get a lot of likes, it unfortunately shows how much I care about what others think about me, and I should only focus on how I think about myself.</p>
