<p>(2011, 12 April) Sirius And XM Allowed To Merge In Canada. <em>FMQB</em>. Retrieved from <a href="http://www.fmqb.com/article.asp?id=2159191">http://www.fmqb.com/article.asp?id=2159191</a></p>
<p>The CRTC (Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission allowing Canadian Satellite Radio Inc. to merge with Sirius Canada Inc. and renewed each of their one-year licenses. CSR is the XM affiliate in Canada. The CRTC claimed that the merger would &#8220;offer clear benefits to the Canadian broadcasting system and to Canadian consumers.&#8221;</p>
<p>The new company will be named Canadian Satellite Radio Holdings, , and its largest shareholders will be John Bitove, the owner of CSRI Inc., US-based Sirius XM, CBC/Radio Canada, and Slaight Communications.</p>
<p><span id="more-1116"></span>The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission is one of Canada&#8217;s authority power roles. Without its approval, the Canadian counterparts to XM and Sirius would not be able to merge, despite facing financial difficulties. The merge could apparently save the companies a combined $20 million over 18 months and allow them to combine their strengths to attract more subscribers.</p>
<p>&#8220;This decision will lead to the creation of a stronger combined  organization, better equipped to innovate and compete in the broader  audio entertainment marketplace,&#8221; said Mark Redmond, President &amp; CEO  of both Sirius Canada and the merged entity.  &#8220;We are pleased that the  CRTC recognized the clear benefits derived from this merger.  This is an  exciting time for Sirius|XM Canada, and we look forward to continuing  to offer a world-class entertainment experience for our current and  future subscribers.&#8221;</p>
<p>The merger is also good news for the satellite radio companies because they will no longer have to compete with each other for contracts with linking-pin companies&#8211;namely automotive companies. This merger may sound good to potential or current subscribers because it seems like the combined company will be able to offer more over a broader range of content. It may be true, however there is also the possibility of viewing this as a continuing trend of consolidation in the radio industry.</p>
<p>Just as the provisions in the Telecommunications Act of 1996 abolished limits on how many radio stations one company may own was followed by terrestrial radio consolidation, the two major satellite radio providers are now owned by only one company. On the other hand, this may give satellite radio a fighting chance at remaining an up-and-coming radio platform that has not yet realized its full, impressive potential.</p>
<p>Canada’s antitrust watchdog is the Competition Bureau. The CB approved the merger  in February, but certain  closing conditions remain. The merger is scheduled to close by June 2011.</p>
