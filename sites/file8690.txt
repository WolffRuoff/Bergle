								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Before apps and the internet, people needed to wait to get their news. Newspapers were delivered early in the morning packed front to back with the latest news from the day before. Aside from the nightly news, newspapers were the main way to know what was going on in the world. Mornings were spent reading newspaper articles at the breakfast table while sipping coffee and eating breakfast. Fast forward to the 21st century where people rely on apps such as Twitter to get breaking information at the palm of their hands instead of waiting for the paper boy to deliver the newspaper every morning. With an increasing reliability on apps that provide breaking news whenever and wherever, the use of newspapers is at an all time low and continuing to decline. According to research done by The Future Exploration Network, “Newspapers in their current form will become insignificant in the United States by 2017,” (Gunelius, 2014). The Future Exploration Network’s research has the United States as the first country to forgo newspapers. Soon after their 2017 prediction for the United States, nations such as Iceland, Canada, Norway, England, and Finland will all follow the United States in eliminating newspapers in current form. Gunelius states that the end is definitely approaching for newspapers, “Unless newspapers can find a way to transform their business models, Future Exploration Network’s extinction predictions for newspapers as we know them could come to fruition even sooner. Research keeps showing again and again that the end is near. How soon the end will arrive has yet to be determined,”(Gunelius,2014). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With the extinction of newspapers in their current paper form on the way, no one is able to deny that the world continues to become more and more digital by the day. As I read Gunelius’ article, I thought of how books have gone digital with the Kindle and the ability to download books straight to your smartphone. Schools are starting to use Ipads and and other tablets for reading books instead of having physical copies for students. I believe that books in their current form will not be available in a matter of years just as The Future Exploration Network predicted for newspapers. Huge bookstore chains such as Barnes and Noble have had a huge increase in store closures as a result of the increase in digital purchases of books.  With the digital world becoming increasingly widespread every single day, physical copies of newspapers, books, magazines and other paper produced materials have their days limited.</span></p>
