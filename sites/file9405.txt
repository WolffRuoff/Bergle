		<p><em>With the semester winding down and finals just around the corner, we start our final round of senior profiles from the fall sports. Today, field hockey, and next week, football.</em></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/deangelisbhs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-328" title="Brittany DeAngelis" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/10/deangelisbhs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Brittany DeAngelis</strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s the most common misconception about twins? </strong>Although many people assume that being twins must mean that you are exactly the same, I think that Courtney and I really challenge the stereotype. Besides the obvious height difference (we are four inches apart, although Courtney will never concede to that), Courtney and I have very distinct personalities and different interests. Courtney and I are much more different than we are similar, and I think people quickly learn how very different we are after getting to know us. <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>You’re the school’s all-time leader in defensive saves.</strong> <strong>What’s been the key to making all of your big stops?</strong> While I can’t give away all of my secrets, I think that the biggest part of making the stops is having this overwhelming desire to not want to see that ball get past the goal line. I hate the sound of the ball hitting the back of the cage, so I really try to do anything that I can to make sure that doesn’t happen.</p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans? </strong>I hope to become involved in either marketing or event planning in the future. I spent my summer interning at Rider University and was responsible for coordinating and managing events, and I really enjoyed my time there. I look forward to balancing my career with having a family, and hopefully I will still have time for some field hockey in my old age.</p>
<p><strong>What’s it like playing on defense with Shelby Smith?</strong> Shelby has a great stick and consistently makes big plays for us in the backfield. Shelby and I have grown very comfortable with one another on the field, and I never question her ability to shut down the offense and come up with the ball. Overall, I think that Shelby is an excellent field hockey player, and I couldn’t think of a better partner to have with me on defense.</p>

<p><strong>How would you describe yourself as a player? </strong>I think the best word to describe me is “scrappy.” I hustle to the ball whether it’s a game or practice. I’m especially aggressive in the circle, and my approach when I play is that a goal is a goal, it doesn’t matter if it’s pretty, ugly or just plain lucky.</p>
<p><strong>What off-the-field accomplishment are you most proud of? </strong>I was recently published in a literary arts journal. I submitted a piece I wrote my sophomore year in a nonfiction writing class, and the editor worked with me to make it less of an academic piece and more of a memoir. I thought it was incredibly kind of her to take the time to work with me and make it stronger, and it was encouraging to hear that others liked my work. Knowing that people outside of Muhlenberg will read my story is exciting.</p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans? </strong>I’m currently applying to graduate schools in hopes of obtaining a doctorate degree in psychology. I’d like to do clinical work, but haven’t decided if I want to work with children or adults. It’s cliché to say that I love helping people, and that’s why I want to enter the field, but I’ve always been a good listener and can’t see myself doing anything else. Ideally, I’d like to open up my own private practice one day. My major and minor have further inspired me to write a self-help book too. <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s Jillian Katz like off the field? </strong>Jill is one of my roommates, so there’s a lot that I could say here, but I’ll be kind… All kidding aside, she’s one of my best friends here at Muhlenberg, and I’m so happy I was able to meet her through field hockey. Jill is funny and energetic, and despite her small size, she has a big personality. Jill is a wonderful friend who is always there to listen to me, and she supports and encourages me both on and off the field. <strong></strong></p>

<p><strong>What’s it mean to you to be a captain? </strong>Having the title of team captain is a privilege, and I am honored to provide leadership for the team. To me, being a captain means that you lead by example both on and off the field. It means that you motivate and try to encourage positive thinking. I try my best to be there for all of my teammates, especially when the going gets tough.</p>
<p><strong>What off-the-field accomplishment are you most proud of? </strong>An off-the-field accomplishment that I am most proud of is taking the leap to study abroad in Florence. Four months is a long time to be in a foreign country, but I survived! I am proud of the way I went so far out of my comfort zone and learned how to truly do things on my own thousands of miles away from home. <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans? </strong>My immediate plan is to find a job in the marketing field that will challenge me and help me gain experience to further my career. My dream is to eventually start up a business with my younger sister, Heather, that somehow involves us going back and forth to Italy 🙂<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What kind of teammate is Courtney DeAngelis? </strong>Courtney is the definition of a good teammate. She has worked unbelievably hard all four years to be the best player she can be. She has so much heart and desire, and wants to see everyone do their best. Whenever I have been down, she has always been there to pick me back up. She may be a little girl, but when she is on the field, she is a force to be reckoned with. When all is said and done, I am incredibly lucky to have had Courtney on my team, and even more lucky to have her as my best friend.</p>

<p><strong>What was it like following your brother to Muhlenberg? </strong>It was pretty cool following my brother here to Muhlenberg. It had its advantages and disadvantages for sure. It was nice because I was familiar with the school before I started here. I would have to say the biggest disadvantage was considering Mickey was such an amazing athlete, it was hard to live up to his potential. How do I beat the all-time leader in points in a career and a season, the all-time leader in assists in a career, season and one game? … Both of my older brothers, Mickey and Sean, have been my role models since I started sports around second grade. I hope that I can be a role model to my little brother Joey, like Mickey and Sean are to me.</p>
<p><strong>What was it like interning with Wenner Media? </strong>It was awesome. I worked with some amazing people and learned so much. The office had so many cool things about it. For instance, they had one long hallway that included every single <em>Rolling Stone</em> magazine cover ever made in order from the first to the most recent. They also had a guitar that Pete Townshend from The Who smashed.</p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans?</strong> I want to work for a public accounting firm out of college for a few years. Hopefully the firm will pay me to go back and get my master’s degree and take the CPA exam. Then I want to get into forensic accounting and fraud examination. One day, I would like to work for the FBI to assist in fraud investigations.</p>
<p><strong>What kind of person is Brittany DeAngelis? </strong>That’s a pretty hard question to answer because honestly, she is an indescribable person. Her work ethic is just remarkable. The way she cares so much about school is evident considering how good her grades are and the awards she has won for being such a great student. Also, her work ethic in field hockey is just as impressive. She is the kind of player that I am sure every coach would hope to have. Most importantly, she is one of my best friends. I am so fortunate to have my best friend be one of my teammates and co-captains throughout my time at Muhlenberg.</p>

<p><strong>What was the Washington Semester like? </strong>My semester in Washington, D.C., was an experience that I will never forget. I fell in love with the city, and my internship provided me with the opportunity to not only live in our nation’s capital, but to also learn about it. We went to our internships during the day and had classes in the evenings. One day a week, we had field trips and explored many of our national monuments. I learned to live in an entirely different environment, and I really enjoyed it.</p>
<p><strong>How have you improved as a player since your freshman year? </strong>I have learned to be a leader on and off the field. I have learned to be able to voice my opinions to others while still knowing that it is important to be a good listener as well. I have also learned composure; I have learned to be patient on defense to allow the offense make the first mistake and then take advantage of that mistake.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans?</strong> After college, I hope my future includes working for a department of the federal government. I would really enjoy working for the FBI or the state department.</p>
<p><strong>What kind of teammate is Renee Norton? </strong>Renee Norton is a great leader. She is a player who is able to keep everyone together and motivated, even through the toughest of times. She is a great listener who is always taking time to help any of her teammates. She is a strong player, always communicating on the field. She is always there supporting the offense while making sure to always recover to help defend. Not only is she a great teammate, but she is a great friend as well.</p>
