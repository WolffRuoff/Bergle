								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the release of the tool “Signal,” social media tech giant Facebook looks to help journalists discover new and spreading content. With the use of social media on the rise, inefficiency comes with it. While sites such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram sit back and enjoy all that’s taking place, social media followers may begin to feel a sense of overcrowding. Posts, happenings, and pictures are just some of the things that typically flood our newsfeeds. But is it all meaningful? Numerous analysts have observed that skipping around and scrolling through feeds trying to find the right post is becoming more common. So what? It’s extremely time consuming and news organizations aren’t receiving the credit they deserve. It has become a hunt and find for many and with all the new ways to share, it can become a bit overwhelming to lots. Facebook wants to change this.</p>
<p>In addition to communicating and sharing with friends, many see Facebook as a place to keep up on current news topics. According to Greenberg, (2015, p. 1) Signal offers a dashboard where journalists can follow trending and emerging topics, track chatter around public figures on a leaderboard, and search to find public conversations, photos, or videos. All in one place. One may be wondering where users seek new stories. Facebook made it clear that users can source articles via hashtags from anywhere on its social media site. I strongly believe that this will benefit both, Facebook users in addition to journalists. When I found out the feature was arriving now, I was blown away.</p>
<p>Facebook has been working endlessly to further lift their strengths and improve upon their weaknesses. Most of them being related to journalists. Just this past week, Facebook gave journalists the permission to live broadcast video using the company’s Mention application. This enhancement takes it not only a step forward, but an entire leap in the right direction. I strongly believe companies such as Facebook who are constantly working to improve and always rolling out updates deserve their place in the market. After reading some of Facebook’s stats in class along with other social media engines, it’s clear that Facebook is on par with competitors and its growth in the past few years have left me in disbelief. This just further exemplifies how much technology is expanding.</p>
<p>The following line is essential to the overall meaning of the article. “Signal is more than just another way for journalists to use Facebook. It’s a way for Facebook to show off the value of Facebook.” (Greenberg, 2015) But, why is this important? This statement sums up Facebook’s goal. Greenberg was absolutely right and makes a valid claim. Signal brings a whole new experience to both Facebook users and journalists. It will increase the value of published articles, make them easier to find, and help journalists predict upcoming trends as well as hot new topics. After all, news is an essential piece of the experience that comes on Facebook. I believe this will fill lots of hopes and further establish who Facebook really is and why they set out to exist. Not only will it help Facebook and news organizations provide relevant topics to millions of users, but it will push the limits of the industry to do the same. And that’s what keeps the world moving forward.</p>
