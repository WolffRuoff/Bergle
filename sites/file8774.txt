								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“I’m Going to Instagram It! An Analysis of Athlete Self-Presentation on Instagram”, by Lauren Reichart Smith and Jimmy Sanderson, is a well developed research article that discusses how athletes portray themselves over Social Media. Sanderson and Smith’s study was fabricated from the principles of Goffman’s notion of self presentation and gender displays. They took this already gratified research and used it as a tool to find a more accurate truth when examining 27 professional athletes&#8217; Instagram feeds to determine how these athletes are using this new visual resource to present themselves to the public and to their fans. Throughout this study we see the capabilities that Social Media has towards athletes who are inaccurately depicted under the public eye solely because of the media. Sanderson and Smith focus in on the influence that Social Media has towards fighting the norm that history has set when discussing gender roles.</p>
<p>Almost every athlete that I know conforms to some type of Social Media. Their reasoning behind which Social Media they elect to partake in varies tremendously, but the benefits of each resource remains consistent. As described by Sanderson and Smith, Social Media is ‘‘Architected by design to readily support participation, peer-to-peer conversation, collaboration, and community’’, so even though their motives differ, Social Media still appears to touch all athletes due to the fact that it’s easily accessible; it allows each athlete as an individual to reach out to his or her fans on a more personal level and it offers them a sense of community and belonging. Seemingly enough, we find all of those same incentives that are instilled within Social Media can be found in every major sport in our society. As well as containing the ability to depict a certain aspect of community, Social Media also gives each athlete a say on a personal level. Sanderson and Smith prove that the influence of Social Media gives professional athletes the capability to express their stance when analyzing a prior dispute between Boston Red Sox pitcher Curt Schilling after he was accused of faking an injury along with criticizing fellow player Barry Bonds. Immediately after hearing the allegations, Schilling fought back with the only credible resource he has access to, his blog. Curt opposed the rumors that the media had been spreading and defended his well being. Interestingly enough while in the process of setting his story straight, Curt developed a sense of respect from his fans for taking the offense against the media critics. So, not only did Social Media give Schilling the ability to maintain his reputation, but it also improved it in the process. Just one of the many stories that Sanderson and Smith touch upon that illustrate the idea that the power of Social Media is infinite.</p>
<p>Although this study found that Social Media gives athletes a declaration when confronting issues derived from the media, it focused more on some very compelling findings on the conventions, habits, and deeper meanings behind professional athlete’s photos along with their captions when looking at posts on Instagram. Social media not only combats the media, but it also creates opportunities for each athlete to show a more accurate depiction of who they truly are. Within these findings, Sanderson and Smith found that the “Majority of the photos framed the athlete from a distant perspective, showing off the entire body”. The reason this is so fascinating is because throughout history, people that upheld immense stature within our society veered towards having head shots to display themselves rather than a whole body shot. Social media unintentionally established a method to alter the standard that society had set on how a high standard individual “should” portray themselves. When pertaining to female athletes, Sanderson and Smith noticed that many “take this opportunity to buck the trend of visual representations found in the media, and present themselves as athletes first, females second”. Once again, we see how Social media takes a stand towards the image that history has created for our society. Using Social Media, female athletes now have a legitimate resource, allowing them to provide valid “hype” and “status” as to why they should be considered serious athletes.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Social Media contains the ability to give not only professional athletes, but every man and woman fair representation of who they truly are. In addition to allowing them to illustrate themselves, it allows a window of creativity, to simulate an image of what they want to be. Social Media has no laws, prejudgments, or set norms of what an individual can be. It only assists each person, allowing them to find who they truly are as an individual. As Social Media continues to grow, one can only imagine the impacts it will have on not only our self representation but our society as well.</p>
