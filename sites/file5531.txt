<p><strong>Cross Country at Cedar Crest/Muhlenberg Invitational (Saturday, 10:00)<br />
</strong></p>
<p>The Mules compete in the closest thing they have to a home meet, crossing Ott Street to race for the first time in three weeks. Last year, the Muhlenberg teams swept this meet for the first time since 2008. Both Mule squads are ranked in the top 10 in the Mideast Region.</p>
<p><strong>Volleyball vs. Johns Hopkins (Saturday, 1:00)</strong></p>
<p>The two-time defending Centennial Conference champion Blue Jays kick off (or is it serve off?) the on-campus Homecoming activities. Hopkins comes in 5-4, with all of its losses coming to nationally ranked teams, while Muhlenberg is 6-4. Johns Hopkins holds a 16-5 series lead and has won 10 of the last 11 meetings.</p>
<p>Live stats: <a href="http://www.muhlenberg.edu/sports/vblive/topview.htm">http://www.muhlenberg.edu/sports/vblive/topview.htm</a></p>
<p><strong>Football vs. McDaniel (Saturday, 2:00)</strong></p>
<p>McDaniel nearly spoiled Homecoming two years ago, opening up a 26-7 lead before the Mules rallied with 27 fourth-quarter points. The Green Terror beat Moravian last weekend to snap a 13-game losing streak, while Muhlenberg is coming off a 28-21 loss at Franklin &amp; Marshall. McDaniel leads the all-time series, 22-18-3, but the Mules have won the last three meetings, rolling up a 413-168 margin in total yards in last year&#8217;s 33-0 shutout.</p>
<p>Green Terror senior running back Joe Rollins will be a player to watch, and one to tackle for the Muhlenberg defense. He rushed for 219 yards last week and is the ninth all-time leading rusher in Centennial Conference history.</p>

<p><strong>Women&#8217;s Soccer vs. Johns Hopkins (Saturday, 3:00)</strong></p>
<p>Johns Hopkins (8-0) soared to the top spot of the D3soccer.com Division III rankings after scoring road wins against then-No. 1 Messiah and then-No. 5 Carnegie Mellon. The Blue Jays are 37-4 in the Centennial Conference regular season over the last four-plus years, but three of those losses were to Muhlenberg, each time with Hopkins ranked in the top 10. The Mules (3-2-1) will look to make history repeat &#8211; again. They come in with a four-match unbeaten streak and an unscored-upon streak of 380 minutes.</p>

<p>The last home event of Homecoming matches two teams that dominated the early days of the Centennial Conference, combining to win five of the first seven titles, but both failed to make the playoffs last year. Muhlenberg (4-2) is ranked eighth in the Mid-Atlantic Region, while Gettysburg (0-5) has lost eight straight dating back to last season. Included in the Bullets&#8217; setbacks is a 3-1 loss to Neumann, who the Mules beat. Muhlenberg holds a 35-18-6 series lead and is 8-0-1 against Gettysburg since the 2005 regular season.</p>

			<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/09/hacketths.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1872" alt="Brad Hackett" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/09/hacketths.jpg" width="100" height="150" /></a>Muhlenberg track and field coach Brad Hackett never planned on writing a book. But after 30 years of coaching, there were just so many stories to tell.</p>
<p>With <i>If All I Had To Do Was Coach</i>, Hackett gives readers a glimpse into the always-interesting life of a track and field coach. The first of many unforgettable anecdotes littered throughout Hackett’s first book gave him the nudge he needed to do something he never thought he would.</p>
<p>In 1993, when Hackett was in the middle of his nearly 10 years as an assistant coach at Syracuse, the school was set to host the high school national indoor championships. More than 1,500 athletes from all 50 states descended upon the Carrier Dome on a frozen March day. Soon, they would have nowhere to go.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/09/Hackett_book_cover.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1870" alt="Hackett_book_cover" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/09/Hackett_book_cover.jpg" width="350" height="501" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/09/Hackett_book_cover.jpg 350w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/09/Hackett_book_cover-209x300.jpg 209w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" /></a>An almost unthinkable 54 inches of snow fell in a 24-hour span, sending the city into a state of emergency and trapping more than 5,000 people into the field house. The roof of the Carrier Dome was let down before the governors of Rhode Island and New York and the National Guard got involved, and somehow the meet was able to go off. After that, Hackett had the story that started it all.</p>
<p>“That was the beginning,” said Hackett, who has coached at Muhlenberg since 1999. “People kept on saying, ‘oh, you were around and you never slept for 72 hours. Think of all the things that happened; you could write a book about that,’” Hackett recalled. “So I ended up turning that into a chapter of the book.”</p>
<p>The rest of Hackett’s story, however, took many years to come out. By the time he left Syracuse in 1997, Hackett had written four or five chapters of the book, but he let it sit in an envelope for more than a decade. Coincidentally, another trip to upstate New York was all he needed to dive back in.</p>
<div id="attachment_1871" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/09/hackett_coaching.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1871" class="size-medium wp-image-1871" alt="Hackett has coached more than 50 Centennial Conference gold medalists, including pole vaulter Erin Saucier." src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/09/hackett_coaching-300x240.jpg" width="300" height="240" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/09/hackett_coaching-300x240.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/09/hackett_coaching.jpg 375w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-1871" class="wp-caption-text">Hackett has coached more than 50 Centennial Conference gold medalists, including pole vaulter Erin Saucier.</p></div>
<p>With his wife at Colgate’s 25<sup>th</sup> college reunion in 2008, Hackett looked around and saw accomplished, wildly successful classmates everywhere he looked. Bob Woodruff, the television news anchor. Austin Murphy, a well-known writer for <i>Sports Illustrated. </i>And don’t forget <i>SportsCenter </i>anchor David Lloyd.</p>
<p>“On the way home, I said to my wife, ‘look what these people have done. What have I done?’” Hackett recalled. “That was the impetus to get the ball rolling again and finish it.”</p>
<p>After that, the stories came flowing out of his pen. He finished the writing process in a mere three or four months that summer.</p>
<p>“I started to realize I had had seven or eight incidents driving a van coming home from a meet, six or seven incidents with a bad hotel or a bunch of really interesting characters or kids that have done bizarre things,” Hackett said. “I started putting it into an outline of categories, and from there it became apparent that was the style I was going to go with. It was as if I’m sitting in a bar telling people a bunch of different stories.”</p>
<div id="attachment_1873" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/09/wtrk05.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1873" class="size-full wp-image-1873" alt="Hackett coached the women's track and field team to a Centennial Conference championship in 2005." src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/09/wtrk05.jpg" width="500" height="341" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/09/wtrk05.jpg 500w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/09/wtrk05-300x204.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/09/wtrk05-439x300.jpg 439w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-1873" class="wp-caption-text">Hackett coached the women&#8217;s track and field team to a Centennial Conference championship in 2005.</p></div>
<p>After the writing process was complete, it was a matter of finding the right person to publish it. At first, the book was met with skepticism or outright rejection, but another stroke of good fortune set everything in motion.</p>
<p>Hackett was speaking at a clinic hosted by a good friend, who happened to be a friend of the owner of Coaches Choice Publishing. The company liked what Hackett had to say, and the partnership was born. After several years of back-and-forth exchanges, the book’s editor got involved this summer, opening Hackett’s eyes to the rigors of publishing a book.</p>
<p>“The writing of it was easy,” Hackett said. “It was a narrative…I had told every one of those stories a million times. The interesting part to me was the final stage, the editorial process.</p>
<p>“I made an assumption that an editor of a book is making grammatical changes, and nothing could be farther from the truth. She went through every story with a fine-tooth comb.”</p>
<p>Hackett recalls hosting recruits at Syracuse on the night of the 1996 NCAA basketball championship between the Orange and Kentucky. The way Hackett remembered it, all five of Syracuse’s starters in that game were drafted into the NBA the following year. Not so, said his editor. Further research revealed that not all of those players were drafted. After other investigations, Hackett had a perfectly accurate product.</p>
<p>“That was the part that amazed me, the level of investigating my editor did to verify that everything I was saying was accurate,” Hackett said.</p>
<p>Hackett isn’t exactly a writing neophyte. He had published articles in track and field technical magazines. He enjoyed coming up with a premise and attempting to prove it, an early precursor to his first book. In <i>If All I Had To Do Was Coach</i>, Hackett hopes others in the track and field community will find stories that resonate with them, that remind them of similar experiences.</p>
<div id="attachment_1869" style="width: 260px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/09/hackett_hurdles.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1869" class="size-full wp-image-1869" alt="Moving hurdles is one of things Hackett has to do in addition to coaching." src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/09/hackett_hurdles.jpg" width="250" height="399" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-1869" class="wp-caption-text">Moving hurdles is one of things Hackett has to do in addition to coaching.</p></div>
<p>“I look at this book as an opportunity for me to give back to the sport that has given me so much,” Hackett said. “I’m hoping some people that are not familiar with the sport – even though the book isn’t about track, it’s about a track and field coach – will have a little more of an understanding of what college coaching is like, and what coaching track and field is like, more specifically.</p>
<p>“If it’s popular enough within the coaching community that a lot of people read it, I would suspect that people would start to say to me, ‘hey, that story reminds me of something that happened to our team.’”</p>
<p>Despite its bevy of fascinating stories, Hackett says the beauty of the book is its commonality.</p>
<p>“I’ve got to believe that anyone who has been coaching as long as I have has encountered similar situations,” he said. “These stories could have happened to anybody.”</p>
<p>Now that he’s put those stories on paper, Hackett doesn’t plan on doing it again anytime soon. Still, it wasn’t something he expected to do the first time around. As any track and field coach can tell you, the stories never stop.</p>
<p>“I never dreamed,” Hackett said, “of doing something like this.”</p>
<p><i>If All I Had To Do Was Coach </i>is available at the Colgate University and Muhlenberg College bookstores, as well as CoachesChoice.com, MFathletics.com, Venuesports.com, and Amazon.</p>

			<p><em>A look at the top plays from last week.</em></p>
<p><strong>Female Play of the Week &#8211; Bridget McNally, Field Hockey</strong></p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t exactly a &#8220;pick-six&#8221; &#8211; maybe a &#8220;pick-one&#8221; or &#8220;pick-five.&#8221; With the Mules ahead 4-1 in the second half against King&#8217;s, McNally intercepted a pass and took it 47 yards &#8220;to the house,&#8221; finishing for her second goal of the game and putting the exclamation point on a 5-1 win.</p>
<p><strong>Male Play of the Week &#8211; Ellison Heil, Soccer</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg led 2-0 early in the second half against Moravian when Heil came to the edge of the goalie box to punch a ball away. Unfortunately, it went right to another Greyhound player. As the clip begins, Heil is retreating to the goal, and he gets there just in time and has enough spring in his legs to turn away the Moravian volley. The Mules scored a minute later and went on to win, 4-0.</p>
<p><strong>Honorable Mention &#8211; Nick Palladino to Cody Geyer, Football</strong></p>
<p>The duo hooked up on a 54-yard touchdown pass in the fourth quarter of the Mules&#8217; 28-21 loss at Franklin &amp; Marshall. For Palladino, it was the longest scoring strike thrown by a Muhlenberg freshman since 1995.</p>

<p><strong>Field Hockey vs. McDaniel (Friday, 7:00)</strong></p>
<p>After winning their home opener in decisive fashion (5-1 vs. King&#8217;s) on Wednesday, the Mules stay at home to take on McDaniel in the first Centennial Conference game of the year. The Green Terror (2-2) won its first two games in overtime but has been shut out in its last two outings. Both teams finished 4-6 in the CC last year, and they played an appropriately evenly matched game, with Muhlenberg coming back twice to win 4-3 in overtime. The Mules lead, 11-9, in a series in which the road team has won the last four games.</p>

<p><strong>Football at Franklin &amp; Marshall (Saturday, 1:00)</strong></p>
<p>The defending Centennial Conference runner-up travels to Lancaster to face the team picked to finish second in the 2013 preseason poll. The teams&#8217; openers could not have been much different, with Muhlenberg rolling past The Apprentice School, 59-6, and the Diplomats losing to Washington and Lee, 14-13, on a failed two-point conversion in the final 30 seconds.</p>
<p>Franklin &amp; Marshall leads the all-time series, 52-43-1, but the Mules won the last two meetings by three touchdowns, including last season&#8217;s 21-0 shutout. Muhlenberg starting QB Joe Carlucci is the older brother of F&amp;M backup Anthony Carlucci, who played the second half of last year&#8217;s game.</p>

<p><strong>Volleyball at McDaniel (Saturday, 12:00); vs. Goucher (Saturday, 2:00)</strong></p>
<p>The Mules (4-4), who split on their first two weekends of play in 2013, will try to sweep this tri-match, just like they did last year, when they beat McDaniel in four sets and Goucher in three. The Green Terror (3-2), two years removed from a winless season, is improving but carries a 22-match CC losing streak into this contest. McDaniel leads the all-time series, 15-6, although Muhlenberg has won three of the last five. Goucher is 6-3.</p>

<p><strong>Women&#8217;s Soccer at McDaniel (Saturday, 4:00)</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg (2-2) takes its two-game winning streak into its CC opener against McDaniel, which outscored its first three opponents by a 16-0 margin before suffering a 4-2 loss to York on Wednesday. The Mules allowed only three goals in CC games last year, but one of them was to McDaniel in a 1-0 loss to open the league season. Muhlenberg went on to finish 6-3-1 and earn a playoff berth, while McDaniel ended at 2-7-1. The Mules lead the series, 13-6-1, and had not lost to the Green Terror since 2003 before last year.</p>

			<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/09/germaskehs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1832" alt="Christine Germaske" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/09/germaskehs.jpg" width="100" height="150" /></a>Tomorrow night, the Muhlenberg field hockey team will try to get a jump start on the rest of the Centennial Conference when it hosts McDaniel in the first league game of the year (most other CC teams open up conference play on Saturday or later). And if there’s one player on the team who knows plenty about getting an early start, it’s Christine Germaske.</p>
<p>The junior forward spent the summer interning with Scott &amp; Todd in the Morning, the popular radio show hosted by veterans Scott Shannon and Todd Pettengill on WPLJ 95.5 in New York.</p>
<p>“It was fun. I loved it and really loved everyone I worked with,” said Germaske.</p>
<p>The only downside was the hours. Germaske would wake up at 2:50 a.m. at her home in Raritan, N.J., and take a 4:00 train from New Brunswick to Manhattan. She worked from 5:00 to 10:00 and arrived back home at noon to take a nap, her full day of work complete.</p>
<p>Germaske discovered the opportunity on the Internet, interviewed with one of the producers and found out just a few days later that she had gotten the job. She was one of five interns and did not receive any pay or academic credit for her time. To make some money over the summer, she worked at a J. Crew store some night and on weekends.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/09/germaske_degraw.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1833" alt="with Gavin DeGraw" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/09/germaske_degraw.jpg" width="450" height="349" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/09/germaske_degraw.jpg 450w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/09/germaske_degraw-300x232.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/09/germaske_degraw-386x300.jpg 386w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a>So what did her duties entail? When she arrived at 5:00, her first job was to put together a packet of newspaper clippings for Scott and Todd to talk about on the air. During the show, she worked the phones, taking listener comments and occasionally passing them on to the hosts as well as picking up the phone for on-air contests.</p>
<p>Then there were trips to pick up items for the hosts, including Todd’s daily Diet Coke. Germaske also got to meet in-studio guests like musicians Gavin DeGraw <em>(pictured above)</em> and Demi Lovato and television health guru Dr. Oz.</p>
<p>“It was cool to work with celebrities,” Germaske said. “People think they’re selfish and demanding, but they were all really nice. I didn’t expect that.”</p>
<p>Germaske, who scored her second goal of the season in last night’s 5-1 win against King’s, made it on air on several occasions. Once, she was sent to SoHo (her first subway ride) to stand in line for a cronut, the croissant-doughnut hybrid that became all the rage this year. While she was waiting, Scott and Todd called her to ask her about the type of people who were in line.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/09/germaske_kings.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1834" alt="Christine Germaske" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/09/germaske_kings.jpg" width="300" height="575" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/09/germaske_kings.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/09/germaske_kings-156x300.jpg 156w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>When she exited the store, Germaske was interviewed by a television station about her cronut experience, making for a memorable day.</p>
<p>Another time, Germaske sat in with the hosts and producers to provide another voice for a morning discussion on topics such as the hit song “Blurred Lines.”</p>
<p>“I was there to laugh or add input, but I didn’t know how to just jump in!” she said. “I was like, I’m just a 20-year-old girl and you’ve been doing this a long time.”</p>
<p>Germaske admitted a little nervousness at being on the air on a popular show airing in a big city. “I was trying not to think about how many people were listening,” she said. “You just have to think that you’re having a normal conversation with the other people in the room.”</p>
<p>Germaske’s last day at the station was August 2 – right before she left for Europe with her Mule teammates. And although she sees her future in business, not necessarily show business, she did learn many valuable life lessons from her summer internship.</p>
<p>“I learned professionalism – you have to act like a grownup,” she said. “And I learned people skills, and the ability to work with people who are older than you, and being able to put a smile on every morning even though it was 5:00.</p>
<p>“I also learned about the ability to produce work quickly, and to be able to drop what you were doing to get something for someone and then go back to what you were doing.</p>

			<p><em>Muhlenberg&#8217;s athletes of the week for the opening weekend and first full week of competition for the 2013-14 school year.</em></p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft" alt="" src="http://www.muhlenberg.edu/images/main/athletics/men/crosscountry/hs/xc13/croninhs.jpg" width="100" height="150" />Female Athlete of the Week &#8211; Nicki Cronin, Cross Country</strong></p>
<p>Cronin<em></em> finished fifth overall, and first among Division III runners, at the Lehigh Valley Invitational. Cronin was the only non-Division I athlete in the top 20 and recorded the second-best finish ever by a Mule at the meet. The Centennial Conference runner of the week led Muhlenberg to a sixth-place showing – first among seven Division III teams.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/09/attanasiohs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1823" alt="attanasiohs" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/09/attanasiohs.jpg" width="100" height="150" /></a>Male Athlete of the Week &#8211; Bryan Attanasio, Men&#8217;s Soccer</strong></p>
<p>The defense carried the way for the men&#8217;s soccer team in its first three wins of the season, allowing only five shots on goal in shutouts of Neumann, Wilkes and Ithaca. Attanasio, the starting right back, was a big part of that, and he also contributed to the offense. His free kicks directly led to two of the Mules&#8217; four goals in the three games, including the double-overtime winner against Ithaca.</p>

<p><strong>Volleyball hosts Buttermaker Tournament (Friday vs. Penn State Abington, 3:00; Friday vs. Neumann, 7:00; Saturday opponents TBD, 10:00 and 2:00)</strong></p>
<p>The 16<sup>th</sup> annual tournament will feature 18 matches among nine teams in a period of about 25 hours. Muhlenberg (2-2) is looking for its first Buttermaker title since 2005. Defending champion Salisbury has to be considered the favorite to repeat; the Seagulls (37-4 last year) come in ranked 22<sup>nd</sup> in the Division III preseason poll and are off to a 4-0 start. The Mules’ first two opponents have already been swept by Centennial Conference teams – Penn State Abington (0-3) by McDaniel and Neumann (1-3) by Haverford.</p>

<p><strong>Football vs. The Apprentice School (Saturday, 1:00)</strong></p>
<p>The Mules open their 112<sup>th</sup> season of football with their only non-conference game of the season. Last year, in the first meeting between the two schools, Muhlenberg fell into an early 7-0 hole before rallying to win, 27-7, en route to an 8-3 campaign that included a bid to the ECAC South Atlantic Bowl. The Builders finished up at 2-8. Both teams will feature new faces on both sides of the ball. The Mules have won six of their last seven home openers, and when their first home game has been in the afternoon, they haven’t lost since 2003.</p>

<p><strong>Men’s Soccer vs. Ithaca (Saturday, 4:00)</strong></p>
<p>The last time these two teams squared off on Varsity Field, Muhlenberg won 4-0 in a 1995 NCAA Tournament quarterfinal match, earning a trip to its only “Final Four.” The teams didn’t play again until last season, when Ithaca made an early goal stand up in a 1-0 win. The Mules (2-1) are ranked ninth in the Mid-Atlantic Region and come in with two straight shutouts. The Bombers (0-2), the defending Empire 8 co-champions, took nationally ranked Oneonta State to overtime in their season opener.</p>

<p><strong>Women’s Soccer at Gwynedd-Mercy (Saturday, 12:00) and vs. Delaware Valley (Sunday, 2:00)</strong></p>
<p>The Mules go back-to-back for the second straight weekend after losing a pair of matches to regionally ranked opponents last weekend. Last year, Muhlenberg played these teams in the opposite order, defeating Gwynedd-Mercy 1-0 in overtime a day after losing to Delaware Valley by the same score. Gwynedd is 0-2-1 to start the 2013 season, while DelVal is 1-1.</p>

<p><strong>Men’s Soccer vs. Rutgers-Camden (Friday, 5:00) and vs. Neumann (Saturday, 5:00)</strong></p>
<p>Men’s soccer is the only team at home this weekend, and it will face some tough competition.
