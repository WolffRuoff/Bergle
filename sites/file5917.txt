<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/maydenhs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-53" title="Samantha Mayden" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/maydenhs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Female Athlete of the Month &#8211; Samantha Mayden, Cross Country</strong></p>
<p>Mayden took the starting line three times last month and finished third, first and second. Only one Division III runner beat her; she finished behind two runners from Delaware at the Lehigh Invitational and won the Mule/Falcon Classic by a considerable margin. She came in second at the Dickinson Long/Short Invitational last Saturday. Mayden&#8217;s performances helped the Mules to a No. 7 ranking in the Mideast Region.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/10/antoninihs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1397" title="Cody Antonini" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/10/antoninihs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Male Athlete of the Month &#8211; Cody Antonini, Men&#8217;s Soccer</strong></p>
<p>After a year off, Antonini returned to the Mules and returned to the form that made him an All-American in 2009 and 2010. He scored seven goals in the first eight games of the season to become the 16th player in Centennial Conference history with 40 career goals. Antonini scored at least one goal in six of the eight games, helping the Mules to a 5-3 record and a regional ranking.</p>

			<p><em>The last time every Muhlenberg team was on the road, two weekends ago, it turned out to be a very successful day, with the Mules going 5-1 at McDaniel. How will the road trips go tomorrow? Here&#8217;s a short preview:</em></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-104" title="Mule Marquee Matchup" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1-300x203.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="203" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1-300x203.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Men&#8217;s Soccer at Haverford (Saturday, 1:00)</strong></p>
<p>The Mules (5-2, 2-1) look to bounce back from last night&#8217;s home loss to Swarthmore with a game against defending Centennial Conference runner-up Haverford (5-4, 2-1). The teams are currently tied for second place in the CC, just a point behind Swarthmore and Dickinson. Haverford&#8217;s lone CC loss was to Johns Hopkins, a team Muhlenberg beat.</p>
<p>The series has been one-sided since the start of CC play, with the Mules winning 17 of 19 meetings. The Fords&#8217; lone series win during that span came in 2001 (the 1998 game ended in a tie). Muhlenberg won 2-0 last year.</p>

<p><strong>Cross Country at Dickinson Long/Short Invitational</strong></p>
<p>It will be the biggest meet of the season to date for both Mule teams, who took first place at Cedar Crest last week. The women, ranked seventh in the region, will compete against two of the teams ranked ahead of them – Dickinson (2) and Elizabethtown (6).</p>

<p><strong>Field Hockey at Dickinson (Saturday, 11:00)</strong></p>
<p>Both of these teams were 5-12 last year. The Mules (5-3, 1-2) have already matched their 2011 win total, and the Red Devils (4-5, 0-3) are just one away. All five of Muhlenberg&#8217;s wins are by one goal, two in overtime, and Dickinson has played a pair of overtime games. Last year the teams played a wild game that came down to the final seconds, with the Mules holding on for a 4-3 win.</p>
<p><strong>Volleyball at Dickinson (Saturday, 11:30)</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg (8-5, 1-2) is looking to get back on the winning track after dropping back-to-back CC matches to Haverford and Johns Hopkins last week. Dickinson (1-11, 0-3) has lost seven straight. The Mules have not won in Carlisle since 2001 but took last year&#8217;s meeting at home, 3-1. </p>
<p><strong>Football at Susquehanna (Saturday, 1:00)</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg (3-1, 2-1) looks to bounce back from its first loss of the season, last week to Johns Hopkins, against a Susquehanna team that, although winless in the Centennial Conference, is still dangerous. The Crusaders (1-3, 0-3) led undefeated Gettysburg in the fourth quarter last week and lead the CC with a plus-8 turnover margin. The Mules are plus-5 themselves and have not turned the ball over in their last 10 quarters.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg leads the series, 11-9, and has won both meetings since Susquehanna joined the CC for football. The Mules travel well, especially on defense &#8211; they&#8217;ve allowed one touchdown or fewer in five of their last eight road games.</p>

<p><strong>Women&#8217;s Soccer at Dickinson, 5:00</strong></p>
<p>This will be Muhlenberg&#8217;s fifth game against an opponent ranked in the top 10 in the region. The Mules (3-6-1, 1-2) beat Johns Hopkins (3t), lost to Messiah (1) by three and suffered one-goal losses to Haverford (3t) and Wilkes (9t). Dickinson (6-2, 1-1), ranked sixth in the region, also lost 1-0 to Haverford and is coming off a 2-0 loss to Messiah. The Red Devils have won the last five series meetings, the last two by a final of 1-0.</p>

			<p>Muhlenberg welcomes five Johns Hopkins teams for some key games on Homecoming Weekend. Plus, the cross country teams have a race just a few blocks from campus.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-104" title="Mule Marquee Matchup" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="237" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg 350w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1-300x203.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" /></a>Football vs. Johns Hopkins (Saturday, 2:00)</strong></p>
<p>Johns Hopkins vs. Muhlenberg is always one of the big games in Centennial Conference football, and this year is no exception. Both teams have dominated their first three opponents, the Blue Jays outscoring them 119-35 and the Mules 81-7.</p>
<p>Hopkins, ranked 16th in one Division III poll and 24th in another, brings in a regular-season winning streak of 17 games. Muhlenberg has won six straight at home, the last three by shutout.</p>
<p>The Mules are the only Division III team to have played three games this season and allowed no more than one touchdown. (In all NCAA divisions, the only other schools to do that are Division II Indiana (Pa.) and FBS Florida State.) They&#8217;ll be challenged to keep that streak alive against a Blue Jay offense that averages nearly 500 yards per game.</p>
<p>The winner of this game has gone on to play in the NCAA Tournament every year but one since 2001.</p>

<p><strong>Field Hockey vs. Johns Hopkins (Friday, 7:00)</strong></p>
<p>Two teams coming off losses to nationally ranked opponents look to get back on the winning track. The Mules (4-2, 1-1) fell to No. 12 Haverford, 2-0, on Wednesday, while the Blue Jays (3-3, 0-1) lost to No. 1 New Jersey, 5-1, on Sunday. Hopkins also dropped its CC opener to Washington, 2-1 in overtime.</p>
<p>The Blue Jays lead the all-time series, 16-5, but Muhlenberg&#8217;s last two wins came in 2008 and 2009 when Hopkins was ranked in the top 10 in Division.III.</p>

<p><strong>Volleyball vs. Johns Hopkins (Friday, 7:00)</strong></p>
<p>The young Muhlenberg (8-4, 1-1) team will face a challenge in a Hopkins squad that has won 26 consecutive regular-season matches and is receiving votes in the national Division III poll. </p>

<p><strong>Cross Country at Falcon Classic (Saturday, 10:00)</strong></p>
<p>The Muhlenberg teams compete for the first time in three weeks at a meet in which they have had success. One or both Mule squads took first place the last three times they&#8217;ve run in this meet, including the men last year.</p>
<p><strong>Women&#8217;s Soccer vs. Johns Hopkins (Saturday, 3:00)</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg looks to avoid going to 0-3 in the CC against a Johns Hopkins team that is ranked sixth in Division III and has won 14 straight CC games. The last loss before that streak started was in the last meeting in Allentown; the Mules beat Blue Jay teams ranked in the top 10 in both 2009 and 2010.</p>

<p><strong>Men&#8217;s Soccer vs. Johns Hopkins (Saturday, 7:00)</strong></p>
<p>The Homecoming Weekend athletic slate concludes with what is always an entertaining matchup. The Mules (4-1, 1-0) and Blue Jays (3-3, 1-0) have combined for 13 championships in the CC&#8217;s 19-year history. Muhlenberg, ranked seventh in the Mid-Atlantic Region, is winless (0-5-2) against Hopkins since 2005, although only one of those games was decided by more than one goal.</p>

			<p>It&#8217;s opening weekend of the 2012-13 season, and all seven Muhlenberg fall sports teams are in action &#8211; three at home, three others close by and one in Virginia. Here&#8217;s a quick look:</p>
<p><strong>Men&#8217;s Soccer vs. Elizabethtown (Friday, 5:00); vs. Cortland State (Saturday, 5:00)</strong></p>
<p>The Mules (10-6-1 last year) renew an old rivalry with Elizabethtown (10-7) in their season opener. In the late 1980s and early-to-mid 1990s, Muhlenberg and Elizabethtown were two of the &#8220;Big Three&#8221; (along with Messiah) of the Mid-Atlantic Region. The Blue Jays were the visitors for the first night game at Varsity Field in 1997. The teams haven&#8217;t met since 2008. Muhlenberg did play Cortland State (3-8-5) last year, winning 3-2.</p>

<p><strong>Women&#8217;s Soccer vs. Wilkes (Friday, 7:00); vs. Penn State Altoona (Saturday, 7:00)</strong></p>
<p>The Mules open their season against two teams that were in the postseason last year. Wilkes (8-6-3) made the Freedom Conference playoffs, while Penn State Altoona (14-5-3) lost the Allegheny Mountain Collegiate Conference championship game on penalty kicks and earned a bid to the ECAC South Tournament. After this weekend, Muhlenberg (6-10-2) has six straight road games over the next three weeks.</p>

<p><strong>Field Hockey vs. Scranton (Friday, 7:00); vs. Elizabethtown (Saturday, 2:00)</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg (5-12) played the same two opponents on opening weekend last year, losing to both on the road. Scranton was 12-6 last season, and Elizabethtown was 10-7, with both falling in the first round of their conference playoffs.</p>

<p><strong>Volleyball at Greyhound Premiere Invitational (starts Friday at 4:00)</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg (10-18 last year) starts the season with matches against Wilkes (3-22), King&#8217;s (3-20), Wesley (5-26) and host Moravian (23-13). The last time the Mules were in this tournament, 2008, they went 3-1 to finish in second place.</p>

<p><strong>Cross Country at Lehigh Invitational (Friday, 5:30)</strong></p>
<p>For the ninth straight year, the Mules open up at Lehigh&#8217;s Goodman Campus Course in a field that includes Division I opponents Lehigh, Lafayette and Mount St. Mary&#8217;s. Last year, Samantha Mayden was the top Division III runner in the women&#8217;s race, coming in seventh overall.</p>
<p><strong>Football at The Apprentice School (Saturday, 1:00)</strong></p>
<p>The last time the Mules were scheduled to play a regular-season game in Newport News (at Christopher Newport in 2003), the game was cancelled by Hurricane Isabel. No danger of that this year as Muhlenberg (7-3 last year) opens its 111th season with its first game ever against the Builders (2-8).</p>

			<p><em>&#8220;I can&#8217;t believe I am already done with my first semester here at Muhlenberg. It seems like it was just yesterday that I was being moved into my dorm room &#8230;&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Time flies, especially when you are a busy college student-athlete. We asked several Muhlenberg freshman athletes, all of whom completed or are currently in the middle of their seasons, to write about their first-semester experiences and how they were able to adjust academically, athletically and socially. Here&#8217;s what they had to say:</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/12/dosshs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-641" title="Becca Doss" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/12/dosshs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Becca Doss, Cross Country</strong></p>
<p>Joining a team was an adjustment in itself. I went from being a top runner with the same girls for six years to being at the back of the pack on a completely new team.</p>
<p>Despite this, the team definitely made the whole college adjustment nice and smooth. The upperclassmen have been really great about showing us freshmen the wonders of Muhlenberg (like the fro-yo machine, good study spots, the cross country house, etc.). It amazes me how quickly we have become so close.</p>
<p>The commitment has really helped me with time management and keeping an academic focus. It was hard at first to see people getting ready to go out Friday nights while I stayed in to do homework. But I also chilled with teammates and it was all right because we were all in it together.</p>
<p>Even after that and after waking up early every Saturday morning, our performances were worth the sacrifices. We work really hard and have a lot of fun and are always there for each other. I wouldn’t trade the experience for anything.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/12/fiorettihs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-636" title="Krissy Fioretti" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/12/fiorettihs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Krissy Fioretti, Women&#8217;s Soccer</strong></p>
<p>When I got to school, the only thing I knew for sure was that preseason was going to be really challenging and really hot. I got recruited by other schools, but not Muhlenberg, so I didn’t know if I was even going to make the team. I didn’t really know what to expect, but I knew it would be a lot different from high school. I almost didn’t play because I was so nervous I wouldn’t like it.</p>
<p>About two weeks in, I knew I made the right choice. I love everyone on the team and am so glad I got to meet them all. We have great team chemistry led by the best captains and I couldn’t have asked to be on a better team for my first season.</p>
<p>The biggest adjustment was definitely the speed of play. I learned right away that I would have to work really hard to get used to playing at such a fast pace for the entire game. I was very excited to find out I would start on defense in the first game and for the whole season. This surprised me a lot but made me work even harder throughout the season and continue to work hard now that season is over.</p>
<p>The change to college academics was a lot less difficult than I anticipated. I have always had to balance sports and school, so it was exactly what I was used to, and my high school did a great job preparing me for college classes. I knew what to expect in them and how to organize all the work I received so I could get it done in a reasonable amount of time.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/12/gimbarhs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-638" title="Ian Gimbar" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/12/gimbarhs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Ian Gimbar, Football</strong></p>
<p>There was a huge adjustment I needed to make in terms of my academic workload. Having a busy schedule during the season actually helped me out a lot because it forced me to get as much as I could done in the time I had.</p>
<p>With football, I was very grateful to have gotten a large amount of playing time as a freshman. I had expectations of just getting on the field any way possible, but as I moved up the depth chart and some opportunities opened up, I got a chance to see some significant playing time.</p>
<p>The game is much faster and bigger than it was in high school, but in the end, it is still just football.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/12/lesherhs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-639" title="Emily Lesher" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/12/lesherhs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Emily Lesher, Women&#8217;s Basketball</strong></p>
<p>It took me a week or two in the beginning of the semester to adjust to the whole &#8220;college lifestyle.&#8221; For me, the two biggest adjustments were not seeing my family every day and learning how to budget my time so I could get all of my work done. I am very close with my family back at home, so it was challenging for me to adjust to not seeing or talking with them every day.</p>
<p>However, my initial homesickness was eased when I realized that I have &#8220;family&#8221; here: my team. I met all of the other freshman on the team the first day I got here and we instantly started to bond. We became close friends with each other really quickly and supported each other as we all transitioned to life here in Allentown. The upperclassmen on the team also did an amazing job helping us freshmen feel at home &#8230; The team definitely made my transition to college life a million times easier, because they were kind of like a &#8220;built-in&#8221; support system and group of friends.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t played a lot this year, which is difficult (I mean, doesn&#8217;t everyone want to get into games?); however, just being part of the team is amazing. Being able to play with the girls every day at practice is an honor and even if I don&#8217;t get in all that much in the games, I still really enjoy being able to support and cheer everyone on with the other girls on the team.</p>
<p>I have loved my time spent here at Muhlenberg so far, and I am excited for what the second semester has in store for me personally, and for our team!</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/12/pepehs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-640" title="Nicole Pepe" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/12/pepehs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Nicole Pepe, Women&#8217;s Basketball</strong></p>
<p>My first semester of freshman year was one of the most enjoyable experiences I have ever had. Beginning college was a mixture of many different things; it was exciting, but especially nerve-wracking. I was scared to live away from home, make new friends and play on a brand-new team. </p>
<p>All my fears quickly faded. The girls on my team quickly became some of my best friends, and I adjusted to the college lifestyle quicker than I thought I would with the help of my teammates. Balancing playing on the team and my schoolwork was definitely hard, but it is all about time management and setting your priorities.</p>
<p>It has been an amazing experience playing on a team with these girls, and I’ve learned more about the game of basketball than I have learned my whole life. Even though I do not play as much as some of the other girls on my team, I am honored to be part of the team.  The team is a family and we want all of our team to be successful more than anything else. </p>
<p>The bond we all share with each other is something special, and something I am looking forward to see getting stronger as I spend the next four years of my life as part of the Muhlenberg basketball program.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/12/touheyhs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-637" title="Colleen Touhey" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/12/touheyhs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Colleen Touhey, Women&#8217;s Soccer</strong></p>
<p>First semester was awesome! In the beginning it was very difficult adjusting to playing soccer while also balancing my schoolwork. The academics and athletics are more demanding then they were in high school, but once you get into a routine, it is totally manageable!</p>
<p>Having a team that is basically your family makes it worth every minute. There is always someone on the team willing to help you out with school, sports, or whatever it is that you are struggling with.</p>
<p>I got a lot more playing time than I expected to get this season. It was hard to jump right from high school soccer into college soccer. College games move at a much faster pace and are more physical. The upperclassmen on the team were great at getting me ready to compete in this new playing environment. Each game made me more and more confident. By the end of the season I didn&#8217;t feel like a freshmen stepping out onto the field.</p>
<p>Overall, it has been a great experience!</p>

<p>Mayden lands this honor for the third time after placing 11th at the NCAA Mideast Regional to qualify for the NCAA Division III Championships. Her finish was the third-best by a Mule female at the regional meet, and she became the fourth runner in program history to earn all-region honors in back-to-back years. Mayden led the Muhlenberg women to a seventh-place finish, their best ever.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/11/dandridge_bianco.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-484" title="Terrence Dandridge" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/11/dandridge_bianco.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="339" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/11/dandridge_bianco.jpg 375w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/11/dandridge_bianco-300x271.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/11/dandridge_bianco-331x300.jpg 331w" sizes="(max-width: 375px) 100vw, 375px" /></a>Male Athlete of the Week &#8211; Terrence Dandridge, Football</strong></p>
<p>Dandridge earned the Bianco Award as Muhlenberg&#8217;s MVP of the Moravian game after rushing for 126 yards and a touchdown on 22 carries in the Mules&#8217; season-ending 28-0 win. He also caught a pass for 23 yards. Dandridge, pictured receiving the award from Muhlenberg president Randy Helm, is fourth on the program&#8217;s all-time rushing list with 2,314 career yards.</p>

			<p>This weekend features the last two scheduled contests of the fall 2011 season.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-104" title="Mule Marquee Matchup" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="237" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg 350w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1-300x203.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" /></a>Cross Country at NCAA Mideast Regional (Saturday, 11:00 at DeSales); </strong><strong>Football vs. Moravian (Saturday, 1:00)</strong></p>
<p>Three Matte Award points on the line, a chance to qualify for nationals, a season-ending rivalry football game &#8230; great stuff for a fall Saturday.</p>
<p>Almost three months and countless miles after beginning preseason practice, the cross country teams culminate their season at the NCAA Mideast Regional. The women are currently ranked sixth in the region, and they will be trying to acheive the best finish in program history (the 1990 team came in eighth at the regional meet).</p>
<p>Additionally, the women have a shot to send one or more representatives to the NCAA Championships, set for next weekend in Oshkosh, Wis. The top two teams from each region qualify automatically, and the 24 third-through-fifth-place finishers in the eight regions are considered for 16 at-large berths. The top seven individuals not from qualifying teams in each of the eight regions also earn berths.</p>
<p>The football game is the 60th renewal of the traditional season-ending game between Lehigh Valley rivals. Muhlenberg has won nine of the last 13, and the last three were decided by a total of 11 points.</p>
<p>With a win, the Mules (6-3, 6-2) will finish in sole possession of second place in the Centennial Conference.</p>

			<p><em>Senior Kimberlee Yalango of the Muhlenberg women&#8217;s cross country team writes about a conference championship that was memorable, to say the least.</em></p>
<p>As I reflect on this past weekend that the women’s cross country team spent at Dickinson, there are so many events and memories that stick out in my mind. I smile to myself as I remember having giggle fests in our hotel rooms, watching sophomore Kelli Meeker run <a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/11/meeker.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-413" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/11/meeker.jpg" alt="" width="576" height="181" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/11/meeker.jpg 576w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/11/meeker-300x94.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/11/meeker-500x157.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px" /></a>for the first time in a year, and seeing freshman Sarah Costa try every different style of hair on our bus ride home. </p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/11/costa.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-414" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/11/costa.jpg" alt="" width="276" height="208" /></a></p>
<p>But the most memorable event of the weekend that every one of us will never forget was racing together in the October blizzard. Friends and family thought we were insane, and I think I might agree with them. </p>
<p>When we all huddled up before the race, we couldn’t help but laugh at the winter wonderland surrounding us and the dense snowflakes catching on our eyelashes and in our hair. We knew that rain or shine, snow or sleet, we were racing, and we had to just go out there and embrace it. </p>
<p>As the gun went off, the conference jetted forward, or more so drudged through the inches of snow already accumulated on the ground. When we passed through the mile mark, we all were astonished to hear times way off our usual race pace. Time<a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/11/xcsnow5.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-415" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/11/xcsnow5.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="177" /></a>s no longer mattered and the race became purely a test of toughness. </p>
<p>The excitement of running in the snow seemed to wear off after the first mile, especially when we started to enter the rolling hills of the forest. Girls were struggling to climb the hills and were losing balance and falling in the sloshy mess of snow and mud. Yet our team kept trucking through, even after the 90-degree hill thrown in at the 5K mark that seemed to be simply a form of inhumane torture.</p>
<p>As I finished the race, I couldn’t feel anything (literally) but gratitude to be able to put pants on my burning exposed legs. When I finally defrosted hours later, I realized how incredible of a race that was for our team and how close it made us all feel. </p>
<p>So many of our teammates performed extraordinary feats, like Sam Mayden making first-<a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/11/xcsnow6.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-416" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/11/xcsnow6.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="225" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/11/xcsnow6.jpg 350w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/11/xcsnow6-300x192.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" /></a>team all-conference, Erica Bash moving up 57 places from her freshman year, and Melissa Ugelow racing the last collegiate meet of her career and helping the team tie its best place in school history. There wasn’t one person on our team that didn’t sacrifice, whether it was dragging her frigid body through the wintry course or cheering us on from the sidelines in the snowy mess. </p>
<p>While that race was one of the most challenging and intense meets any of us have ever witnessed, I know there’s no other place any of us would have rather been on that snowy Saturday morning.</p>
