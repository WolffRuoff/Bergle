								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Most children from a very young age are taught that lying is bad. They are told it will only get them in more trouble and cause problems. Kids do believe this and try not to lie. But when a child lies and gets away with it he or she won’t understand what the consequences might be if they are caught. This happens primarily online where a kid lies and doesn&#8217;t get caught and therefore sees no repercussions from lying so they continue to do it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The chapter I read was </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Kids Online Lying as the New Social Norm?</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> From the book, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">From Fear to Facebook: One School’s Journey</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> by Matt Levinson. One of the main themes that occurs in the chapter is how more and more kids are lying online. There is no one online to tell the kids that lying is bad online. Levinson writes, “Kids need role models to help them learn, but in online life, there are no adult role models available,” (2010, pp.64). What Levinson is saying is that they have no one to look up to online. Kids have no idea how to act online because there are no role models. How are they supposed to know how to act when there is no supervision. This can be compared to William Golding’s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Lord of the Flies</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> where the boys trapped on the island have no idea how to act with no adult supervision and therefore begin to slowly fall apart. In real life, kids look to their parents or teachers for guidance. But online they look to the other people they are with who sometimes are not the best role models. This is a recipe for disaster because odds are that the other people online with these kids are other kids who might be lying too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Another theme that comes up in the chapter is the dishonest use of cell phones. As more kids are gaining access to mobile devices, it is becoming more easier for them to cheat. Levinson writes, “In the area of cheating, the findings grow more alarming. Of the 1,013 teens surveyed, 35% admit to cheating at least once with their cell phones. Teens are more likely to say that their friends are cheating than they are, as 65% of teens say they have seen or heard about other people in their school cheating with cell phones.” (2010. pp. 66). Cell phones could be considered as hand held cheating devices. It is getting easier to cheat and lie on tests due to cell phones and their ability to take pictures and send text messages. As technology becomes more integrated with our lives, parents and other role models must teach kids that cheating and lying is not okay just because it happens over cyberspace.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Overall, kids are gaining access to technology a lot earlier in their lives than anyone else. Most people gained the access to technology when they were old enough to understand that lying and cheating is bad in real life so they knew not to do it online. Nowadays kids are gaining access to technology before they even realize what is good and bad in real life so they have no idea how to act online. I believe that if parents can teach their children that whatever is not okay in real life probably is not okay online the next generation of children will lie and cheat a lot less.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are many life skills that are essential for survival in our world today. You may find yourself asking right about now what those life skills might be? Just take a minute to think. You probably came up with ideas such as knowing how to swim, or even riding a bike. But did you even think of the things that are more essential such as reading and writing? If not, writer Mike Hanski of the Huffington post might throw his hands up in frustration. The simple skills of reading and writing have the power to bring out who you truly are and what you might aspire to be one day. Overlooking these two skills and forgetting the impact they can have is detrimental. Reading and writing are the driving force in achieving one’s goals and dreams.</p>
<p>In the article “Want to Be a Better Writer? Read More”, Mike Hanski illustrates a scarcity of inspiration and motivation harming the youth of America. Children and many adults today simply do not see the importance in reading and how it can benefit their lives. Well, for starters, Hanski says, “…the more you read at school, the better your vocabulary and cognitive skills become” (Hanski, 2014 p.2). Aside from improving your vocabulary, Hanski also explains how reading can help you overcome stress, increase empathy and on top of that reading can infinitely expand your general view of this world! Reading books and stories not only allow you to travel to other places and other worlds, but they open up a gateway into your own world and imagination.</p>
<p>Now if you are reading this and still see no reason to “waste your time reading” Mike Hanski’s article was written just for you. In his article he does a fantastic job using positive words that hook his readers into thinking “hey I guess reading isn’t that bad after all”. Hanski opens up his article by saying, “Reading is fashionable. Again. It’s cool…” (Hanski, 2014 p.1).  His use of the words “fashionable” and “cool” is to prove that reading should be as popular today as using Facebook or watching TV. On the contrary, Hanski delivers the message that not reading or writing can result in unemployment and illiteracy. His persuasive language throughout the article, both positive and negative relay the importance of these two life skills that should never be overlooked.</p>
