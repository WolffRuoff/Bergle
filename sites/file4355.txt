								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The last two weeks of my study abroad experience in Dublin, Ireland happened to be the same dates for the Dublin Dance Festival (the company I have been interning for throughout the semester). I was so lucky to be able to work with such an incredible team and to help with such a wonderful festival. Over the two week period, Dublin was filled with dance performances.</p>
<div id="attachment_2296" style="width: 230px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/05/DDF1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2296" class="size-medium wp-image-2296" src="http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/05/DDF1-220x300.jpg" alt="" width="220" height="300" srcset="http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/05/DDF1-220x300.jpg 220w, http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/05/DDF1.jpg 704w" sizes="(max-width: 220px) 100vw, 220px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2296" class="wp-caption-text">A Dublin Dance Festival poster just off of Jervis Street in Dublin city.</p></div>
<p>During the first week of the festival, I was assigned as assistant stage manager and artist liaison to SPILL dance company. SPILL dance company is a group that performs free shows for kids in playgrounds using equipment found in the space. I had a great experience with these guys! The choreographer is from Australia, while the company is based in the U.K. The dancers were so much fun to work with! During rehearsals, as we were in playgrounds, we became friends with the local kids who even wanted to help us sweep the space and hand out fliers. The kids were calling us by name as we returned each day throughout the week. It was so cute! The dancers performed in 3 different parks in Dublin. The kids absolutely loved the performances! The show included humor, tricks, and lots of dance.</p>

The audience was packed with excited kids!</p></div>
<p>The second week of the festival I was able to help out with several other performances held in venues all over Dublin city. I saw performances by companies based in places such as Finland, U.K., Belgium, and Australia. The audiences seemed so thrilled after each performance. I felt very proud to be a part of such a great team! On my last day of interning, the team bought me cards and gave me a Dublin Dance Festival poster. I was really sad to say good-bye to each of them, but I am so thankful for everything they have taught me!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am officially done with my abroad experience in Ireland! After taking the group flight into Newark, I immediately hopped on a bus to spend the summer in Allentown. This summer and continuing into my senior year I will be the new Presidential Assistant for Muhlenberg&#8217;s Office of Alumni Relations. But before I share the excitement of being back on campus, I want to first reflect on my experiences over the past 4 months.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think I could fully put into words how much the past four months has amazed me, challenged me, inspired me, changed me, and overall made me so incredibly happy. I have been back less than a week and I already miss it dearly! What do I miss the most? Well, I would have to say I&#8217;ll miss the little things. Here are my top 3 little moments of Dublin that will be missed.</p>
<p><strong>1.Strolls in St. Stephen&#8217;s Green</strong></p>
<p>St. Stephen&#8217;s Green in a small park in the city of Dublin. I will miss taking strolls with a cookie hot chocolate in hand!</p>
<div id="attachment_2305" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/05/SSG.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2305" class="size-medium wp-image-2305" alt="" src="http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/05/SSG-300x224.jpg" width="300" height="224" srcset="http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/05/SSG-300x224.jpg 300w, http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/05/SSG.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2305" class="wp-caption-text">St. Stephen&#8217;s Green on my last day. I&#8217;ll miss this view!</p></div>
<p><strong>2. FOODFOODFOODFOOD&#8230;YUM</strong></p>
<p>I will, and more importantly my stomach, will miss all of these places for their food and friendly environment!Â KC Peaches, Queen of Tarts, Bewley&#8217;s, Butlers, Fagan&#8217;s, Munchies: Honest to Goodness.</p>
<p><strong>3. The Sounds of Dublin</strong></p>
<p>Nothing beats walking down Grafton Street and hearing live music coming from every direction. My favorite band found on the streets was Keywest. It didn&#8217;t matter if I was busy and in a rush I always stopped when I heard them playing. I even bought their CD!</p>
<div id="attachment_2306" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/05/KEYWEST.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2306" class="size-medium wp-image-2306" alt="" src="http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/05/KEYWEST-300x224.jpg" width="300" height="224" srcset="http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/05/KEYWEST-300x224.jpg 300w, http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/05/KEYWEST.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2306" class="wp-caption-text">Keywest playing my favorite song, &#8220;On This Train&#8221; on Grafton Street!</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I loved abroad. In short, I loved hearing live music on Grafton Street, cookie hot chocolates from Butlers on rainy days, traveling on the weekends and eating chicken salsa melts from Munchies: Honest to Goodness. I have grown to love Dublin, Ireland but it&#8217;s time to head home to Muhlenberg. Thank a mil to everyone that made my abroad experience so incredible. I&#8217;ll never forget you Dublin. I hope to see you again real soon!</p>
