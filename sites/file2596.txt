					<description><![CDATA[Interesting article here, Group 4.  Can you be specific about which station WMBC is in New York?  Is it an independent station or one that is affiliated with one of the big networks?  [Ah, just looked it up and it is an independent station from Newton, New Jersey]  So, here is an example of a local exhibitor that is not affiliated with a major network attempting to counter-program the news during the standard 5pm news hour with soft news (the type you might see on a morning program like Today or Good Morning America, for example).  As you note, it&#039;s a case in which the product is being tweaked in order to appeal to a specific demographic.  This could be followed up in the presentation or in the paper with a look at how smaller, independent TV stations are doing in comparison to the larger, network-affiliated stations.  Just some ideas here....See if you can integrate power roles in your analysis, since it will help you to understand what specific aspect of the industry you&#039;re focusing on!]]></description>
