								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During this process, one of the new terms I learned about was the term misogynoir as it was used in one of our interviews. The term refers to misogyny specifically against Black women, and usually refers to to misogyny against Black women at the hands of Black men. When talking about misogyny it is always important to acknowledge intersectionality, and take into account that not all women experience misogyny in the same way. There are a few Black women who were interviewed that talked about straight Black men on campus having a general disinterest in Black women and preferring white women over them. This is definitely an issue that is seen not only on Muhlenberg’s campus, but also through our country. Eurocentric ideals of beauty affect us in so many ways. I have seen this in the queer male community as well and this is something that has bothered me personally, and something I have seen in several interviews as well. Racial preferences are racist. You can’t say you’re not attracted to a certain race without being racist because then you’re assuming that all people of that race essentially look that same and that there’s not even a remote possibility that you could be attracted to someone of that race. So, freshmen, please keep an open mind.</span></p>
