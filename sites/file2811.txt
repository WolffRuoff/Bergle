<p>Albiniak.P.(2011,February 14). Spencer, Levy to Head MTV&#8217;s Scripted Development.<em>Broadcasting &amp; Cable</em>. Retrieved from <a href="http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/463937-Spencer_Levy_to_Head_MTV_s_Scripted_Development.php" target="_blank">http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/463937-Spencer_Levy_to_Head_MTV_s_Scripted_Development.php</a></p>
<p>MTV’s scripted series recently appointed new leadership. The Network’s president or Programming David Janollari named Clay Spencer and Justin Levy the new heads. Janollari said that their combined experience makes them the perfect team to work together. Levy has worked on MTV scripted series before while Spencer is new to the network. Spencer’s diverse television career has had a successful track record; working on networks like The WB and an independent production company. Janollari and him have worked together before. Just like in the publishing world MTV is sticking to who has been successful. In demanding times for television it would not be wise to hire some brand new writer no one has heard of even if he or she looks to have good work. Janollari is hiring who he knows and who he thinks he can get good results from.</p>

<p>With MTV’s recent scandal in regards to their highly controversial series <em>Skins</em>, maybe it was time to get new management in the scripted sector of this network. Levy has already proven successful during his previous time and an MTV executive where he “spearheaded such scripted efforts as <em>The Hard Times of RJ Berger, Teen Wolf</em>, and <em>This is Awkward.” </em>Prior to MTV Levy worked as a director of NBC’s primetime series development. Working for NBC is a good credential to have under your belt and MTV recognized that.By filling the creator power role of their organization with an experienced writer, they not only help create a better product, but at the same allocate more power to Levy than they would with a lesser known producer.With the network’s new leaders for their scripted series maybe MTV’s scripted shows will be able to beat out the great rating of their reality shows like <em>Jersey Shore</em> for example. The power of using what you already know to be good cannot be underestimated.</p>
