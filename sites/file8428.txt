								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Internet has arguably become the most powerful thing known to mankind. It is one of the most popular and most widely used things by humans.  It has the ability to connect people worldwide literally making the world a smaller place. Online, you have the choice to be well known or anonymous, funny or serious, even evil or good hearted. The power of the Internet is unlimited and continues to grow every day. One of the scariest aspects of the Internet however is the fact that everybody has the ability to be anonymous. Anonymity is a very complicated thing, especially when it is applied on the Internet. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The video I watched was a TED Talk titled, </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Christopher &#8220;moot&#8221; Poole&#8221;: The case for anonymity online. Christopher Poole is famous for founding the anonymous imageboard website 4chan in which users can post anonymously on any topic they wish. It is famous for many memes including lolcats and rickroll. It is also notoriously known for many of the bad things the Internet has to offer. Interestingly enough, Poole did not really talk about the bad things that 4chan causes like the threats and the degradation of certain people. The closest thing he comes to talking about the bad side of 4chan are the rules, Poole says</span><span style="font-weight: 400">, “So does a site like this have rules? We do; they&#8217;re the codified rules that I&#8217;ve come up with, which are more-or-less ignored by the community.” This seems like an excuse that Poole is making. He is trying to explain that the fact that 4chan has a very negative connotation attached to it is not his fault. He even says, “The content is not dinner table conversation in the least.” This just shows how most of the content of 4chan is not of quality. I believe this is due to the fact that it is an anonymous site. I bet if 4chan required a username or picture that would eliminate the anonymity aspect of 4chan, the site would be very different from what it is like now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anonymity is also a very dangerous thing on the Internet because many people think that since they are anonymous they can do whatever they want. This is not the case, Poole says, </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And last, I&#8217;m going to show you the example, the story of Dusty the cat. Dusty is the name that we&#8217;ve given to this cat. This young man posted a video of him abusing his cat on YouTube. And, you know, this didn&#8217;t sit well with people, and so there was this outpouring of support for people to do something about this. So what they did is they &#8212; I mean, they put CSI to shame here &#8212; the Internet detectives came out.They matched, they found his MySpace. They took the YouTube video and they mashed everything in the video. Within 24 hours, they had his name, and within 48 hours, he was arrested.”</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This just shows how no matter what you do online and no matter how anonymous it is you might end up getting caught for something bad that you did. You always have to be aware of the consequences of every action, even online.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Overall, the Internet is anonymous whether we like it or not. I believe that you can have a great time on the Internet as long as you are safe. Since the Internet is anonymous you can have no idea who is who online therefore it is important to act just the way you would in real life. Sites like 4chan encourage bad behavior because of the anonymity aspect if it. One of the most important aspects of the internet that more people should follow is to be more aware of how they are behaving online.</span></p>
