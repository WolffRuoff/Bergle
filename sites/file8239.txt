								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“You have to see it to believe it.” Those were the words of a young student referring to the new learning methods used in his classroom. (Google for Education, 2015) In the 21<sup>st</sup> century, it has become incredibly unrealistic when teaching students about the variety of places around the world. However, this is coming to an end. What if you could see anywhere in the world all through a single lens? With Google Cardboard and the company’s new Expeditions program, this has been made possible. Today’s society is in the midst of excessive technological growth and change. Things are being done now that were never imaginable back in the day. Google’s Expeditions Pioneer Program brings class lessons to life. It offers an enriched experience that’s more interactive by letting students enter a world beyond their imagination by putting the globe right before their eyes. Learning has become that much easier.</p>
<p>Many believe it’s hard to learn the true meaning of a place without visiting it in person. Luckily for them, this is all about to change. Just a few years ago, Google unveiled a virtual reality headset known as Google Cardboard. And now it’s taking that one step further. Google’s Expeditions program lets you go places that were never thought conceivable. The program has already reached classrooms in the United States, United Kingdom, Brazil and Australia with many to come. But what’s so great about it? All for an exceptionally low cost, anyone can travel the world through a single lens. It’s quite remarkable.</p>
<p>With Cardboard, Google reinvented virtual reality. While textbooks are a great source for information, they’re sometimes hard to get and not everyone can afford them. Taking the subject Geography for example, while textbooks can show you a bevy of images taken from various places and wonders of the world, they don’t supply a full experience. This has left many wanting something more. According to (Google for Education, 2015), one of Expedition’s major strengths consists of just about anyone being able see the world through a lens in three-hundred and sixty degrees. Students can now walk through the jungle, visit the Great Wall of China, climb through the mountains, and even dive into the deep blue ocean. Many agree that this is the future of education and are shaken by how far technology has come. This relates to our class discussions at the beginning of the semester regarding recent technological growth. The experience is like no other. It’s believed by many that student takeaways will be much larger than one’s gains from just reading. Teachers believe it’s essential that students are able to see what they’re actually learning about in order to learn it properly.</p>
<p>An Expedition can best be described as a guided tour in which schools and buses aren’t capable of. While the list of places is quite vast already, it’s always growing to capture the world. Using Cardboard virtual reality headsets, students can physically walk around on the moon or fly over the Rocky Mountains just by tilting their head and pointing towards a certain direction. During the session, teachers can point out highlights while discussing their class notes at the same time. Many have come to the conclusion that this immerse experience makes learning more fun, interactive and thrilling, which can be seen in the video (Google for Education, 2015) during the student’s reactions. The headset is composed of nearly all cardboard keeping the price down, and thus allowing students all around the world to gain access to it.</p>
<p>Can you imagine sitting in class and visiting some the world’s greatest monuments without ever leaving the room? Now students can live this dream. The journey of Expeditions has just begun. Students worldwide can now see what it’s like in another continent or biome without the need to travel there. With the development of this product along with many others, it has become clear that technology has grown to a point where many can’t even believe the outcomes. There’s so much out there to see in such a small life span, and this device helps us conquer the world at our own convenience. Relating back to the common theme, it’s these experiences that will allow students to thrive in their academics, further enhance their education and develop a better understanding of the world around them. Who knows where it will take us next.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Technology has taken a turn. Teachers and students are within a period of enlightenment and change. The educational curriculum and methods to learning are undergoing a new approach, but are yet to be fully adopted. The current stage of innovation and advancement lies between two ages, the old and the new. The direction we’re headed for is far from where we started but at the same time, nowhere near the finish. People are being forced into making changes to keep pace with the everlastingly growth of society. Some in which we don&#8217;t even question and just move on. Educators are in the midst of many technological innovations and to keep up with the leap, it has become imperative to match these alterations promptly.</p>
<p>Many educators are aware of the movement and are trying to find the perfect balance. According to Jacobs (2010, p. 7), many are asking themselves “what is it we want students to know and be able to do?” What’s the primary goal? And the answer is, change the way we do things to benefit society. In chapter one, Jacobs (2010, p. 8) stated, be more deliberate and develop better ways of learning and thinking. In other words, to spring new ideas, make life swifter and ultimately improve generations to come. But why now you may ask. Currently, society sits in a period full of technological advancements which are strengthening the ways to better ourselves. This relates to our class discussion on technological growth.</p>
<p>School is a place where students challenge themselves and try to reach their targets. But the traditional way of educating students is far from the standard set back in the late 1800’s. From ink to pencils and from papyrus to paper, to the development of e-books, computers and now tablets, curriculum and the methods in which many learn has drastically changed. According to Jacobs (2010, p. 9), it’s evolving now more than ever. Schools around the world continue taking notice and are integrating these changes into their learning process. But there is still a vast majority of schools who have not implemented these advancements yet. For example, laws and privacy, as discussed in class, has kept some away from this movement. In addition, high costs and area/region along with a slew of other factors have kept adoption rate to a minimalist.</p>
<p>In chapter one, Jacobs (2010, p. 9) stated, “the concept of what school is does not need reform-it needs new forms.” This citation further exemplifies the educational technological movement and is essential to the common theme of this essay. But why? It&#8217;s not what we&#8217;re learning that needs to be revised, it&#8217;s the method in which we learn. With all this new technology, there&#8217;s work that can be done to make students better off. Such as using new programs, shifting from written assignments to online, reducing printing and having a more interactive learning experience. Many nowadays find these methods more interesting than the standard methods of learning. The reason this movement continues on is because many find education as a key importance in society. Although some disagree, the vast majority agrees this is the right thing to do in that these progressions will better prepare students for their future, which will in due course, impact the wealth of society.</p>
<p>Education is a major area of focus. The recent increase of technological advancements has directly led to a substantial increase in ways to better off curriculum. Society is progressing fast, but not until it has fully adopted the changes will a difference be made visible. New developmental hardware and software have made it easier to learn in a variety of ways. Online programs offer more hands on experience, ease of use and an increased amount of ways that one can learn interactively. Many agree that these new methods will allow students to further engage with their studies, comprehend information more easily, and create a new way of thinking and interpreting information. But the list doesn’t stop there. With this direction in toe and progressions in full swing, it’s a great time to make a change.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Technology has come a long way. The learning process that we all once knew has developed into a full virtual experience in such little time. If you hated interpreting those geographic maps in your textbook, you’re going love what the future holds. With the creation of Google Earth, Google put education first and foremost in its aims to bring learning to the next stage. Google Earth lets people carry out a countless number of actions unlike all ways before it. Each bringing a slew of benefits. One example allows people to look back on and notice cultural changes. While this is good for many, it’s especially good for scientists and historians who can further observe and analyze research using findings provided on the new platform. Another gives students visions of places they have learned about but are unable to travel to. So What? Being able to see the world in a lens, right in front of you allows people to see things that may no longer exist. Thus making it history. It can also help solve problems as to why an incident may have occurred in an easy and interactive way. Many have found Google Earth to be intruding and have already begun using the new technology in their life. Whether that be for their own use, in the office or on the go. Technology has come so far already, but many are predicting this is just the start.</p>
<p>Education is a big part in society and Google Earth has taken learning to the next level. A better education can mean a lot. Buy why? Ultimately it makes the next generation smarter. Which then sets the bar even higher for the next generation. Thus ensuring technology’s expansion. Google Earth has contributed highly to the understanding of recent history and the exploration of other countries. Prior to Google Earth, the methods of learning geography were not on par. Nowadays, being able to virtually navigate and see all angles and not just photos supply’s countless benefits to one’s overall learning experience. According to (Williams and Davinroy, 2015), “when students see for themselves the relationships between location, culture, and events, they become more engaged with the material we present.” This line is significant because it perfectly summarizes what Google Earth is all about. Throughout the article the idea that students absorb more knowledge using this method of learning is repeatedly addressed. Many find this concept interesting and agree, however, there are still a select bunch that prefer old style learning. According to (Williams and Davinroy, 2015), learning Earth Science has become a totally new experience, in addition, understanding Geography, history and even language classes have been impacted.</p>
<p>While Education is important, Google Earth can also strengthen one’s interpreting skills. Two of the most important ones being observing and analyzing. By constantly browsing on Google Earth, one is contextually observing what’s on screen and furthering their analyzing skills by making interpretations of the place in which they’re viewing. According to (Williams and Davinroy, 2015), with Google Earth at one’s side, students are more motivated to go explore the world, even when it’s not for a mandatory assignment. They’re also more likely to retain the information from the course because absorbing information from visuals has been proven easier than that of books. So what? The more locations and geographical features someone is exposed to, the larger the odds he/she will relate what they saw to something in the future. Ultimately, it has the power to broaden one’s mind with a variety of places around the world, solve mysteries, and even expand upon one’s skills thus lasting a life time.</p>
<p>Google Earth is giving people the chance to virtually discover the world through a single application. It’s teaching people long-lasting skills such as observation and analyzation, in addition to improving education in many different ways. The useful tools we have now that weren’t possible in the past are becoming successively better than the generation before. Google Earth opens up many opportunities by letting us explore any place whenever we want at a glance. As discussed in class, it amazes many to see the world’s growth in technology and it’s making for a better and enhanced future.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="mceItemHidden">Technology and smart devices are coming to new places in a variety of forms. Moving forward, technology is increasingly becoming a part of our daily lives. More than we even know it. But what does this mean for our generation? The goal is simple. To better the lives of many, keep everyone connected and make lives hassle free. But the transformation is easier said than done. Education is among one of the biggest undergoing changes. Current students have more ways than ever to explore new ideas and solve problems. And the growth is not coming to an end any time soon.</span></p>
<p><span class="mceItemHidden">The world is moving at a rapid pace and it’s directly led by recent technological innovations. Some of the most significant improvements are those taking place inside the classroom. Most say Technology’s integration with education enhances a student’s learning experience. However, <span class="hiddenSpellError">unrelatedly</span>, many see it as overwhelming, more time-consuming and difficult to make the change. However, this can’t be agreed to by everyone. New programs are allowing students to complete assignments entirely on their wireless devices without the need to pick up a pencil. Many find this very intriguing. New sharing options let students send off their assignments to teachers with ease. In addition, technology helps students stay in contact over weekends and school breaks.</span></p>
<p><span class="mceItemHidden">Another major strength of technology in the classroom is research, which has become easier than ever. The wide range of sources available right at one’s fingertips <span class="hiddenSuggestion">provide</span> students with speed and accuracy. Many agree, however, there is also a large <span class="hiddenSuggestion">selection</span> of garbage and irrelevant inaccurate information and people need <span class="hiddenGrammarError">to be</span> aware of. Throughout the encyclopedia article, the idea that mobile learning is controversial repeatedly comes up. But why? While technology in the classroom may seem useful to the <span class="hiddenSuggestion">majority</span>, many see it as distracting. Others say it’s even more time-consuming than standard learning and can cause stress due to common system errors making productivity a challenge. Additionally, many see it as unreliable and <span class="hiddenGrammarError">an invasion of</span> privacy. Being a student myself, it’s sometimes hard to disagree. According to (&#8220;Technology integration,&#8221; 2015), another concern <span class="hiddenGrammarError">is cost</span>. With all that one gets with access to a mobile device, it can become costly when having to <span class="hiddenSuggestion">provide</span> devices for a whole class. It’s believed by many that technology for the classroom is a work in progress that’s constantly growing and expanding.</span></p>
<p><span class="mceItemHidden">One key benefit of technology’s integration in the classroom is interactive learning. According to (&#8220;Technology integration,&#8221; 2015), the thought process and conceptual experience makes for an easier learning process. But why? By learning from one’s mistakes, students can make changes, review and perfect assignments and thus learn by doing. So what? This method has been proven <span class="hiddenGrammarError">to be</span> one of the best ways for the brain to absorb information.</span></p>
<p><span class="mceItemHidden">Being able to work on projects simultaneously with one another submit to the teacher for review all though a handheld device is something people in the past have only dreamed about. This relates to the class reading on how technology has evolved over time. According to (&#8220;Technology integration,&#8221; 2015), a project-based activity can enhance one’s ability to work in groups and solve more complex problems that one couldn’t normally complete on their own. In addition, interactive learning can also be fun and enjoyable. So What? This keeps the mind flowing and ultimately keeps students focused for longer periods at a time. This <span class="hiddenGrammarError">can be</span> very noticeable. As a result of recent technological advancements, it’s clear that collaboration plays a major role in the learning process. </span></p>
<p><span class="mceItemHidden">Technology in the classroom has come a long way. With <span class="hiddenGrammarError">the addition of</span> new programs and services, the methods to learning have changed drastically. Despite high costs, privacy issues, distractions, and often less reliability, technology in the classroom is becoming increasingly common throughout school districts around the globe. In relation to class discussions, many agree that technology is always growing and the only thing that stands in the way of adoption is time and effort. <span class="hiddenSpellError">Infographics</span> in recent class assignments have shown us the numbers <span class="hiddenSuggestion">pertaining to</span> the increasing adoption of digital media. Major brands are hard at work attempting to bring the latest and greatest to everyone so that lives <span class="hiddenGrammarError">will</span> be made easier and education <span class="hiddenGrammarError">can be</span> improved for all. </span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the release of the tool “Signal,” social media tech giant Facebook looks to help journalists discover new and spreading content. With the use of social media on the rise, inefficiency comes with it. While sites such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram sit back and enjoy all that’s taking place, social media followers may begin to feel a sense of overcrowding. Posts, happenings, and pictures are just some of the things that typically flood our newsfeeds. But is it all meaningful? Numerous analysts have observed that skipping around and scrolling through feeds trying to find the right post is becoming more common. So what? It’s extremely time consuming and news organizations aren’t receiving the credit they deserve. It has become a hunt and find for many and with all the new ways to share, it can become a bit overwhelming to lots. Facebook wants to change this.</p>
<p>In addition to communicating and sharing with friends, many see Facebook as a place to keep up on current news topics. According to Greenberg, (2015, p. 1) Signal offers a dashboard where journalists can follow trending and emerging topics, track chatter around public figures on a leaderboard, and search to find public conversations, photos, or videos. All in one place. One may be wondering where users seek new stories. Facebook made it clear that users can source articles via hashtags from anywhere on its social media site. I strongly believe that this will benefit both, Facebook users in addition to journalists. When I found out the feature was arriving now, I was blown away.</p>
<p>Facebook has been working endlessly to further lift their strengths and improve upon their weaknesses. Most of them being related to journalists. Just this past week, Facebook gave journalists the permission to live broadcast video using the company’s Mention application. This enhancement takes it not only a step forward, but an entire leap in the right direction. I strongly believe companies such as Facebook who are constantly working to improve and always rolling out updates deserve their place in the market. After reading some of Facebook’s stats in class along with other social media engines, it’s clear that Facebook is on par with competitors and its growth in the past few years have left me in disbelief. This just further exemplifies how much technology is expanding.</p>
<p>The following line is essential to the overall meaning of the article. “Signal is more than just another way for journalists to use Facebook. It’s a way for Facebook to show off the value of Facebook.” (Greenberg, 2015) But, why is this important? This statement sums up Facebook’s goal. Greenberg was absolutely right and makes a valid claim. Signal brings a whole new experience to both Facebook users and journalists. It will increase the value of published articles, make them easier to find, and help journalists predict upcoming trends as well as hot new topics. After all, news is an essential piece of the experience that comes on Facebook. I believe this will fill lots of hopes and further establish who Facebook really is and why they set out to exist. Not only will it help Facebook and news organizations provide relevant topics to millions of users, but it will push the limits of the industry to do the same. And that’s what keeps the world moving forward.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The benefits of reading are endless. It’s like trying to count the stars in the sky on a summer night. I’ll start with what’s most vital. Empathy. The ability to comprehend and share the feelings of an individual. According to Hanski (2014, p. 2), one positive impact of reading includes “Cultivating a so-called theory of mind, when one reads thoughts and feelings of people.” As meaningless as that may sound, the facts are there.</p>
<p>It’s proven that reading can better assist one to put him/herself in the position of another. Which ultimately, improves learning and being able to understand where one is coming from. But how? Your brain becomes accustomed to real situations. Understanding how someone feels is a great quality to have. It makes it easier to give advice, solve problems or simply just work it out. For example, every day can’t be a good one for everyone. Our body language and how we express ourselves are key signs to finding out someone’s mood. A lot of the time one doesn’t feel obligated to help that person and casually moves on with their day without trying to help. The more I see this ignorance happen, the more I feel I should step in and help. I hate being selfish and I dislike others who are selfish. The bottom line is that reading can help one another understand each other’s problems. So what? Without this important quality, nobody would be able to develop close bonds and more people would feel left out or lonely. Therefore, reading has the power make the world a better place.</p>
<p>Interestingly, recent studies have found that people who read excessively understand the world more. In the article, Hanski (2014, p. 2) states, “Books can infinitely expand your general view of this world.” This got me thinking. Could you imagine what the world be like if there was no method of communicating? People wouldn’t be raised, learn where they came from or develop friendships with one another. Life would be one big mystery.</p>
<p>Any sort of reading helps the mind. In the article, Hanski (2014, p. 2) revealed that reading lots in one’s early days could make one live longer. This is interesting because one doesn’t normally see reading as a way of staying healthy. It turns out reading plays a major role in keeping the brain active. It does so by continuously interpreting and evaluating. This struck me as ironic because most medications made to stabilize one’s health costs large sums of money, and reading is free and nearly everyone can be entertained by picking up a book.</p>
<p>Although many presume writing can be improved by learning different techniques and fixing a few grammar tweaks, the truth begs otherwise. Everyone’s writing tells a different story. Each and every person has been through diverse experiences that differentiate one from another. Consequently everyone conveys information in a way that feels natural to them. But one thing is for sure. Writing always has room to grow. Hanski (2014, p. 1) repeatedly brings up the idea of how reading can improve your writing thereafter. For example, Hanski (2014, p. 2) wrote the phrase “to learn more, keep reading.” I believe the message here is clear that every time we read something, whether it be a lengthy book or a short statement, we as humans learn from it. Reading helps people adapt to changes, learn from our mistakes in addition to help our brain learn right from wrong. There’s nothing in this world that enables one’s mindset to grow, more than reading.</p>
<p>Depending on what stage you’re at in life, the benefit of reading varies. For some it may be an eye opener as to who they truly are. For another it may teach a life lesson or further develop your character. Others will notice reading helps boost their self-esteem and remove stress. And lastly, it may expand your knowledge on a particular subject or add to your vocabulary. Clearly, a little reading has the potential to go a long way. The way people adjust to these assistances make them who they are. Whether physical or psychological, reading will improve your state in ways you don’t even realize. It will pave an upward pathway for one’s life, open up new opportunities and enlighten you with inspiration you didn’t have before.</p>
