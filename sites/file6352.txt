<h1>Introduction</h1>



<h5>The RJ Fellows Senior Capstone Seminar and Symposium are the culminating experiences for senior RJ Fellows.   The seminar which is held in the fall semester is a student driven academic exploration related to the RJ themes of understanding and effecting change. leadership, and community engagement.  Facilitated by Dr. Niesenbaum, Director of the RJ Program, students in the seminar select a theme for the semester, provide relevant readings, and lead classroom discussions and activities.  Students then develop projects related to specific subtopics under the overarching theme for the year.  Projects typically are community based and are initiated in the fall semester continuing into the spring.  Normally, students present their findings from their project-based learning  at the RJ Fellows Senior Symposium held in early April.  Unfortunately, due to COVID-19, their group project work was cut short, and it was not possible to hold the symposium.  However, they were asked to produce materials related to their seminar and project within the context of these challenging times that confront us all.  Consistent with the spirit and commitment of the &#8220;RJ Culture&#8221;, these students rose to this challenge and their excellent work is presented below.  We hope that you share the passion that we all have had for this work, and that you are able to find meaning and relevance in it.  </h5>

<h1>Interconnection</h1>
<h5>The theme for this year&#8217;s seminar, <em>interconnection</em>, grew out of our discussion of the different ways in which we engage with community, and<a href="http://rjfellows.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2020/04/banyan-tree-symbol-interconnectedness.jpg"><img class="wp-image-1558 alignright" src="http://rjfellows.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2020/04/banyan-tree-symbol-interconnectedness-300x226.jpg" alt="" width="203" height="153" srcset="http://rjfellows.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2020/04/banyan-tree-symbol-interconnectedness-300x226.jpg 300w, http://rjfellows.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2020/04/banyan-tree-symbol-interconnectedness.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 203px) 100vw, 203px" /></a> the realization that there is a great deal of interconnection among the different issues and stakeholders with which we engage.  During the seminar we read articles about interconnection that ranged from the Buddhist perspectives to the intersectionality of justice issues.  We explored the idea with regard to our notions of  nature, success, community, education, the arts, and technology and social media.  We came to the conclusion that change is best achieved when we recognize these interconnections and then strengthen and empower them. We realized that we are never alone, and that positive change radiates from the individual up through communities and beyond where we work together and our interests and passions intersect.  </h5>
<h5><a href="http://rjfellows.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2020/04/interconnectedness.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-1556 aligncenter" src="http://rjfellows.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2020/04/interconnectedness-300x251.jpg" alt="" width="230" height="192" srcset="http://rjfellows.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2020/04/interconnectedness-300x251.jpg 300w, http://rjfellows.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2020/04/interconnectedness.jpg 386w" sizes="(max-width: 230px) 100vw, 230px" /></a></h5>
<h5>What we did not realize in the fall was how the evolution of a novel virus and its subsequent spread would show us how interconnected we really are on a global scale.  This pandemic has wreaked havoc on our ways of life, our ability to complete our projects, and has become a source of stress sadness and uncertainty for each of us.  We watched it spread across the globe leaving death and economic loss in its path.  We made great efforts to protect those with whom we knowingly or unknowingly might connect.  As we were forced to distance ourselves from others the notion of interconnection became even clearer both as a potential danger, and something we crave and dearly miss.</h5>
<h5>Although the community-based projects we undertook were halted by this crisis.  We continued to think about our work, what might have been if we had been able to continue, and the lessons we learned.  Below you can view presentations and videos on our 3 project areas:</h5>
<ol>
<li>
<h4>Interconnection through interfaith communities;</h4>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Interconnection and the arts; and</h4>
</li>
<li>
<h4 style="text-align: left">Interconnection through citizenship.                                                                                              </h4>
</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>



<h5>We are saddened by the abrupt disruptions of our senior experience, and our ability to complete and present our final projects,  However, we are grateful for what we have learned together, and how we might apply those lessons towards meaningful change in ourselves, our communities, and the in this drastically different world in which we now live.</h5>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One way or another, change has always been a prominent factor in my life. It has been a great motivator for me; I have always been driven by the idea of effecting change in many respective communities. From participating Make-a-Wish triathlons at the age of seven to creating a non-profit and running a food pantry at the age of sixteen, I have always prided myself in bettering the lives of other people.  Interestingly, however, I have always resisted personal change, even when it was for the better. As a child of divorced parents, I have lived in eight different places with my Dad; I despised leaving each house more and more with each move. I despised leaving fifth grade to go to middle school, eighth grade to go to high school, and then even high school to go to college (despite the incredible things I had heard about Muhlenberg!). I never wanted to give away my toys or clothes as a kid, never wanted to paint my room, and even begged to keep our Christmas tree one year.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1507" style="width: 281px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://rjfellows.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2020/04/ryan1-1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1507" class="wp-image-1507 size-medium" src="http://rjfellows.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2020/04/ryan1-1-271x300.jpg" alt="" width="271" height="300" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-1507" class="wp-caption-text">With Stephanie Ng</p></div></p>
<p>I was always content with what I had and how I was &#8212; I resisted any change to that. As a result of seeing people who were not as content and fortunate as I was, I was always eager to effect change for them. I could not, however, accept change in my own life.  This changed when I arrived at Muhlenberg. I immediately became friends with Stephanie Ng and Riley Minkoff through the RJ Fellows First Year Seminar. Interacting with them inside and outside of the classroom revealed how motivated they were to not only effect change in their communities, but also to change themselves. They were passionate about finding ways to better themselves, even approaches that had worked for them before.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1508" style="width: 267px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://rjfellows.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2020/04/ryan2-1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1508" class="wp-image-1508 " src="http://rjfellows.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2020/04/ryan2-1-269x300.jpg" alt="" width="257" height="287" srcset="http://rjfellows.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2020/04/ryan2-1-269x300.jpg 269w, http://rjfellows.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2020/04/ryan2-1.jpg 362w" sizes="(max-width: 257px) 100vw, 257px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-1508" class="wp-caption-text">with Riley Minkoff</p></div></p>
<p>Stephanie and Riley did well in high school, as made evident by their awards and achievements. They, however, were often thinking about ways in which they could improve their study habits to maximize efficacy and effectiveness. “Why” I would ask myself, “are they doing this?!” “They are already good students!” I would say. They became even better. They set goals and expectations for themselves that were elevated from high school. As they met these, new goals and expectations were set. And the successes came and came and came (look at where they are and where they are going!). I was able to model my own habits after theirs, changing my old process of procrastinate-until-the-last-minute that I had done my whole life. I not only saw success, but was also able to enjoy the process.</p>
<p>Riley and Stephanie involved themselves with many things on campus &#8212; as did I &#8212; and with each year the three of us had more and more opportunities tointeract through extracurricular activities. As these opportunities came, particularly in the first two years, I would always say yes, until the point where I was spread so thinly that I barely had time for anything. I would ask Riley and Stephanie about how they managed to accomplish all that they did while not feeling too overwhelmed, and I gleaned that the most important factor was passion; everything that they did was something for which they were incredibly passionate. From this I learned to let things go, even if at some point they had been one of my favorite activities, clubs or groups. I learned how to say no and to respect my own time and effort, which was something I had been unable to do prior to college. I began to partake solely in things which were exciting for me. I was able to dedicate myself more to my academics, to football, to the Writing Center and to the office of admissions.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg Football provided me with a few large opportunities to change. Since my first year of playing football at age 10, I was always the quarterback. I got used to and comfortable in the spotlight. Unfortunately, prior to arriving at Muhlenberg I suffered an elbow injury that derailed my Quarterbacking career. I decided, rather than quitting, to change positions, which I would end up doing 3 more times. I ended up at Wide Receiver, a position which I played for over two seasons. But I never started a single game. I had always been the star, and now it was like I wasn’t even there. I was frustrated and enraged, both with my injury and with the coaching staff. “How does this happen to me? Why? What did I do wrong?” were questions that I asked myself. I stayed up at night, every night, wondering what went wrong. I was ashamed, embarrassed, confused and angry.</p>
<p>I then made the decision to change my outlook and change my role. I decided that not every kid can be the best on the team, that that just isn’t possible. Not every kid can start, that isn’t possible either. I also came to recognize that what I had to offer was energy and positivity, and that these could be used as an incredible tool for good. At the start of my junior year I began to radiate more positivity than I had ever before, and with it came leadership. People began to look up to me, not for the player that I was, but for the person that I was. I assumed a role of keeping spirits high and energy flowing, which I embraced more and more as time passed.</p>
<p>We had our two most successful years in program history, and my coach described me as being “the glue that held everyone together.” I wasn’t the Quarterback or the star player, but was overjoyed to be the glue.</p>
<p>Riley and Stephanie, if you read this, thank you for pushing me beyond what I envisioned or planned. I accomplished things and changed in ways that I didn&#8217;t think were possible, and I attribute that to you two, in addition to the many others who have helped me along the way. I am proud to be your friend because of how successful you two are going to be, and am grateful for how much better you made me, too. You two will be the glue no matter where life takes you.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I arrived at Muhlenberg on August 21st, 2016, my eyes were wide open and brimming with ideas on how to initiate change. An acceptance into the RJ Fellows program had already encouraged me. There </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">were</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> people in the world with the same vision, drive, and hope that I had, and we were all on a scholarship due to the initiative of our two beloved supporters, Rita &amp; Joe! Throughout the week of RJ Pre-Orientation, our activities included stepping into the Allentown community, cleaning up trash up and down the Lehigh River, and engaging in fellowship with one another. I was thrilled to be partnering with other change-makers, and I looked forward to the four years to come.  Nevertheless, I soon gained a thorough understanding of some dismal realities; change wasn’t as easy to come by as I had hoped. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">All the RJ Fellows took the first year seminar course together. This year, the course was titled: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">The Wire: Representing Inner City Life</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">. For our first class with our fellow revolutionaries, this course was unexpected. Rather than coming together to brainstorm ways to change our school’s attitude towards waste, cultures of exclusivity, or our carbon footprint, we came together to comprehend the deeply ingrained, institutional racism of our nation. Immersed in this heavy topic, we faced problems that likely wouldn’t be solved by our own hands. What could we do to reverse the unacknowledged, nationwide association between drugs and inner city black populations? How could our actions be of any consequence in opposition to the devastating effects of gerrymandering? I often walked out of Professor Mello’s classroom feeling defeated, unsure if I would be able to stand upright against the coursing tides of corrupted politics in the world. How could I, one person out of billions, make a lasting change?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite my cynical perspective towards revolutionary change, the years following my freshman year taught me how to approach change differently. I remember voicing a prayer sophomore year that would proceed to change my life: “Lord, let me find those who struggle with anxiety, depression, or other harmful tendencies, that I might love them well.” After one moment of prayer, I began to meet people left and right who would share their deep troubles and insecurities with me. While some shy away from traumatic issues, the swelling of tears, and a history of grief, I began to seek out opportunities to empathize with others, and I saw change everywhere. In my passion to bring mental health awareness to the stage, I created a dance work entitled, “Endlessly Engulfed,” based on the physical and psychological experience of social anxiety. Ironically, many of my dancers were under physical, mental, and emotional strain throughout the process, and I needed to constantly extend grace for tardiness/absences in order to allow them the space and love they needed to heal. Even though I sought to stir a wider audience towards empathy, I would have neglected my vision if I had brought a demanding, unempathetic presence into my work-space. Change does not begin on the global scale, it starts in the microcosm of personal relationships. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My drive to love others has prompted me to engage with those from different backgrounds than my own, especially in interfaith conversations. The play Lessons for an Unaccustomed Bride by José Rivera features two women with vastly different religious beliefs and cultural backgrounds. At first, they engage in explosive dialogue, yet their quarrel eventually evolves into mutual respect and understanding. As a devout Christian with an Orthodox Jew for a best friend, I immediately resonated with the challenges and resolutions of this work. Luckily, I was accepted into the cast, and I helped devise the ensemble’s melody and movement which fully embodied the interfaith relationship within the play. Furthermore, the artistic work of encouraging interfaith conversations moved me to develop a dance piece for my Senior Showcase, bringing various religious understandings to a primarily secular stage. In my four years at Muhlenberg, God has grown my heart for understanding others and widened my perspective of how that understanding can cross boundaries and affect</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">audiences. Nonetheless, I have also grown to realize that the path to change can also come through diligent, organized action.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Through the support of many around me, I was able to organize people and resources to witness change on a global scale, through an organization called Operation Christmas Child. The Student Government Organization (SGA) at Muhlenberg is generous towards clubs who need catering, supplies, or funding in other areas for various events. With this knowledge, I brainstormed different ways to allocate these resources towards something beyond Muhlenberg, to affect lives that really needed it. My inspiration was soon realized in a “packing party” with Operation Christmas Child. With funds from Chapel, Catholic Campus Ministries, DiscipleMakers Christian Fellowship, and SGA, we were able to buy supplies to fill </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">100 shoe boxes</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> with gifts for children who might not otherwise have received it! We collected letters from students all over campus, and we came together to fill the shoe boxes with letters, toys, toiletries, school supplies, scarves, etc for children across the globe. During the packing event, my dear friend Marie Grace Imanariyo spoke about her own experience, as her own life was once transformed through the generous gift of an Operation Christmas Child shoebox one Christmas. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My journey at Muhlenberg begins and ends in optimism. Although an individual cannot singlehandedly reverse the effects of institutionalized racism or halt escalating global atrocities, we </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">can</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> change the world, as long as we begin with a glance at our heart. My heart for others allowed me to empathize with those struggling with mental health, to appreciate others from different backgrounds, and seek ways to positively impact the audiences and children around me. If you have the desire to promote another’s well being, you also have the capacity to do it. No action is too insignificant to be considered an act of change. </span></p>

While the course offerings vary semester by semester, all RJ Fellows must complete between their FYS and Senior Capstone 4 courses with the RJ designation.  These are courses drawn from across the curriculum and many also fulfill general academic or major requirements. Ideally, the 4 courses represent each of the 4 academic divisions–Math and Sciences, Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences.  In selecting RJ courses, <em>no fewer than 3 of the academic divisions must be represented,</em> to foster breadth and understanding of multiple perspectives.  <strong>For first year RJs there has been a slight change in this requirement.</strong>  <strong>Please see my email or contact me if you have any questions.</strong></p>
<p>The following are courses offered in Spring 2020 that RJ Fellows can take towards fulfilling the requirements of the RJ Fellows program.  If a course listed here has multiple sections being offered as listed on Capstone, all sections apply.  Many of these courses also fulfill general academics or program requirements as indicated below.  <strong>Courses listed in the <a href="http://rjfellows.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/?page_id=554">Course Archives</a> have been reviewed and those that remain also count as RJ Fellows courses as describe above.</strong></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I knew that in college I was going to learn a lot, but I wasn’t ready for what I was going to learn from the RJ Fellows Program. One opportunity I didn’t realize that I was going to have was the engagement in dialogue on more difficult matters, such as poverty and social injustice.  From First Year Seminar, to the cluster and ultimately our senior capstone, I’ve had the<a href="http://rjfellows.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2020/04/IMG_4749-rotated.jpeg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1482 alignright" src="http://rjfellows.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2020/04/IMG_4749-225x300.jpeg" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="http://rjfellows.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2020/04/IMG_4749-225x300.jpeg 225w, http://rjfellows.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2020/04/IMG_4749-rotated.jpeg 240w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /></a>most wonderful and enriching discussions because of the fabulous group of individuals in my RJ cohort. We were taught the tools in class to challenge our own thoughts  which has ultimately led me to articulate them more effectively. We are able to have these incredible discussion because the RJ Fellows program is made up of individuals who are high achieving academically, and who have a passion for becoming leaders, creating change, and giving back to our communities. We, as a collective, have the perfect mix of traits and interests that allow us to bring our own personal experiences on leadership, change, and community service to help each other grow. When <strong>we</strong> have class discussions, <strong>we</strong> drive the robust conversations. We challenge each other’s questions, bounce off each other’s ideas, talk about a single concept in multiple contexts to really dissect and fully more explore the topics we’re talking about.</p>
<p>Beyond the opportunity for wonderful discussions, I’ve had the opportunity to continue developing my leadership and organizational skills as the social chair and program assistant for the RJ Fellows. As social chair, I was able to plan social gatherings, whether it be brunch at Nick’s diner or a treat night at the Udder bar, to help reinforce that sense of community among the entire program. There is strength in numbers, so it is really important for the individuals in the program to engage with each other and for the program to really have that sense of unity. By strengthening the relationships within the program, we are able to achieve the goals we all share when it comes to effecting change in our community. Other programming that I have organized for the RJs has included communicating community service events and promoting our program through social media. By doing so, I hope to encourage the members in the program to continue engaging in community service while publicizing the important work the RJs have done. This gives us the opportunity to support and recognize each other for the work we’re doing, but also let other people know what our honors program is really about.</p>

<p>I am so thankful for having the opportunity to be in the RJ Fellows program. I still remember initially being accepted into it and not knowing what it meant to be a part of this group. Now I’m able to reflect on my experience and see how it has truly shaped my time at Muhlenberg. I’ve met such great people because of this program and have grown so much as a person because of the opportunities this program has provided to me. I am so glad I can say I am an RJ Fellow.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am still not quite sure how we became seniors so quickly and time just seems to keep moving faster. It’s hard to believe that I now sit here reflecting on my college experience with the feeling that it went by in the blink of an eye. As many of us do, I still remember the first day of freshman year, the first day of the orientation program, the first day of the RJ pre-orientation program, and even the day I got my invitation to the RJ Fellows Program. It seems like just yesterday, and when I think about all that we have done in our years at Muhlenberg, it seems almost impossible. Yet, the RJ Fellows Program has been a constant in those memories through all four years and I will be forever grateful for this community.</p>

<p>I am currently participating in one of my favorite parts of the RJ program. Each spring, the senior class presents on an original advocacy and change program that they researched and implemented in our greater communities. These projects have been anything from education on current events, advocacy work for issues they find important or direct action in local communities. This project has always been so fascinating to me. We spend the three years leading up to this seminar learning about what it looks like to create change in different communities and the barriers that come with that change. This seminar allows us to put that knowledge into action. For three years, I could only guess what my class would decide to do but it has always been so intriguing to think we would have an opportunity to drive this class and this project from start to finish ourselves.</p>
<p>On the first day of class, we started to brainstorm key issues we think are important to explore. We have spent all of the class periods since diving deeper into aspects of this topic and how it relates to change in our greater Allentown communities. This part of the class has been completely student-driven and it has been so powerful to learn from our classmates in this way. It is uncommon in college to have entire classes led by our peers, but it is such a unique experience to participate in classes and discussions designed and led by classmates. It has been inspiring to see classmates take their own approaches to teaching and discussing with the rest of our class, focusing on what they find most important.</p>
<p>Every RJ comes to the program with a different background (based on geography, majors, extracurriculars, and many more). We spend the majority of our college experience focused on those parts of our lives, yet the RJ program has allowed us to come together and learn in a way that incorporates all of our different backgrounds. This has shown through in our discussions this semester. Everyone brings their own perspective to the table. It is fascinating to see the last three years of our classwork and experiences impact the way we think about issues in our communities.</p>
<p>In addition to the discussions we are having, our class is working to develop and implement the senior project for the local Allentown communities. This project has been such an important and immersive learning opportunity. We are thinking about everything from research, to outreach, to logistics, working together to make sure everything gets done. I have no doubt that we will be working in teams in one capacity or another after graduation, and the skills learned from working through a project start to finish like this are invaluable. We are going to be connecting with local communities in Allentown and I am looking forward to working with these different groups throughout the rest of the year.</p>
<p>I am continually inspired by the hardworking, dedicated and passionate people that make up the RJ program. It has been a pleasure to work with them and learn from them, both in our more structured seminar class and throughout our college experience. On the first day of our senior seminar, we spent the first 10 minutes just greeting each other again, and that was truly indicative of how close we are. While we all took different paths in college, it almost feels like we did it together, coming back at times to update each other and learn from each other in new ways. This has been a community that is there for each other no matter what. While I am not quite sure I will believe that we are graduating until we walk across the stage, I know I will always have this group to lean on long after our time at Muhlenberg</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://rjfellows.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2020/01/SXDH9655.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1472 alignleft" src="http://rjfellows.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2020/01/SXDH9655-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="http://rjfellows.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2020/01/SXDH9655-300x200.jpg 300w, http://rjfellows.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2020/01/SXDH9655-768x511.jpg 768w, http://rjfellows.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2020/01/SXDH9655-1024x682.jpg 1024w, http://rjfellows.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2020/01/SXDH9655-272x182.jpg 272w, http://rjfellows.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2020/01/SXDH9655.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>When people ask me the question “How did you choose Muhlenberg,” I have found myself replying that Muhlenberg chose me. As many other millennials have found, and are currently finding, the college application and acceptance process is an increasingly challenging and competitive one, often leaving students with the prospect of an entirely different future than expected. I certainly am one of those students. I had toured Muhlenberg during the summer: there weren’t many students on campus, aside from what I could now recognize as a summer theater program getting a lesson in fight choreography on the green. Needless to say, my picture of Muhlenberg and its student life was dim, and when, come the following year, I was to receive one of my only official college acceptances, I was faced with the uncomfortable situation of my decision having basically been made for me. I was going to Muhlenberg—that school with the giant red sculpture and a bunch of random people fencing on the lawn—because it was the only school that clearly chose me. It felt out of my hands. It felt like a leap of faith. I was scared.</p>
<p>A few weeks later, I received notice from the school that I had been accepted into a scholar’s program called the RJ Fellows. At first, I didn’t really know what it was, or even what to make of it: a group of scholars focused on how to create change in our communities. Sounded great, but what would that look like? Apart from taking classes together and the occasional group-bonding and volunteering event, how would this program live up to its goal? Even in my senior year, I am still asking these questions. But one thing I can say for sure is that the individuals in my RJ class of 2020 have been a source of inspiration (and friendship) for me throughout my time at Muhlenberg, and I can’t imagine change being achieved in any community without inspiration.</p>
<p>The liberal arts education allows for the wonder of discovery, the thrill of inspiration, by requiring student to hear different voices; to acknowledge and attempt to understand the different lenses through which people see the world, and to realize that the one you have is unique to you and colors your outlook in a certain shade. Therefore, to educate yourself liberally is to explore new “shades,” to nuance and add other colors to the perspective-lens which you call your own. Upon reflection, the RJ Fellows group is like the liberal arts on a micro scale: 12 students were brought together from a wide array of backgrounds and experiences, having entirely different interests and perspectives through which they see the world, yet were asked to participate in several RJ-designated courses together throughout our Muhlenberg career to apply those perspectives to a wide array of topics in need of critical discussion. And discuss we certainly did! From mass incarceration and inner-city life, to the portrayal of sex and gender in religion, and even wondering about our DNA: we talked and thought and thought some more. I can’t say we ever came to any concrete conclusions; except for the conclusion that we certainly don’t all agree. Yet we still have a deep respect and care for one another, which has in many ways been fostered by the time spent together as a group getting to know one another. But also, through inspiration. When you have the opportunity to notice and recognize the amazing gifts of the people surrounding you all the time, in class or in the community, when you are inspired by your peers, you feel hopeful and powerful to make change.</p>
<p>By sharing our unique perceptions, we not only inspire one another, but challenge ourselves to think critically of our own stance. We learn from one another; we also in turn question and doubt ourselves. Which I think is necessary if we want change. Change need not be large-scale; in fact, as I am learning right now in my religion class on Gandhi &amp; Non-Violence, Gandhi certainly argued that social and political change was fundamentally rooted in the change and betterment of the self. The change that he desired for his country and people was an independence of India that necessitated not just “Home Rule,” but “<em>self-rule</em>,” disciplining of your own person such that you are better adapted to serve society.</p>
<p>Change is of course happening all of the time, but we often don’t see it. Or, what we want to see, we’ll never be able to. Will I see a decrease in climate change in my life, or just an increase in droughts, forest fires, natural disasters, and peoples’ lives being torn apart? If I don’t see the change, did I do enough? Did I really help? My Muhlenberg experience has shown me that one of the best gifts we have to enact change is inspiring others, for that can in turn change them and cause a ripple effect. Inspiring others does not necessitate going out of your way to do things that many people will see, just for the sake of people seeing it; rather, I’d like to think that inspiring others necessitates a discipline of the self, to be who you are. Which doesn’t mean that who you are is unquestionable and static, that there isn’t room for change based on other people’s perspective “shades.” But I think there needs to be a certain trust or hope that at the end of the day, you have respect for yourself—acting unto others as you would wish them to act unto you—and respect that your world lens is a unique shade that is still interconnected with others’. Because what you may think to be a normal act or idea for you, could be incredibly inspiring to someone else; we never really know…but if we can continue to challenge ourselves to be inspired by one another, by surrounding ourselves with new voices and visions, then we are already on a path of change.</p>
<p>So, RJ class of 2020, this goes out to you: Riley, thank you for inspiring me with your tenacity for political science and your sharp, critical mind (and love for Beyoncé); Laura, thank you for inspiring me with your ability to ask questions and to be honest about hardships; Sophia, I am inspired by your creativity and the way you apply yourself to the programs that are meaningful to you; Anne, for your unrestrained affection and ability to show your love towards others, I am always inspired. Dani, I am inspired by your down-to-earth wisdom; Ryan, I am inspired by the way you are able to get along with anyone and for your welcoming and comfortable presence; Sara, you inspire me by your ability to listen to others, to make them feel heard and to lift them up in doing so; And Emily, I am inspired by your empathy and ability to feel and express your emotions.  Steph, you inspire me with your perseverance and dedication; Posie, I am inspired by your wit, composure, and eloquence; Kieva, your knowledge and advocacy for the voices and perspectives that are often silenced in our world, I find inspiring; And Kylee, you inspire me with your humble brilliance and contagious curiosity.</p>
<p><a href="http://rjfellows.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2020/01/IMG_7121.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1471" src="http://rjfellows.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2020/01/IMG_7121-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="http://rjfellows.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2020/01/IMG_7121-300x200.jpg 300w, http://rjfellows.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2020/01/IMG_7121-768x511.jpg 768w, http://rjfellows.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2020/01/IMG_7121-1024x682.jpg 1024w, http://rjfellows.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2020/01/IMG_7121-272x182.jpg 272w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>My Muhlenberg experience has been many things, but the RJ Fellows program has certainly played an important role in it. I am very grateful to be a part of it and to have met such inspiring people. As we prepare for graduation and what will come for each of us beyond Muhlenberg, I hope that we can all remember the power of cultivating and critiquing our own selves, such that we can be inspirations to others.</p>

I knew that this group of people was going to be community minded, but I did not know much else. In high school, I usually got close with people through community service or through theatre. Both community service and theatre are acts of giving, which connect the givers to the receivers and the givers to each other. And of course, this giver/receiver binary isn’t really a binary, and in both community service and theatre, who is giving to whom gets beautifully blurred throughout the experience. At the RJ Fellows pre-orientation, our experiences of giving to the community, such as bike riding while picking up trash, allowed us to connect pretty quickly through the shared enjoyment in this act of giving.</p>
<p>As we bonded with each other, we also connected with our new community of Allentown. <a href="https://richardniesenbaum.com/bio/">Dr. Niesenbaum</a> brought us to places of art, food, and culture around the city. I remember being warned about the problematic way some Muhlenberg students talk about Allentown, saying not to go past a certain street, saying it is unsafe. I was glad we were all warned about this, because I knew Allentown already, being from Bethlehem, and I knew it was a great place. This fear of certain sections of Allentown (that some Muhlenberg students seemed to have) has its roots in racist and classist thinking, and probably stems from a fear of the unknown. This RJ Fellows community not only prepared me for this potential conversation, but it also showed all of us right in the first week, how much Allentown could give us and how much we could engage with the Allentown in community.</p>
<p>In doing so, the program helped me feel grounded in not only the Muhlenberg community, but also the Allentown community. One example is my relationship with the <a href="https://www.bradburysullivancenter.org/">Bradbury-Sullivan LGBT Community Center</a>. I love to get their email blasts, and come in to volunteer when they need help on a project. I also started working at Sacred Heart Senior Living Center. While my relationships at Muhlenberg were irreplaceable and important, I am also so grateful I was able to extend outward and engage with members of the community who weren’t directly related to Muhlenberg.</p>
<p>Inspired by the RJ Fellows community mindset, over one of my summers at Muhlenberg, I interned at the United Nations with the <a href="http://Gray Panthers at the High Level Political Forum">Gray Panthers at the High Level Political Forum</a>. The internship was focused on the rights of older individuals around the world. This opportunity for advocacy work came my way, because I was inspired by the program as well as my peers within the program. The students who were both my peers and inspiration were always following their passions and their drive to lift others up where they could.<a href="http://rjfellows.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2020/01/kylee1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1467" src="http://rjfellows.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2020/01/kylee1-300x190.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="190" srcset="http://rjfellows.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2020/01/kylee1-300x190.jpg 300w, http://rjfellows.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2020/01/kylee1-768x486.jpg 768w, http://rjfellows.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2020/01/kylee1.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>So much of the spirit of the RJ Fellows is in engaging in conversation. Thinking back on my relationships within the Muhlenberg community, I see that the friendships I have made with the RJ Fellows and the support we found with each other is something special. The RJ Fellows program, through education and a community focus, fostered this friendship. Our first class together was our FYS, on the TV show The Wire, with <a href="https://www.muhlenberg.edu/academics/polisci/faculty/brianmello/">Brian Mello</a>. His class was exceptional; he lectured and encouraged discussion on issues of race, gender, and class, and gave us a shared vocabulary with which to discuss these issues. I’m sure we all remember those enlightening talks about hegemonic masculinity.</p>
<p>I can also give the RJ Fellows program credit for sparking my decision to become a Women’s and Gender Studies minor. One of our cluster courses was Sex Gender and Religion, and when looking for another class to take, Dr. Mello as my FYS advisor pointed me to a wonderful course called Gender, Politics, and Policy. These courses were amazing, and taking the cluster course with my RJ Fellows peers allowed my excitement over the material to brew through conversation.</p>
<p><a href="http://rjfellows.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2020/01/kylee3.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1468 alignleft" src="http://rjfellows.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2020/01/kylee3-300x226.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="226" srcset="http://rjfellows.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2020/01/kylee3-300x226.jpg 300w, http://rjfellows.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2020/01/kylee3-768x578.jpg 768w, http://rjfellows.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2020/01/kylee3.jpg 968w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>As for my major, I think Theatre is a subject that intertwines with my RJ Fellows minded interests. There is such beauty in the way theatre productions bring together a community of people, all working hard to put something together to give to the community. I have been so grateful to be able to be a part of the theatre productions at Muhlenberg, to be able to work with such generous, talented artists, and to be able to give some large piece of myself to the Muhlenberg and Allentown communities. Lately I have become more certain that I want to help more people gain access to theatre arts. The RJ Fellows program has helped me remember to always think deeply on inequalities that might go unnoticed to those with privilege. I have been extremely lucky to be able to be educated in theatre arts, and it has brought me great joy, and I want to work to make art for wider audiences, as well as working with children who do not have the money to afford theatre classes. The RJ Fellows I have grown to love are a bunch of clever, silly, driven, and warm people. I am so glad I have gotten to be their friends these past four years. I’ll miss them all dearly.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://rjfellows.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2020/01/KyleeinFlorence--e1579456372428.jpg"><img class="wp-image-1456 size-medium alignleft" src="http://rjfellows.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2020/01/KyleeinFlorence--e1579456372428-283x300.jpg" alt="" width="283" height="300" /></a>I had a rocky start to my time as an RJ, and to my college career in general. At 3:00am, the night before I was supposed to leave my home in Columbia, South Carolina and make the long drive to Allentown PA, I fell out of my loft bed. I don’t remember what happened, just waking up on the floor afterwards, and my parents leading me out to our living room. My best guess is that, half asleep from pre-college jitters, I tried to climb out of my bed while not fully awake. Instead of moving into my first college dorm room and starting the RJ Pre-Orientation Program, I spent the next week in the hospital, and underwent major surgery to repair the damage I had sustained to the ligaments in my shoulder. My doctor did not encourage me to leave for college right away. He suggested that I take a few weeks to heal and arrive late. I refused this option. My mother offered to get a hotel room in Allentown so she could take care of me and drive me back and forth to classes, I refused this too. I didn’t want to be later than I already was, and I didn’t want to stand out any more than I knew I would with my sling and giant scar. I was worried about arriving late, not only having missed all of Pre-O, but also the first day of regular orientation. Everything felt overwhelming, and I felt like I had missed those first hours where everyone is equally helpless. People had already attached themselves to someone for the weekend, how could they not? But, the other members of the RJ Fellows program included me from the moment I awkwardly walked into the middle of their FYS orientation meeting. A classmate, now dear friend, Kylee, recognized me from a theatre intensive we had done together while still in high school. Kylee was the single person I knew at Muhlenberg before move-in, and I had no idea she was an RJ. Just her presence in the room put me at ease, and made me feel more able to approach the other members of our group. Everyone was open, and immediately made me feel welcome, despite the fact that they didn’t know me at all yet.</p>
<p>The experience of starting college with my arm in a sling, and heavily medicated on pain pills was really the beginning of the intense growth period I have experienced at Muhlenberg. Coming from a home-schooled background, I had no experience in a classroom setting, let alone one where I was expected to voice my opinions out loud in front of my peers. Our RJ Fellows FYS taught me to be comfortable expressing myself in a class setting, and showed me how productive educational spaces can be when real curiosity is fostered.<br />
This RJ driven learning space continued in my sophomore year through the RJ Cluster. While I was slightly disappointed that my peers got to choose their own cluster courses, I was mostly excited, because I knew that these two classes would be filled not only with friends, but with students who cared as much as I did, who put in the work, and came to class ready to investigate the topics at hand. I take my best class notes during lively group discussions, when new ideas jump into the room every time a hand goes up. No matter how many discussion based classrooms I sit in at Muhlenberg, none are quite so alive as the RJ inhabited ones.</p>
<p>I chose a liberal arts college because I wanted to learn not only about Theatre, my major, I also wanted to know about the world. I knew that a broader understanding of the world would help me investigate life through art in a deeper way. It is clear to me, looking back on my college experience, that the RJ Fellows program is an amplification of the liberal arts ideal. Studying the liberal arts means dipping your toe into many pools, it means seeing the importance of things that are outside your major. The RJ program encourages you to push that thinking even further. Yes, explore subjects you’re unfamiliar with. Engage in classroom debates with equally invested peers. Be curious about everything. See the value in knowledge from all disciplines. Learn to apply them everywhere.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As I near the end of my four years at Muhlenberg College, it is difficult to imagine what my experiences would have been like without my constant connection to the RJ Fellows Program. When I arrived on campus early for the RJ Pre-Orientation, I was incredibly nervous. I was honestly a little sad that I had to go to school before most students, but the four day program ended up surprising me in a variety of ways. My class of RJ Fellows were the first people I met at college and became my very first Muhlenberg friends. We all hit it off much more easily than I anticipated thanks in large <a href="http://rjfellows.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2020/01/IMG_1851.jpg"><img class="wp-image-1450 size-medium alignleft" src="http://rjfellows.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2020/01/IMG_1851-e1578948580385-241x300.jpg" alt="" width="241" height="300" srcset="http://rjfellows.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2020/01/IMG_1851-e1578948580385-241x300.jpg 241w, http://rjfellows.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2020/01/IMG_1851-e1578948580385.jpg 358w" sizes="(max-width: 241px) 100vw, 241px" /></a>part to our leaders. The Pre-Orientation program is extremely special because it is student-led, so I immediately began to connect with students in class years above me. Being welcomed into the RJ program during these first few days, and the Muhlenberg community as a whole, assured me that I had chosen the right place to spend my next four years.</p>
<p>Pre-Orientation also showed me what I could expect from our program as a new RJ Fellow. Our honors community on campus is made up of students committed to creating change and viewing the world through an analytical and community-minded lens. My first few days at Muhlenberg with the RJs exemplified these values to me in real time. We completed service projects around the community of Allentown, such as a trash cleanup at a local stream, and we explored the vibrant downtown of the city as we discussed the effects of gentrification and what it means to create positive change for all. Beyond our service and change-oriented activities, we also focused on building our own community. The RJ program has taught me that the most powerful change is created from a group of people united by shared values and the integration of many individual ideas. These seeds were planted by my first few days of Pre-Orientation, as I got to know my classmates and we built a community of our own that would follow us throughout our time as Muhlenberg students.</p>
<p><a href="http://rjfellows.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2020/01/IMG_1850-e1578948725377.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1451 size-medium" src="http://rjfellows.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2020/01/IMG_1850-e1578948725377-300x223.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="223" srcset="http://rjfellows.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2020/01/IMG_1850-e1578948725377-300x223.jpg 300w, http://rjfellows.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2020/01/IMG_1850-e1578948725377-768x572.jpg 768w, http://rjfellows.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2020/01/IMG_1850-e1578948725377-1024x762.jpg 1024w, http://rjfellows.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2020/01/IMG_1850-e1578948725377.jpg 1116w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>When I look back on my first year at Muhlenberg and how many new experiences I was exposed to, I think of my RJ classmates as somewhat of an anchor for me — both socially and academically. After spending four days together uninterrupted before school officially began, it was such a comfort to come back to one another for our RJ-designated First Year Seminar. Our FYS, taught by Brian Mello in the Political Science department, focused on the TV show, <em>The Wire</em>, as a means of discussing issues linked to the inner-city of Baltimore (and beyond). That course remains one of the most impactful that I have taken at Muhlenberg. Having academic experiences with my RJ classmates shaped the community that we were building in a critical way, as we got to know one another as thinkers, creators, and students. Even after our FYS concluded and the full group of us wasn’t in class together every semester, I was always happy to be connected to RJs across departments that weren’t my own. As a double major in Theatre and English, it has been a definitive element of my liberal arts experience to be linked to a greater part of Muhlenberg through the RJ Fellows.</p>
<p>The RJ Pre-Orientation program made such an impression on me and shaped my first year at Muhlenberg so heavily that I was thrilled to be given the opportunity to serve future RJ classes as a Pre-Orientation leader. This experience was by far the most formative that the RJ program gave me across my four years at Muhlenberg. I joined the small group of student leaders and together we developed and carried forward the meaningful introduction to Muhlenberg that Pre-Orientation creates. I was able to hone my leadership skills as I worked with incoming students as well as utilize my critical perspective on the program itself — identifying where we could support our goals even more as we adapted the program. My time as a Pre-Orientation leader also gave me the opportunity to use my emotional intelligence, as I met students who were just as apprehensive as I was when I first arrived on campus. It meant so much to me to empower future RJ classes to connect and form their own communities, as well as joining and enhancing our larger student body.</p>
<p>I have found that my time as an RJ has greatly informed my experiences throughout Muhlenberg and in the larger world. The global and community-based perspective of the RJ program influenced my perspective as I took courses at Muhlenberg such as Race &amp; Performance, Intro to Sociology, Mind &amp; Brain, and even my studio acting classes. The RJ program introduced me to the Office of Community Engagement, which I worked with throughout my time as a student. We began to partner with them directly for the RJ Pre-Orientation, and our work with them gave the program a deeper connection to Allentown and an experience of service that could extend throughout a student’s four-year experience as an RJ. Through this work with the Office of Community Engagement and the RJs, I learned about the importance of forging relationships with other organizations and establishments within our shared community. This linked back to much of the material that I learned in my FYS on The Wire — emphasizing that the most productive change comes from knowing one’s community on an intimate level.</p>
<p>Overall, I cannot imagine what kind of student, artist, or thinker I would be without the RJ Fellows program. The perspective focused on change and service that the RJs have given me has dramatically shaped my views for my future. As I look ahead to a career in the performing arts and humanities, I know that having this critical eye toward community mindedness will prove invaluable for creating impactful and empowering art. I am also eternally grateful for the community of RJ scholars that I will now be apart of for my entire life — I know that that community will go with me into the world once my time at Muhlenberg is over. Thanks to the RJ Fellows program, I am excited for the future and what I can achieve with the support of an education grounded in mindful collaboration and global awareness.</p>
