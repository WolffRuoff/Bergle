								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the article, “Want to Be a Better Writer? Read More.” by Mike Hanksi reveals the seemingly endless benefits of reading. As Stephen King said, &#8220;If you don&#8217;t have time to read, you don&#8217;t have the time (or the tools) to write. Simple as that.&#8221; Reading is an essential piece to becoming a successful writer; by exposing yourself to other literary works you can implement vocabulary styles and techniques into your own writing. Unfortunately, today’s generation has become glued to a phone screen constantly checking Facebook, Twitter and Instagram at every second possible. Teenagers who think reading is pointless and a bore are truly missing out on the rewards reading has to offer.   Simply sitting down and enjoying a paperback novel is beginning to become a thing of the past. Taking just 30 minutes out of a day to read can also help overcome stress and increase empathy for others both are vital to ones mental well being. If we can learn to enjoy reading and not think of it as a daunting task all of these marvelous life qualities can be attained.</p>
<p>“Reading is fashionable. Again. It’s cool” (Hanski 2014) Hanski is conveying that those who think reading is useless and a waste of time should delve into the world of literature to become more knowledgeable and well rounded.  Spreading this idea of reading being “fashionable” and “cool” is the groundwork for a brighter future. Just think what our generation could accomplish if everyone was glued to books instead of a smartphone. Social media and mindless IPhone applications take away countless hours of time that could be spent developing your mind, broadening vocabulary and improving your overall quality of life. If reading ever does become as hip and popular as Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook we will see remarkable progress.</p>
<p>Social and physical well-being are extremely important to thrive and flourish in society. Studies have shown that those with weak reading skills tend to experience social rejection. Additionally, with everything life throws at us sometimes we need an escape from it all and reading provides that perfect escape.  In my own experiences I would escape to the fictional world of Harry Potter to relieve the stress of hard day on the field or in the classroom. Relieving stress and being included socially further add to the happiness that can be attained through reading.</p>
<p>Henski’s central idea throughout this article is to emphasize that reading is the key to mental, social and physical health.  Sitting back, relaxing and escaping into a novel is one of the most simplistic ways to constantly better yourself.  If our generation can fixate on reading over playing another round of Tiny Wings mankind will make substantial strides in all aspects of life.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are many life skills that are essential for survival in our world today. You may find yourself asking right about now what those life skills might be? Just take a minute to think. You probably came up with ideas such as knowing how to swim, or even riding a bike. But did you even think of the things that are more essential such as reading and writing? If not, writer Mike Hanski of the Huffington post might throw his hands up in frustration. The simple skills of reading and writing have the power to bring out who you truly are and what you might aspire to be one day. Overlooking these two skills and forgetting the impact they can have is detrimental. Reading and writing are the driving force in achieving one’s goals and dreams.</p>
<p>In the article “Want to Be a Better Writer? Read More”, Mike Hanski illustrates a scarcity of inspiration and motivation harming the youth of America. Children and many adults today simply do not see the importance in reading and how it can benefit their lives. Well, for starters, Hanski says, “…the more you read at school, the better your vocabulary and cognitive skills become” (Hanski, 2014 p.2). Aside from improving your vocabulary, Hanski also explains how reading can help you overcome stress, increase empathy and on top of that reading can infinitely expand your general view of this world! Reading books and stories not only allow you to travel to other places and other worlds, but they open up a gateway into your own world and imagination.</p>
<p>Now if you are reading this and still see no reason to “waste your time reading” Mike Hanski’s article was written just for you. In his article he does a fantastic job using positive words that hook his readers into thinking “hey I guess reading isn’t that bad after all”. Hanski opens up his article by saying, “Reading is fashionable. Again. It’s cool…” (Hanski, 2014 p.1).  His use of the words “fashionable” and “cool” is to prove that reading should be as popular today as using Facebook or watching TV. On the contrary, Hanski delivers the message that not reading or writing can result in unemployment and illiteracy. His persuasive language throughout the article, both positive and negative relay the importance of these two life skills that should never be overlooked.</p>
