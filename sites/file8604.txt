								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bullying has always been an issue but with technology and social media being so essential to our lives its become easy for people to bully other people online. With every social media its easy to bully someone. It is not hard to make a fake account or just message a person or even comment on peoples post. It makes it even easier due to the fact that you don’t even see the person’s reaction. But now you are on social media that is specifically for posting pictures, and you might think how could you bully someone over Instagram.</p>
<p>When I first got an Instagram I put my self on private just because I did not want random people following but I would have never thought about someone bullying on Instagram. Way too many people can see what you comment. It is not like Facebook where you might not stop and look at everyone’s post and comment. But for Instagram you purposely go on it to look at the pictures and what their captions are and you usually read the comments.  So why would any one want to even do anything mean on Instagram or any social media, it will always be brought back up. I’ve never seen any one being bullied on Instagram but I have heard of it happening.</p>
<p>When I found Cyberbullying Research Center’s blog post on Instagram and bullying I couldn’t believe all the ways you could bully someone on Instagram. They listed five different ways to bully someone and then told some people’s stories. I don’t understand why anyone would want to bully anyone but since it does happen, the big question is what do we do?</p>
<p>I see so many different adds and campaigns to stop bullying but it still seems to be going on. I truly do believe that more people need to start standing up to bullies, if you see someone getting bullied over social media then say something once one person does it I’m sure more will follow. To the person who gets bullied you might have made it better for them to see someone standing up for them. In the blog post a twelve-year-old girl posted a picture and got mean comments on it for no reason, but then that also starts the conversation of a twelve-year-old girl shouldn’t be on Instagram. At some point there should be an age limit on how old you can be to be on any social media. Someone that young shouldn’t experience hate like that. Even as a thirteen-year-old they shouldn’t have to be dealing with social media like that. Yes, it happens at any age but an 18-year-old might be able to handle a situation a little bit better then a twelve or thirteen-year-old. Cyber Bulling is a major issue in our world today and we all need to take steps to help prevent it because one day our own kids will have to be dealing with this. So trying to make social media a better place will help the future kids.</p>
