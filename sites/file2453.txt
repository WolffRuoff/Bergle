<p>Lee, E. (April 14, 2011). Google Turns in Mixed Quarter; Loses Search-Market Share. <em>Advertising Age</em>. Retrieved from <a id="internal-source-marker_0.5988184520974755" href="http://adage.com/article/digital/google-turns-mixed-quarter-loses-search-market-share/227004/">http://adage.com/article/digital/google-turns-mixed-quarter-loses-search-market-share/227004/</a></p>
<div>When Google posted its second quarter financial reports, the big news that sent Google’s shares down 5 percent was not a 27% increase in revenue to $8.58 billion, $2.3 billion in profit, or a statement by Susan Wojcicki, head of advertising products, that YouTube “is doubling revenue year over year.” Edmond Lee writes “according to search-marketing firm Experian Hitwise, Google dropped its slice of the market from 71% in the first quarter of 2010 to 66% this quarter.” Although still the dominant player in search, Google’s power as a content distributor is lessened, although from the consumers perspective the search engine distributor power role is dominated by a handful of major players, including Bing and Yahoo!.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Freshman Google CEO Larry Page downplayed the sliding search market share, emphasizing “that future growth will come outside of search, so the company is touting the big investments it’s making in display ads, YouTube, mobile and the Chrome web browser.” In a nod to a power roles analysis, Google’s recent acquisition of Next New Networks, “which helps promote webshows and package them to advertisers,” has “prompted Google to set aside as much as $100 million to finance more production across many content partnerships.”Google takes in much of its revenue by leveraging the client power role, and is not known as a producer of content, but rather as an exhibitor (YouTube).</p>
<p>Yet, in a develop specific to the Internet industry, unregulated vertical integration is widely embraced by conglomerates such as Google and Yahoo!. It is a logical conclusion, as cross-promotion (through the linking pin power role) creates a synergistic web audience (which equals advertising revenue) across Google owned (or controlled) distribution, exhibition and production organizations. For instance, one could search Google, click on a search result for a YouTube video, and consume a video produced by a firm financed Google’s $100 million investment in content production; all the while exposed to advertisements displayed by DoubleClick (owned by Google).</p>
