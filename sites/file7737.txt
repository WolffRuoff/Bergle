								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The info graph <em>A Day In The Life Of The Internet  </em>by Michael Keshan, portrays many facts and knowledge of the internet and its usage  throughout the world. Billions of people use the internet every day for one reason or another, whether its shopping, sending emails or even as a leisure activity. Over 144 billion emails are sent each day, 89 billion which are business related, over 5.9 billion searches happen a day and over 717 million dollars are spent a day on online shopping. All of these aspects of the internet most definitely improve daily life as it is a faster means of achieving something. I know from experience how the internet can make your life easier. When I am studying for my exams or doing homework and I do not know the answer to something, the internet gives me a easy  and quick way to find the answer to my problem. That being said, not everyone across the world has access to the internet. Only 63 percent of people in Europe have internet access, only 42 percent of people in South America and only 27 percent in Asia. Is that to say that all of those people without access have worse lives than those with access. There is no doubt having the internet comes with its advantages, however those without it might not think its an essential part to a good life.</p>
