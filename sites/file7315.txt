								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> The term “ownership” in the relatively newly-developed, ever-evolving digital world we live in has begun to take on a different meaning. What was once based on sole physical possession of an item is now beginning to change as the digital world continues to develop and mature.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> It seems there is no such thing as full-ownership in the digital world anymore. Everything we obtain online is essentially just a lease – a lease granting us access to use, borrow, share, and explore. Nothing is truly owned. We are simply claiming something as our own for a specified period of time; however, it is never really ours.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Similar to what occurs in the real world, these possessions can easily be taken away. We can lose licenses and have access revoked to materials because we do not have genuine authority over the content. Which raises several questions. Who really has authority over such material? Who truly owns these products and services? What can be changed to grant us ownership over the content we seek to take ownership of?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> The concept of ownership online is a shady one. There are many complexities associated with it due to the very fact that we do not know who rightly owns the content or material. As Sian Lindley mentioned in her TedTalk, Rethinking ownership in the digital age, we do not know where the borders lie when it comes to our own digital ownership.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Since we often confuse access with ownership and possession we find ourselves giving up rights to large corporations who operate solely for-profit. We are given some control over what we can post and what we decide to share. Realistically, we are deprived of much more in the way of control or protection of our online content. If we try to relinquish ownership we do so with an expectation in can be easily done, since the page is no longer accessible to others eyes. However, because we never truly had ownership the corporation, who is the real owner, still maintains the final decision with respect to what actually becomes of that content.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="yiv2340228953yui_3_16_0_1_1476194798227_2669">Of course I have Googled myself before. I cannot imagine anyone would be able to say differently. Interestingly, each time I did it was it was with the expectation of hoping to see some stats about a sporting event I recently played in. I expected to read about my sports accomplishments.<span id="yiv2340228953yui_3_16_0_1_1476194798227_2670">  </span>Candidly speaking, I was focused on simply being mentioned since with each published stat my popularity rose amongst my peers and in sports circles.<span id="yiv2340228953yui_3_16_0_1_1476194798227_2671">  </span>With each new sporting event came more name recognition, photos and videos. In all candor, I never really paid much attention to the details. <span id="yiv2340228953yui_3_16_0_1_1476194798227_2672"> </span>Instead, my focus was seeing my stats in print for all to see and the sport’s action photos that usually accompanied the posts.<span id="yiv2340228953yui_3_16_0_1_1476194798227_2673">  </span>I didn’t expect to find anything else—sports is who I am.</div>
<div id="yiv2340228953yui_3_16_0_1_1476194798227_2675"></div>
<div id="yiv2340228953yui_3_16_0_1_1476194798227_2677">This project reinforced what I already knew—most of what is posted about me revolves around sports. Admittedly, each new post helped fuel my self-confidence, motivation and competitive edge. The posts provided positive reinforcement for me and I sough them out. Yes, there was a site here or there that talked about other things such as scholarships received or community projects but for the most part is was all about sports. <span id="yiv2340228953yui_3_16_0_1_1476194798227_2678"> </span>I have managed to keep my private live just that –private&#8211;and I hope to keep it that way. Naturally, there would be exceptions for certain milestones and events that could help me achieve certain goals or are worthy of sharing because of the positive values they evoke and inspire. <span id="yiv2340228953yui_3_16_0_1_1476194798227_2679"> </span></div>
<div id="yiv2340228953yui_3_16_0_1_1476194798227_2681"></div>
<div id="yiv2340228953yui_3_16_0_1_1476194798227_2689" dir="ltr"><span id="yiv2340228953yui_3_16_0_1_1476194798227_2683">I am hoping that five years from now when people Google my name there is more to read about me that just my sports accomplishments. Recognition for community service projects, work accomplishments and promotions, travel experiences and positive news about my development as a person is what I hope they read about me</span></div>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our digital identity is the person we want people to think we are. We only share with the world the things we want them to know about us. We can be whoever we want digitally, because we control what people see. We have all different versions of ourselves. As Sherry Turkle states in <em>Sherry Turkle of MIT: How social media impacts to your identity (Part 2)</em>, &#8220;We have the version of our self we present to our friends and even our families in real life, then we have the version of ourselves we have in our private moments with ourselves, we have the version of our self online like on Facebook or Twitter, and we may have secret accounts where we have another version of our self that we prefer to hide from others&#8221;. We behave differently and express ourselves differently in various settings. I know that I behave in different settings. For example, the head of youth group from my church at home requested to follow my Instagram and I did not let him because it is not professional and I do not need him to see me in a different setting and see what I do outside of the church. My Instagram is for my peers and family to see my photos, I do not need a middle aged man that works at my church to see my photos.</p>
<p>In the other video, <em>Fake It- to control your digital identity: Pernille Tranberg at TEDxOxford, </em>it is actually recommended to use fake identities on social media like Facebook. This way your friends can know that it is actually you. It is like a screen name used for video games and there is a website that creates the fake name for you to make it easy. Creating this fake identity is all about &#8220;Controlling who knows what about you when&#8221; (Tranberg). It isn&#8217;t meant to create a whole other persona, it is to protect yourself from strangers and others that do not need to know everything about you because people (especially teens in my experience) tend to over share on social medias.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When asked to “describe yourself,” the response is usually your name, where you’re from, what organizations you are a part of, and maybe some of your most distinguishing qualities. However, an online identity is a lot more complicated. In her TED talk, Pernielle Tranberg confesses that she had a fake online identity for 5 years to avoid companies from knowing too much (Tranberg, 2013). She pushes her audience to not reveal lots of information online, although many people post everything about themselves on the Internet. Social media has pushed the boundary of what privacy is; the scariest part is that so many people are unaware of their online sense (or senses) of self. In her interview, Sherry Turkle mentions how she met a young man who claims that “Twitter has trained me that I have to be ironic and witty,…but I can’t get followers on Twitter unless I’m a certain kind of ironic and witty person” (Mainwaring, 2011). Personally I can understand the idea of a multiplicity of identities online: I post different photos to Instagram than I would Facebook. Specifically, my Instagram posts are more carefully edited, while I would post almost anything on Facebook. Sherry Turkle wants her audience to embrace the idea of living multiple online lives. Any technological evolution is essentially impossible to reverse, since all information online is saved and used by companies. So while Tranberg encourages us to hide oursleves, Turkle understands that the world is evolving and that us humans need to evolve along with the technology.</p>
