								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Child maltreatment can be defined as the intentional or reckless doing of any physical, emotional, or mental harm to a child. Examples of child maltreatment include, but are not limited to: bodily injury, serious physical neglect of a child, fabricating or the intentionally exaggerating of a medical symptom or disease, sexual abuse or exploitation of a child, etc. In Pennsylvania, the Child Protective Services Law was passed to protect children from abuse, allow the opportunity for healthy growth and development, as well as preserve and stabilize the family. The abuse is considered recent if it happened within a two-year range of when the report is made to ChildLine, however, there is no time limit for sexual abuse, serious mental injury, serious physical neglect and deaths. A few examples of people who can be considered perpetrators of child abuse are: a parent, a person who is 14 years of age or older that is responsible for the welfare of the child, a relative in same home as the child (or not) who is 18 years old or older. Mandatory reporters do not have to determine if a person is or isn’t meeting the criteria of a perpetrator to make a report. You are considered a mandatory reported (and required to report suspected child abuse) if you are: licensed or certified in any health-related field, a medical examiner, an employee of a health care facility who is engaged with the child, a school employee, or the employee of a child-care service who has direct contact with the child, just to name a few. Mandatory reporters must make a report if they have reasonable cause to suspect that a child is/had experienced child abuse and if they: are directly responsible for the care or training of the child (or work for an agency that does this), or a person makes a disclosure to the reporter. Abuse can also be reported to ChildLine or a county youth agency if there are concerns for the general safety and wellbeing of the child such as inadequate clothing, housing or supervision. Reports of suspected child abuse can be submitted to ChildLine’s website (<a href="http://www.compass.state.pa.us/cwis)">www.compass.state.pa.us/cwis)</a>or by calling 1-800-932-0313.
