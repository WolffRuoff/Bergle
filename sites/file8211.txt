					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Great post! I definitely agree that reading and writing are overshadowed in the world we live in with immediate access to technology. I also think that you were wise to emphasize Hanski&#039;s point that not reading and writing can lead to unemployment. Reading and writing lay the foundation for communication, as I mentioned in my post, and without these two skills communicating becomes all the more challenging. Having difficulty communicating certainly puts you at a disadvantage while searching for a job. Of course, landing a job is even tougher if you lack the necessary skills for that career because you have not read vital information.&lt;/p&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I like the way you opened up with real life examples. We have some similar points. Most people have been reading ever since they were a couple years old. Starting with small phrases and as time went on more and more sophisticated topics. It&#039;s almost like the first book you read gives puts you in a direction. And then another, over and over again. Along the way we learned who we truly are, what we like/dislike and improved our vocabulary as well as writing skills. Learning has been a process ever since we were very young and Hanski tells us that improving/learning never stops. As life goes on, you only learn more about yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
