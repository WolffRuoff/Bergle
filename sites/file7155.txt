<p>In my management course at Muhlenberg I was assigned a a team that I would be working with for the entirety of the semester. The four of us had to do a number of presentations together which required a significant amount of teamwork, cooperation, and listening.</p>
<p>Through this experience I learned a lot about my personal strengths and weaknesses as well as the strengths and weaknesses of my group members.</p>
<p>Each week my team and I would meet to discuss our upcoming presentation and decide what the best way to split up the work would be. The evening before each presentation we met and did a practice run of the work to see how long it would be and to flush out any errors that may have came up.</p>
<p>As the semester went on our grades and feedback from peers and professors reflected how much teamwork played into our journey as a group. We became more comfortable with one another socially, and more knowledgable about one another academically.</p>
<p>I feel that this class and this group is a major reason that I have the teamwork skills that I do now. See below to see some of the work my teammates and I accomplished.</p>
