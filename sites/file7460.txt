								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Although I have Googled myself before, I never paid attention to any of the details – the articles about somebody else named Michael Ellick, the links that come up under the sub categories such as videos, news and shopping, or the pictures of other people who share the same last name as I do. All of the previous times I Googled myself, I was looking to see if I would show up on Google images after typing my name into the search bar, which I did. This time I paid attention to all of the details, and was surprised, to say the least.</p>
<p>The first few things that come up after Googling my name have nothing to do with me, but somebody else named Michael Ellick. It turns out that Michael Ellick is a former Minister, and a current Reverend at the Judson Memorial Church in New York City. The next few links took me to profiles of people named Michael Ellick on Facebook, and the Twitter account of the Minister. After clicking on ‘images’, I only found one picture of myself, which was my Twitter profile picture. I also came across a picture of my uncle, pictures that have been tweeted from my twitter account, and pictures of Michael Phelps, Michael Jordan, and the Minister Michael Ellick. I was surprised to have only seen one picture of myself. Next I clicked on ‘news,’ and was surprised. On September 23 I had been stopped on the way to one of my classes at Muhlenberg by the Lehigh Valley News, who were interviewing students about how they feel about political posts on social media. I had forgotten that I had been interviewed, so watching the interview was both exciting and nerve-racking, as I said that “I would probably unfriend them or unfollow them” (referring to people who post about politics) on camera. If I had known that they were going to post the interview online, I probably would have changed my answer, and said something a little nicer. Regardless, I am very satisfied and comfortable with what comes up when my name is entered into Google. There is nothing there that I am uncomfortable with or embarrassed about, and moving forward I will make it a habit to Google myself to assure that there continues to be nothing that can appear as negative under my name.</p>
