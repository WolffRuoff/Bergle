								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the ever evolving world today, teens have become so accustomed to the presence and use of technology in their day to day lives. With the existence of technology, comes the ever-growing want and need of two top priorities: to be connected to friends, family, and strangers around the world and to have one’s privacy remain intact while doing so. In July 2011, the wants and needs of the aforementioned teens came true via the release of Snapchat. The app was created by Evan Spiegel, Bobby Murphy, and Reggie Brown as a requirement for a course at Stanford University (“Snapchat,” 2015).  The app’s platform encourages users to send candid pictures of whatever it is that they are doing in that moment. The unsaved photos are then sent to user’s friends and are deleted after a maximum of ten seconds which is set by the sender. Although this form of social media sounds utopic, are teens relying so heavily on the assumption that the pictures are deleted forever that they let their guard down? The answer is yes.</p>
<p>An increased sense of privacy is typically accompanied by an increased sense of indestructibility. Within the four years that Snapchat has been up and running, sexting has become overwhelmingly popular because users believe that once the content disappears after the time limit expires, it is gone forever (“Snapchat,” 2015). Contrary to popular belief, Snapchat’s main privacy page states that “there may be ways to access messages while still in temporary storage on recipients’ devices or, forensically, even after they are deleted (“Privacy Policy,” 2014).” Therefore, users of Snapchat are being deceived by themselves. By not knowing the full parameters of the app, one is acting in ways that they would not if they did not believe the app was private. The fact that this not-really-private-privacy is not hidden but rather in regular sized text on the main webpage of Snapchat, shows that teens are not looking carefully at what they are agreeing to when signing up for an account. Consequently, I believe that teens today allow themselves to get into the trouble that they are getting in because they are too quick to believe what they want to be true.</p>
