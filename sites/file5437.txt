								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the past 7 years, as part of my work advising the <strong>Sedehi Diversity Project</strong>, I’ve been privileged to partake in some amazing conversations with Muhlenberg community members about what diversity means. Those conversations have taught me a lot, especially about the inaccurate assumptions people make about one another.</p>
<p>One of the biggest inaccurate assumptions I’ve encountered is that we all mean the same thing when we use the word “diversity.” Hoo boy, is this ever not the case! I’ve learned that there are a lot of different definitions of diversity floating around out there. A. Lot.</p>
<p>One of the most common ones is that diversity refers to the multiple ways people can be different from one another. And I guess that’s not really inaccurate, at least not when you think about the word divorced from history.</p>
<p>The problem is though, when you do that – when you think about diversity as disconnected from a history in which some people have been systematically oppressed – you end up in conversations about “diversity of shoe-size” and “diversity of interests.” And is that really what we want to be talking about? Sound boring and pointless? You&#8217;re feelin&#8217; me here, aren&#8217;t you?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m thinking about this because today someone asked me what my definition of diversity was. And because it surprised them – and because it surprised <em>me</em> that it surprised them – I figured I’d get all bloggy and share it here.</p>
<p>To me, diversity refers to <strong>the work that communities do</strong> to expose and dismantle the systems of oppression that inhibit the thriving presence and influence of people who have been historically underrepresented, or people who have marginalized identities. In that way, I guess diversity is more ‘verbish’ than ‘nounish’ to me. It&#8217;s work. It&#8217;s work that we all have the responsibility to do.</p>
<p>That’s my definition. What’s yours?</p>
