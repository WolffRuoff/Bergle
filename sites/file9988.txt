			<p><em>Profiles of senior Muhlenberg athletes are published in game programs in the sports of field hockey, football, soccer, volleyball, basketball, wrestling, baseball, softball, lacrosse and tennis, usually on that sport’s Senior Day.</em></p>
<p><em>As part of the Year in Review, here are some of the best responses in the Q&amp;A profiles from the winter and spring athletes.</em></p>
<p><strong>Matt O’Hara, Men&#8217;s Basketball</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you could trade places with anyone for a day, who would it be? </strong>Truthfully, in a completely non-weird way, I’d love to be on the girls’ basketball team. They have the best team chemistry at this school and some of my best friends are on that team: Julie Kelly, Alita Zabrecky and Kate Clawson, plus the whole sophomore class. They are a great team with great girls who have a ton of fun together.</p>

<p><strong>What was it like student teaching this past fall semester? </strong>Student teaching and playing basketball was an enjoyable hell. I would wake up every morning at six and hang out with a bunch of little prepubescent eighth graders. It was great because they would actually get my jokes and appreciate me acting like an idiot for their entertainment. After I was done yelling at those little whirling dervishes, and maybe teaching them a thing or two about the Mayan Empire, I would drive back to school, shove food down my throat and then get yelled at during practice. In the midst of all of this chaos, I would somehow do homework and sleep (sometimes during practice&#8230;) and I eventually became a master of the chaos. The worst part about all of this running around was that I loved every second of my time being Mr. Lags.</p>
<p><strong>Alita Zabrecky, Women&#8217;s Basketball</strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s the most memorable game of your Muhlenberg career? </strong>My most memorable game was, by far, my freshman year at Gettysburg. For some reason Coach had both Kate Clawson and I on the floor late in the game, down by one, with just seconds to go. We had the ball on the sideline out of bounds and our play was designed to get either Kelly [McKeon] or Alex [Chili] the ball so they could shoot, but they were not able to get open so by default, they had to pass to me. I started dribbling toward the basket and the next thing I know I am dribbling the ball off of my foot, thankfully right in the direction of Kate who snatched it up off of the floor. Once Kate had secured the ball I figured my best bet was just to stay out of the way and run to the basket to grab a rebound if someone missed a shot. After almost turning the ball over, I figured I probably should not be taking the last shot of the game. Kate now throws the ball into Sheila Cook in the post, and as I am making my way to the basket, Sheila throws the ball to me, assuming I am making a cut and that I wanted the ball (which I did not). It bounced off my chest, and I caught it and laid it in for the game-winning bucket. This play was by far the most dysfunctional game-winning play I have ever been a part of. I am just thankful that I made the layup given my track record of missed layups.</p>

<p><strong>How did you get started playing lacrosse? </strong>I started playing lacrosse when I was 10 years old and in fourth grade. My career conveniently started when my baseball career ended (I didn&#8217;t make the travel team). It&#8217;s a funny story actually. The night I found out I didn&#8217;t make the baseball team, I also found out my pet hermit crab died, so that was a rough night.</p>

<p align="left"><strong>What was it like playing with your brother at Muhlenberg? </strong>Since I was born, my brother was always right there at my side &#8230; By the time I was a senior in high school, &#8230; the only one I had in mind was Muhlenberg so I could play with my brother. When spring of my freshman year finally came, it felt like Christmas came early. As the team hit the field for the first time, I just saw my brother and I walking out to the backyard to have a catch. When lined up to guard him in practice, he’ll say he got the best of my every time, but he doesn’t want to admit his little brother came in as a freshman and put him on an island day in and day out. It was one thing to practice together, but to play in the games with each other made it even more special. Hearing, &#8220;Carpetto brothers you’re next on defense&#8221; was something that gave me chills every game.</p>

<p><strong>Describe Coach DeStasio in one word. </strong>I would describe Coach DeStasio as a “non-hugger.” This year we divided our team into “huggers” and the “touch me and die” group, otherwise known as “non-huggers.” Having grown up with the president of the “huggers,” Angie Sisco, I am definitely part of the “non-hugging” group and it’s great to have a coach that shares my views on this matter.</p>

<p><strong>This is your second year as team captain. What has been the most rewarding part of leading the team for two years? </strong>The most rewarding part of being captain is being able to see all of my fellow teammates grow not only as tennis players, but as people – on and off the court. On the court especially, I have seen so many of my fellow teammates get more and more confident in their games and play some truly amazing tennis. Every one of them motivates me to be a better tennis player and even though I am captain, I think I look up to them for all that they do and their tennis skills. We spend so much time together during the season and I feel really lucky to have met such a smart, fun, loving group of girls … I am so honored to hold this position for my team.</p>

<p><strong>Do you have any pregame rituals or superstitions? </strong>My teammates will call me the most superstitious person on the team, and I’d have to agree. I’ve been wearing the same bow in my hair for game day throughout my four years here. I have two main rituals &#8211; one is taking a shower before every game. I started doing this my freshman year and when I started having success on the field, I knew I had to keep it. It’s a way of thinking about the game and what I want to accomplish. The second ritual also started my freshman year &#8211; a senior at the time (Alyssa Bascelli) told me about her pregame ritual of eating a pint of Ben &amp; Jerry’s ice cream the night before every game. She informed us that someone had to do it with her so that when she graduated, it would get passed down. I was the willing (and maybe not so intelligent) freshman who said, “Sure!” and proceeded to eat a pint of Ben &amp; Jerry’s Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough ice cream the night before every game. I have for all four years and now that I am graduating, I have passed the ritual down to freshmen Rachel Pedersen and Casey Armstrong. You guys better not disappoint me!</p>

<p><strong>Your middle name, Zoe, is pretty unique. Were you named after someone? </strong>I am named after my Greek grandmother (my Yiayia) whose name was Bessie Zoe Athanasiou. Zoe means “life” in Greek and was the perfect portrayal of my Yiayia who is sadly no longer with us. We also both had only one dimple on our left cheeks. This was something we shared and something she always loved about the two of us. I am honored to be named after my Yiayia, and her spirit lives on and will continue to live on through me as I share her name.  </p>

<p><strong>What’s it like having six siblings? Are you the youngest, oldest or in the middle? </strong>I am the third oldest of seven. My brother, Joey, is the oldest, then I have one older sister, Kelly, and four younger sisters, Erin, Mary Kate, Maggie and Tara. People generally feel sorry for my brother for being the only boy, but they shouldn’t because he is treated like a king (and acts like it). The biggest issue with having six siblings, and especially five sisters, is that you cannot leave any personal items unattended, especially clothing, because you will never get it back.</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Rechten, Baseball</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do you have any pregame rituals or superstitions? </strong>I have way too many superstitions and rituals to even name them all – from the way I put on my cleats to the made-up gibberish language our catcher Brett Rosen and I use to communicate before I pitch. The most meaningful and consistent ritual I have revolves around the word “trust.” The importance of this word was instilled in me by my high school coach. Before the inning begins he would tell me to clear off the mound and envision the word trust printed on the rubber. This year I printed it on the brim of my hat. It has served as my anchor, allowing me to take all the emotion out of the situation and focus on doing my job for our team.</p>

<p><strong>How is it being teammates with Ryan Rechten? </strong>As a player, Ryan is one of the more loose and goofy kids on the team – he always has something ridiculous to say. The best part about this is that it makes everyone around him relaxed and reminds us that baseball is just a game and that we must treat it that way if we want to be successful. What I commend him for is his ability to joke around and have fun in the bullpen for six innings of the game and then turn it on right around the sixth knowing that it is his job to come in late and shut the door against the opposing team. I couldn’t think of a better person to have in this role as I have all the confidence in the world that he will come in and get outs in a hurry.</p>

<p><strong>What’s it like having nine older siblings? </strong>Having nine older siblings is the most incredible thing in my life. It is something that I truly treasure. I am so blessed to have them because they have truly made me into the person I am today. They mean more to me than words can capture. I wear the number nine to represent them.</p>
<p><strong>Robert Appleby, Baseball</strong></p>
<p><strong>How did you get started playing baseball and what’s your first memory of playing?</strong>I’m not really sure how I got started but when I did start playing at the age of 4, I was instantly obsessed. My first memory of actually playing baseball was my first year of tee ball. The league rules were that there were no outs and each team got to hit through the lineup every inning. I remember being at shortstop when this kid hit a line drive to me, which I caught and doubled off the runner at first base. Even though I made the play, he still got to stay on base. I remember how excited I was when I was old enough to play in the league where you could actually get people out. As a hitter now, I take back ever thinking that.</p>

			<p>When Muhlenberg and Dickinson teams meet on the court or the field, it is usually a battle between the red and white. At tomorrow’s women’s lacrosse game, however, the color scheme will be quite a bit different.</p>
<p>Both Muhlenberg and Dickinson will be donning special pink and teal shirts to raise awareness for breast and ovarian cancer. The team will also be collecting donations for the Sloan Kettering Cancer Center at their game as well as at the men’s game later that night.</p>
<p>Senior midfielder Ali Gabriele and her high school teammate, Chloe Golod, who plays for Dickinson, have more in common than just their love of lacrosse – their mothers have both battled cancer.</p>
<p>In the fall, the former teammates discussed the idea of doing something special at this year’s game in honor of their moms.<a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/04/teal-shirts.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1735 alignleft" title="Muhlenberg Women's Lacrosse" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/04/teal-shirts-300x196.jpg" alt="Muhlenberg Women's Lacrosse" width="300" height="196" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/04/teal-shirts-300x196.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/04/teal-shirts-1024x670.jpg 1024w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/04/teal-shirts-458x300.jpg 458w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/04/teal-shirts.jpg 1965w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>“My mom has ovarian cancer and her mom has had breast cancer, so that’s how the whole idea originated,” explained Gabriele.</p>
<p>“We didn’t think we would be able to do shirts and wear them as jerseys, but [athletic director Corey Goff] said we could do it as long as the colors were readable for the refs,” she added. “We got it all approved and ordered the shirts and are wearing them tomorrow as our jerseys.”</p>
<p>Pink is nationally recognized as a symbol of breast cancer, and teal is used to symbolize ovarian cancer.</p>
<p>Gabriele says she has played lacrosse with Golod since they were about 8 years old.</p>
<p>While her friend’s mother battled breast cancer many years ago, Gabriele’s experience with the disease has been more recent.<a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/04/team-huddle.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1738" title="Muhlenberg Women's Lacrosse" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/04/team-huddle-300x263.jpg" alt="Muhlenberg Women's Lacrosse" width="300" height="263" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/04/team-huddle-300x263.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/04/team-huddle-1024x900.jpg 1024w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/04/team-huddle-341x300.jpg 341w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>Her mother was first diagnosed at the end of her freshman year at Muhlenberg and was re-diagnosed again this fall. She is almost done with her chemo treatments this time around.</p>
<p>“It’s kind of been an ongoing thing since I’ve been in college,” stated Gabriele of her mother’s illness. “It’s tough, but she’s really strong and doesn’t give up. She’s totally a fighter and has that go-getter attitude.”</p>
<p>The lacrosse team, especially the senior class, has been a support system for Gabriele throughout the years.</p>
<p>“They’re my best friends, so I’m always around them and able to talk to them about it.</p>
<p>“We’ve done Relay For Life the past three years, so we’re always doing something to raise money for cancer,” she recalled. “But this year I wanted to do something more related to what I’ve gone through. So organizing this game, especially with one of my best friends from home, was a perfect way to do that.”</p>
<p>Although it’s been harder for her mother to come to games since being diagnosed again, especially with all the cold weather, she has still been able to come to many <a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/04/gabriele-blog-post.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1734" title="Senior midfielder Ali Gabriele" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/04/gabriele-blog-post-180x300.jpg" alt="Ali Gabriele" width="180" height="300" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/04/gabriele-blog-post-180x300.jpg 180w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/04/gabriele-blog-post-617x1024.jpg 617w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/04/gabriele-blog-post.jpg 1548w" sizes="(max-width: 180px) 100vw, 180px" /></a>home games, even if she has to watch them from inside the Life Sports Center.</p>
<p>“She just really wants to be here,” said Gabriele.</p>
<p>And she will be here tomorrow, along with Gabriele’s father, for the game that will honor her battle with cancer and help raise awareness and support for others who are going through the same battle. Golod’s parents will also be in attendance.</p>
<p>As the mothers, who Gabriele says are “pretty good friends,” cheer for their daughters’ teams tomorrow, they will know that this special game was organized by two best friends – although those friends will be rivals for 60 minutes.</p>
<p>“I always really want to win this game against Dickinson because I want to beat her,” said Gabriele. “She’s beaten us the last three years, so I really want to win this year.”</p>

			<p>As the sun shined down on Scotty Wood Stadium, anyone in attendance for yesterday&#8217;s women’s lacrosse game witnessed a rare sight. Before the starting lineups were announced, my team and Widener forgot the name on the front of our jerseys and stood silently as one team, one unit, and one family. Surrounding the Mule emblem, my teammates, coaches and I held the hand of two Pride players in order to remember a tragedy that struck among the national lacrosse family.</p>
<p>I’m sure you know that I’m referring to the tragic accident that left the Seton Hill University women’s lacrosse team and community in despair. Coach Kristina Quigley died on Saturday after the bus swerved off the road en route to a matchup with Millersville University. Multiple players also sustained injuries.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/03/play4setonhill_logo.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1688" title="Play 4 Seton Hill logo" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/03/play4setonhill_logo.jpg" alt="" width="403" height="390" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/03/play4setonhill_logo.jpg 403w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/03/play4setonhill_logo-300x290.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/03/play4setonhill_logo-310x300.jpg 310w" sizes="(max-width: 403px) 100vw, 403px" /></a>A non-identified group created a Facebook page called <em>Play 4 Seton Hill</em>. This page is not only receiving national attention among fellow lacrosse players but also among all athletes, playing a variety of sports, at all levels. With the simple request to wear crimson and gold ribbon in their laces, sports teams have unified themselves in order to show support for the Lady Griffins and the Seton Hill University community.</p>
<p>Over the years, all athletes have been asked the same basic questions: “Why do you love the game so much?” “What is so great about being an athlete?” Whether you’re fighting through an injury or riding a low during your season, many athletes have asked themselves the same questions. Although there are an infinite amount of answers, there is one that is universal among all athletes: “I belong to a team. I belong to a family.”</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/03/wlaxbig_MB032113.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1691" title="Play 4 Seton Hill" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/03/wlaxbig_MB032113.jpg" alt="" width="780" height="444" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/03/wlaxbig_MB032113.jpg 780w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/03/wlaxbig_MB032113-300x170.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/03/wlaxbig_MB032113-500x284.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" /></a></p>
<p>To non-athletes that might sound cliché, but to anyone who has ever played a team sport, the response is as natural as breathing. The Seton Hill accident made me realize that being an athlete is not only belonging to the team you play for, but also belonging to “One Family” on a national scale.</p>
<p>Playing for the cure, volunteering with children, or in this case, playing in memoriam, are only a few examples of how athletes from the same sport come together as one family in order to show their support for the community. Playing for and honoring Seton Hill is no exception as lacrosse teams across the nation have united under the slogan, “OneLaxFamily.”  </p>
<p>Whether you’re an athlete planning to go pro or one praying that you will find a decent job after graduation, some of your most satisfying memories come from the little things you’ve participated in during your athletic career. Although the Seton Hill accident is a memory of sorrow, I believe that numerous lacrosse teams and the sports community have responded and continue to respond with care and grace.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/03/play4setonhill_2.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1690" title="Play 4 Seton Hill" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/03/play4setonhill_2-300x252.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="252" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/03/play4setonhill_2-300x252.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/03/play4setonhill_2-356x300.jpg 356w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/03/play4setonhill_2.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>It is a clear reminder that playing a sport is not all about the championships or recognition, but instead about the camaraderie and the unification by a group of individuals who choose to share one common love. Being a part of <em>Play 4 Seton Hill</em> allowed my teammates, coaches and I to show our common love, respect and support for the not only the sport of lacrosse, but also anyone else who identifies themselves with the lacrosse family. Having the opportunity to partake in moments like <em>Play 4 Seton Hill</em> is a primary example of why I take pride in being a Mule.</p>

			<p><em><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/02/shegoskihs.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-781" title="Jessica Shegoski" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/02/shegoskihs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>A couple of weeks ago, recent Muhlenberg graduate Jessica Shegoski <a title="Bagels and Lax, Part 1" href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/?p=1249">wrote about the first half of her lacrosse trip to Europe and Israel</a>, in which she helped Israel win the championship at the European Lacrosse Festival in Amsterdam.</em></p>
<p><em>Here is her report on the second half of the trip, which involved a series of clinics designed to introduce the sport of lacrosse to Israelis &#8211; as well as plenty of sightseeing.</em></p>
<p><strong>July 1</strong></p>
<p>Woke up this morning to another glorious, I mean FULL day of traveling. The team was split up on a couple different flights to either head home to the states, head home to Israel, or like me head to Israel to coach and play.</p>
<p>The first leg of our flight was Amsterdam to Bucharest (Romania). The airport was small in terms of United States standards. We had to deplane by walking down a set of stairs to a bus that took us to the terminal and had to take a similar bus back out to the tarmac for our flight to Tel Aviv. We got to Tel Aviv around 8:30 at night and caught a cab to our hostel to meet the two other teammates who had arrived ahead of us. The four of us hung out and walked the beach until everyone else who was staying at the hostel arrived around 2:00 am.</p>
<p>Since everyone felt gross from traveling all day, we all decided the smartest decision was to throw on bathing suits and jump into the ocean at 2:30 in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>July 2</strong></p>
<p>We had no clinics or games planned for today so everyone took complete advantage of being right on the beach. By 11:00 am everyone who was staying in the hostel [was] on the beach, and none of us left the beach for the rest of the day (except perhaps to grab food and more water). </p>
<p><strong>July 3</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_clinic1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1286" title="lax clinic 1" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_clinic1.jpg" alt="" width="295" height="168" /></a>This morning there was a clinic south of Tel Aviv, and after coaching we all hung out on the beach. As we were sitting on the beach we all decided that we wanted to be All-American (literally) for the next day (July 4), so the girls headed to find clothing to wear and a special piece of clothing for the boys.</p>
<p><strong>July 4 (Happy Independence Day America)</strong></p>
<p>Clinic #2, this time in Netanya with a group of low-income and at-risk kids who were initially more interested in the soccer ball someone had instead of lacrosse. It was funny how sassy some of the little girls were, but they were very fun to teach and work with.  </p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_swimsuit.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1291" title="American swimsuits" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_swimsuit.jpg" alt="" width="280" height="378" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_swimsuit.jpg 280w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_swimsuit-222x300.jpg 222w" sizes="(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px" /></a>Once the clinic ended it was off to the beach for us, the girls sporting their newly acquired American flag bikinis and the guys in their lovely American flag swimsuits.</p>
<p><strong>July 5</strong></p>
<p>Clinic #3 &#8211; This time we traveled to Kraft Stadium in Jerusalem to coach. This was the first clinic where the majority of the kids attending did speak English, which made coaching a little bit easier. After coaching all morning we were given the day to explore Jerusalem (where the majority of us had previously been on other trips).  </p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_westernwall.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1285" title="Jessica Shegoski at the Western Wall" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_westernwall.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="256" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_westernwall.jpg 450w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_westernwall-300x170.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a>We headed towards the Jaffa Gate into the Old City and made our way to the Western Wall, where we placed our notes into the ancient cracks in the wall. (It is Jewish tradition to write a prayer or note on a small slip of paper and then deposit it in the cracks of the wall.)</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_helmet.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1290" title="women's players in helmets" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_helmet.jpg" alt="" width="244" height="326" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_helmet.jpg 244w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_helmet-224x300.jpg 224w" sizes="(max-width: 244px) 100vw, 244px" /></a>After exploring most of the afternoon, we made our way back to Kraft Stadium (yes the same Krafts of Patriots football fame) to get changed for our games. The two men’s club teams (Jerusalem and Tel Aviv) played three games, and the women’s team had exhibition intrasquad games in between the men’s games. As the men’s third game was winding down, some of the women’s team joked that we wanted to play with them too and threw on full pads and tried to sneak our way onto the field. But it didn’t work.</p>
<p><strong>July 6</strong></p>
<p>Woke up early to get on the bus for our team retreat up north. Thank you to the UJA Federation of New York for sponsoring the retreat. Both the Americans and the Israelis boarded our coach bus early in the morning to begin our drive to Caesarea, a city built by Herod the Great that served as the capital when Palestine was under Roman control and was used through the time of the Crusades as a major port. After touring the ruins we got back on the bus to head to the northern port city <a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_haifa.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1289" title="Haifa" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_haifa.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="332" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_haifa.jpg 250w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_haifa-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px" /></a>of Haifa, where we quickly ate lunch and then went to the Bahi Gardens (the hanging gardens of Haifa), which house the shrine of the Bab. The gardens were beautiful and so amazingly well manicured.</p>
<p>Then it was off to the city of Akko, which is across the bay from Haifa and one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world.  After exploring Akko and all its back alleys and markets, we got back on the bus to drive to the kibbutz that we were staying at for the weekend. The guesthouse at Kibbutz Nof Ginnossar was basically a hotel and we were right on the Kinneret (Sea of Galilee, Israel’s largest freshwater lake). The guesthouse and the Kinneret are located in a valley, and because of this we were able to sit on the shoreline and watch the moon rise up and over the mountains.</p>
<p><strong>July 7</strong></p>
<p>Another early morning to explore more of northern Israel; our first stop was the Golan Heights. We all piled into Jeep Wranglers with extended beds and started our off-roading trip up the mountains that surround the fertile valleys of the Golan. While you drive through the Golan you experience something that you don’t encounter in the States: Barbed wire surrounds areas that are marked with signs that read “Caution: Mines.” This is because the area was disputed between Israel and Syria and is scattered with still-live mines and bombed-out bunkers.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_golan.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1288" title="Jessica Shegoski at the Golan Heights" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_golan.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="263" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_golan.jpg 350w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_golan-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" /></a>After off-roading we headed to a kibbutz that I had visited on my previous trip to Israel. [Then] we headed to Mt. Bental, which holds a bunker that looks out on Damascus and to this day can be mobilized in the case of a threat.</p>
<p>After being outside in the heat all day we headed to the Majrasa part of the Jordan River and rafted down it.</p>
<p><strong>July 8</strong></p>
<p>Another early morning. We checked out of the guesthouse and headed to Karmiel to coach a bunch of clinics at a large summer camp. Watching the kids’ faces light up when they catch their first pass or learn how to cradle is well worth it.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_clinic2.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1287" title="lax clinic 2" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_clinic2.jpg" alt="" width="263" height="180" /></a>We played a mock game of lacrosse, where the guys and girls mixed teams and played with modified girls’ rules. Some of the girls we had coached began a cheerleading section, which only egged us on to try moves that were a little silly but got the girls to laugh and smile. After playing some of the kids wanted autographs and hugs, which was a cool feeling.</p>
<p>After coaching we headed to Wingate, an IDF (Israel Defense Force) base. This base is Israel’s National Center for Physical Education and Sport and is the national training center for Israel’s Olympic team. While there we watched a combat solider go through a practice street-clearing drill with a semi-automatic weapon. We then went to the obstacle course that every solider has to pass during basic training. Some of us tried about half of the course but stopped when we were told we had to crawl through the sandy, rocky dirt, because we weren’t in pants.</p>
<p><strong>July 9</strong></p>
<p>Another clinic day, and this time only four or five people went, so the rest of us took advantage of the day and spent it on the beach.</p>
<p><strong>July 10</strong></p>
<p>Woke up to another beautiful day in Tel Aviv, and the girls decided that because it was a Tuesday we were going to head toward the shuk for the artists’ fair. The handmade goods that the artists made were beautiful. I believe everyone bought something as a reminder of this trip to Israel and the experience. After a successful time in the shuk, we went to Netanya to coach another clinic that afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>July 11</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_clinic3.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1294" title="lax clinic 3" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_clinic3.jpg" alt="" width="325" height="275" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_clinic3.jpg 325w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_clinic3-300x253.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 325px) 100vw, 325px" /></a>Early wakeup call to drive to southern Tel Aviv to coach (this is my last clinic in Israel because I fly out at 5:00 am tomorrow).  The kids at this clinic spoke a good amount of English, which made it a little bit easier to coach. One of the girls thought it was funny to run up to us while coaching, tickle us and then run away giggling.</p>
<p>After coaching we all headed down to the beach until we had to get ready for our games later that day in northern Tel Aviv. At the games we had a huge group of people watching us, and there were even a couple of reporters there, which made us all happy because it meant that the sport and the program were gaining recognition in Israel. The men were playing for the Zimmerman Cup for the second year in Israel and the women held an exhibition intrasquad game in between the men’s games.</p>
<p>After everyone finished playing we finished up by celebrating and filming the last bit of footage for our “Call Me Maybe” video. </p>
<p><strong>July 27</strong></p>
<p>I’ve been home for about two weeks now, and I still cannot believe that my time in Europe and Israel has come to an end. Being able to represent a nation that I have always been connected to and being able to teach a sport that I love to children was incredibly fulfilling.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_israelbanner.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1252" title="Israel lacrosse banner" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_israelbanner.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="240" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_israelbanner.jpg 320w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_israelbanner-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /></a>The hope is to continue to build the program from the bottom up in Israel so that the two men’s club teams continue to grow (and more teams are added) and that it becomes a sport that is recognized and played throughout the country. Fingers crossed Israel will have a women’s team representing them in 2013 at the World Cup in Canada and a men’s team representing them in 2014 at the World Championship in Colorado.</p>
<p>The program is still in its infancy and can use all the help it can get. Any and all donations would be greatly appreciated to help build the program and to help grow the sport of lacrosse internationally. Thank you in advance for all of your help to get me to reach my goal of furthering the sport.</p>
<p>Any and all donations can be sent to the below address, and in the notes section of the check please write Jessica Shegoski.</p>

<p><strong>June 22</strong></p>
<p>Today’s the day; time to represent Israel on the international level as a member of the first-ever Israel National Women’s Lacrosse Team. </p>
<p>On the way to Newark Airport my dad missed the exit off of 287 onto the Turnpike, which should have been a red light to me that it would be a long day of travel. We boarded the plane, and once boarding ended, a thunderstorm that had been threatening all day began. What was supposed to be a 6:15pm flight to Amsterdam turned into an 11pm-ish flight. Supposedly a bolt of lightning hit the ground near the plane and took out an electrical mechanism in the belly of the plane. Unfortunately the closest replacement part was at JFK, and that was driven to Newark at rush hour on a Friday night (not the easiest thing to do).</p>
<p>I ended up sleeping the entire plane ride into Amsterdam and arrived mid-morning on June 23.</p>
<p><strong>June 23</strong></p>
<p>Finally arrived in Amsterdam ready to lax it up for the next week or so.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_swag.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1251" title="Isareli lacrosse gear" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_swag.jpg" alt="" width="287" height="372" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_swag.jpg 287w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_swag-231x300.jpg 231w" sizes="(max-width: 287px) 100vw, 287px" /></a>After such terrible luck on my flight into Amsterdam, my luck turned around in the airport. I was waiting for my ride to get to our accommodations (the Amsterdam Bos), and someone walked up to me and asked if I was with Israel Lacrosse because he saw my stick bag. Turns out he was one of the men’s festival team coaches and coaches full time at Kean University in New Jersey, so I didn’t have to wait alone. </p>
<p>A couple minutes later our ride arrived and it was off to the Bos. When I arrived at my cabin none of the other girls were at the campsite (yes we stayed at a campsite, think sleepaway camp but with all adults … see photos for accommodations); some who had arrived earlier in the day had gone into Amsterdam while others were still on their way. I ended up going grocery shopping with some of the guys and hanging around until the other girls showed up.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_camp.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1250" title="campsite" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_camp.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="185" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_camp.jpg 500w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_camp-300x111.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>Once all the girls got back in from town and flights it was time for the best part of the day, getting out swag (hello new stick, uniforms, warmups, etc.). We also did introductions; the team is made up of an amazing group of females.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>June 24</strong></p>
<p>Woke up with Liz and Sarah to a cold and rainy day (not the ideal practice weather but pretty normal for those of us lucky enough to play a spring sport in the Lehigh Valley). After complaining about how much we didn’t want to get wet or cold we all sucked it up, ate breakfast, and met the rest of the team to drive over to the practice fields.</p>
<p>After a solid and yes cold, wet practice the team headed to the men’s game against Norway, then it was back to the Bos, or da Bos as it became termed, to get warm and clean up for the huge program-wide dinner that we had that night.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_israelbanner.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1252" title="Israel lacrosse banner" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_israelbanner.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="240" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_israelbanner.jpg 320w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_israelbanner-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /></a>I cannot begin to describe how amazing it feels to be part of an organization like Israel Lacrosse and to know that we are the pioneers for the many national teams to come. As an organization, we ended up cramming three teams worth of players plus coaches, trainers and supporters into a pub near the practice fields and had a fun dinner.</p>

<p><strong>June 26</strong></p>
<p>Another full day of game play in Amsterdam. The team is gelling really well together. We lost one game today and knowing my luck we did so by only one goal, which only made me think about Muhlenberg and my girls on the team.</p>
<p>Tonight the women’s team went out for a team dinner at one of the local pubs. Some of us ordered dinner like little kids and got chicken nuggets and fries, while others were more adventurous and ordered the special, which was a locally caught fish.</p>

After a great day of lax the team rushed home to da Bos to get showered and be tourists in Amsterdam. After a quick wardrobe change we all drove into Amsterdam together to explore the Anne Frank house (a historic point that was number one on almost every team member’s list).</p>
<p>The physical house and the rooms that the Frank family and their friends lived in were much more spacious then I had imagined. One of the things that I found interesting about the house was that when Otto Frank (Anne’s father) was consulted about turning it into a historical site, he was adamant about not setting the rooms up as they were, so the rooms are empty other than some TV screens running footage of friends and family speaking. There is a small diorama model that shows the setup of the full apartments, though.</p>
<p>After exploring the Anne Frank house the team went into Rembrandt Square to grab food prior to going to the European Premiere of the movie <em>Crooked Arrows</em>.</p>

Luckily for us, we finished out the day and went in placed second for the festival tournament, which basically solidified our place in the championship game the next day.</p>
<p>Since we only had two games we had a lot more free time during the afternoon and at night. After our games, we split into smaller groups, dropped all of our gear in one of the cars and made our way to the bus station. I guess it was our lucky day on the bus because none of us had to pay our fare into Amsterdam. Turns out it was the bus driver’s birthday and he was giving away some free rides, or maybe our team was just too overwhelming ha ha.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_friends.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1256" title="Jessica Sheogski and teammates" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_friends-300x237.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="237" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_friends-300x237.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_friends-379x300.jpg 379w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/07/shegoski_friends.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Our first stop in Amsterdam was food and being that we are the Israeli team, of course, we all walked into a felafel place and satisfied our hunger. Once that was fixed we wandered toward the Palace to check it out. It was a beautiful structure that overlooked a larger central square.</p>
<p>We then wandered our way through a farmer’s/flea market that had beautiful flowers and food of every color. We continued to wander in the direction of the Jewish Quarter in Amsterdam and found the Jewish History Museum and one of the Portuguese synagogues. Then it was off to the famous red light district just to say that we had been there &#8211; it was interesting to say the least.</p>
<p> <strong>June 29</strong></p>
<p>Championship Day!!! Both of Israel’s festival teams were in the championship game today against Global Players. The men’s and women’s championship games were at the same time so unfortunately we couldn’t watch each other and cheer each other on, but it must have worked to the Israel Lacrosse program’s advantage because both teams won their respective tournaments!!</p>
<p>The men’s team won in regulation but we went into overtime. At first the refs told our coaches that there would be no overtime or decision and we would have to share the title (something that neither team wanted). To rectify this we went into a three-minute golden goal overtime, then if no one scored in those three minutes we would go into Braveheart to decide who won. For those of you who don’t know, Braveheart is a full-field one-v-one with goalies in cage.</p>
<p>Lucky for us, after having the ball in our defensive end we won it back and the baby of the team (Felissa) took a beautiful shot that went straight into the back of the net. At first I just stood on the field, not sure how to react (I was in shock), then I started running to the goalie (Liz) tearing up and the entire team ran together to celebrate.</p>

			<p><em>With the spring sports season just about wrapped up, we will be taking a closer look at Muhlenberg’s senior student-athletes.</em></p>
<p><em>We continue with women’s lacrosse. Seniors Kelsey Elmer, Maggie Hare, Sarah Hetrick, Angela Napoletano, Becky Ritter and Jessica Shegoski were honored during a ceremony before the season finale against Ursinus.</em></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/05/elmerhs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1146" title="elmerhs" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/05/elmerhs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Kelsey Elmer</strong></p>
<p><strong>You rank in the top 20 in on the program’s career assists list; what’s your key to finding open teammates? </strong>My role is easy, I just need to make sure my feet are moving and that I get off a good pass. It’s my teammates that make the good cuts and get themselves open so I can get the ball in their sticks, especially this year. I feel that we’ve been able to really get a large majority of our goal off assists, which just adds to the greater feeling of team cohesion. It’s been really fun to be able to make those connections.</p>
<p><strong>What’s the most memorable moment from your lacrosse career? </strong>I think my most memorable moment from my lacrosse career would have to be this year against F&amp;M. We came out so unbelievably strong and everything was clicking so perfectly. We forced them to take a timeout, which was an awesome feeling knowing that they needed to regroup and figure out a new game plan to shut us down. This year, the team has had some of the best cohesion I’ve been a part of, and the first half of that game absolutely exemplified that. It makes it so much fun, too, when you’re just finding each other. It was a great feeling and showed that we can hang with the best.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your most memorable off-the-field moment or accomplishment from your time at Muhlenberg? </strong>My most memorable off-the-field moments were probably my time spent in Spain. Although it wasn’t specifically at Muhlenberg, school gave me the opportunity to spend a semester there. I had an incredible time with priceless experiences. And I have to say that any time off-the-field with everyone on the team is never dull and always full of ridiculousness and fun, which make us that much closer!</p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans? </strong>I am planning on earning some money this summer at home, and then I am looking to move to Denver toward the end of the summer or the beginning of fall. I’ve been looking into working in some different hospitals in Denver, either in clinical research or as a medical aid in a particular department. I’m also considering working at a spine and head trauma rehab center, which would allow me to really delve further into neuroscience. My final option is to just be a ski bum for a little while out there until I get my bearings. I wouldn’t mind that.</p>
<p><strong>What kind of person is Sarah Hetrick? </strong>Sarah is someone who has been working hard for the past four years and is always trying to make herself and her teammates better. She has a lot of versatility in that she can utilize her height in defense while bringing her speed and stick skills to the attack. It has been fun being able to play with her the past four years and watch her develop into a really strong player and good teammate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/05/harehs1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1148" title="harehs" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/05/harehs1.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Maggie Hare</strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s something about you people might be surprised to learn? </strong>I came to Muhlenberg without any concrete idea of what I wanted to major or minor in, and I actually hated my first communications course and first Spanish course that I took here. Despite that, I ended up majoring in media and communication and minoring in Spanish. <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What was it like visiting Spain? </strong>Visiting Spain this past summer was one of the most rewarding and exciting opportunities I’ve had as a student at Muhlenberg. I was equally excited and terrified going off and living in Spain with a group of people from different Lehigh Valley colleges that I’d never met before. I am so happy and lucky that I had the opportunity to go, because the experience really opened my eyes to how different life is in Spain compared to what I’m used to at Muhlenberg or back home in New Jersey. The cultural experience is what will stick with me the most. Once I got past the initial culture shock of life in Sevilla, I really enjoyed learning about the different traditions and customs of the people living there. I think one of the most important rewards I got from going to Spain was that I was really pushed far out of my comfort zone. It really gives you a new perspective on how you think about different cultures and how you see and understand yourself. <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s your most memorable off-the-field moment or accomplishment from your time at Muhlenberg? </strong>In terms of off-the-field lacrosse activities, one memorable moment that stuck with me was when we all went to do volunteer work in Allentown. One of the groups that we worked with was the Sixth Street Shelter. We went there and did some gardening work and anything else we could do to help. We also learned about the shelter and its efforts to help get families back on their feet and eventually able to provide for themselves. The experience was great because my teammates and I had fun working together and working with some of the individuals at the shelter. I think it is important for our team to give back to the community, and it was a very rewarding experience.</p>
<p><strong>What’s it been like getting to play four more years with your high school teammate Jessica Shegoski? </strong>I have actually been playing sports with Jess since we were in elementary school. That being said, playing eight years of lacrosse with her on top of that has been great! I’ve been really lucky to have such an amazing teammate and friend continue through high school and college with me. As an athlete and as an individual, Jess has known me and played with me longer than anyone else at Muhlenberg. Because of that, she has been a major source of encouragement for me on and off the field. I can’t imagine playing lacrosse without Jess. Jess has always been a good friend and has all of those qualities you’d want your teammate to have. She is relentless, encouraging, aggressive, a team player and has incredible sportsmanship (just to name a few). That being said, it’s hard to play any sport with her and not have those qualities rub off on you. Jess is a true role model, and I can’t imagine my lacrosse experience here at Muhlenberg without her.<strong></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/05/hetrickhs1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1154" title="hetrickhs" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/05/hetrickhs1.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Sarah Hetrick</strong></p>
<p><strong>As a midfielder, you’re asked to do a little bit of everything on the field; do you prefer playing offense or defense? </strong>It depends on the day! Coming from playing low attack in high school, I feared the idea of playing defense. But I have developed a love of it over the past few years. There’s nothing like causing a turnover and getting the ball back for your team. The only downside is all of the running!<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Do you have any hidden talents outside of lacrosse? </strong>I don’t know if I would call it a talent, let alone hidden (anyone who knows me knows I love food!), but I’d like to think I’m a pretty good cook.</p>
<p><strong>What’s the best part about playing lacrosse? </strong>The best part about playing lacrosse is that I belong to a team. I like to think of our team as my college family, and I can talk to them about anything, anytime. We are each other’s support system.</p>
<p><strong>What’s the most memorable moment from your lacrosse career? </strong>My most memorable moment was our win over Dickinson freshman year. Going into the game, our freshmen class was well aware of the past results with Dickinson, so when that great win came it was as if we had all won the lottery. We didn’t know what to do with ourselves!</p>
<p><strong>What’s your most memorable off-the-field moment or accomplishment from your time at Muhlenberg? </strong>My most memorable off-the-field accomplishment would have to be making the Dean’s List for the last three semesters &#8230; I finally learned time management!</p>
<p><strong>What made you decide to major in business administration? </strong>I have always dreamed of owning my own restaurant, so majoring in business administration seemed like the right path to get there. While I don’t plan on owning a restaurant any time soon, my major has given me plenty of other opportunities.</p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans? </strong>I am happy to say that I have a job lined up for after I graduate! I’ll be doing a combination of sales and operations for a food ingredient brokerage (yes, food!), and I’ll be traveling up and down the East Coast.</p>
<p><strong>What kind of teammate is Kelsey Elmer? </strong>Kelsey is a fun and easy-going person. As captain, she loves our team and does a great job keeping us focused. On the field, Kelsey is a key attacker with a rapid-fire shot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/05/napoletanohs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1150" title="napoletanohs" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/05/napoletanohs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Angela Napoletano</strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s your role as a team captain? </strong>This year it has been a lot about keeping the team positive — no matter whether we are losing by five or winning by two. The team’s mental attitude makes a big difference, so keeping everyone encouraged has been important.</p>
<p><strong>How big of an accomplishment has it been reaching the 100-point mark in your career? </strong>I was really happy to have been able to reach that mark throughout my four years here. I wasn’t able to finish the season last year, so to be able to finish my final season with 100 points is something I won’t ever forget. <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s the most memorable moment from your lacrosse career?  </strong>I said this in the beginning of the season, but as of now it still stands as my most memorable moment — beating McDaniel by one in overtime freshman year. I don’t think I could ever forget it. <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s your most memorable off-the-field moment or accomplishment from your time at Muhlenberg? </strong>There have been too many memorable off-the-field moments, but something I will never forget is going to Disney World for Spring Break with the team my sophomore year. Alex Franck, Alex Bellini, Kelsey Elmer and I were in a special pirate room far away from everyone else. But going into the parks and going on all of the rides with everyone was so much fun, and I wish we could do it again!</p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans? </strong>I will be going to graduate school in the fall to receive my master’s degree in childhood education. And from there I plan on becoming a teacher at the elementary level.</p>
<p><strong>What’s Becky Ritter like off the field?  </strong>Off the field, Becky is just as feisty as she is on it! She’s a great friend, and she will use her competitive drive to do well wherever life takes her after we graduate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/05/ritterhs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1151" title="ritterhs" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/05/ritterhs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Becky Ritter</strong></p>
<p><strong>How rewarding has it been becoming a full-time starter in your final season? </strong>It’s been extremely rewarding becoming a starter this year. I have worked really hard the past three seasons to improve my skills, and all of my hard work has gotten me to where I am today.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s your favorite part about playing lacrosse? </strong>There are two reasons why I love playing Muhlenberg lacrosse. One reason is that I am extremely competitive, and playing an intercollegiate sport has given me the opportunity to really be competitive. I think my favorite part about playing lacrosse here, though, is playing with everyone on this team. I get an opportunity to play with my best friends every day.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s the key to making a big defensive stop? </strong>The key to making a big defensive stop is having confidence and playing scrappy. You need to have confidence in yourself.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s the most memorable moment from your lacrosse career? </strong>My most memorable moment was beating McDaniel in overtime my sophomore year.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your most memorable off-the-field moment or accomplishment from your time at Muhlenberg? </strong>I have a lot of favorite moments here at Muhlenberg, but I think one of my favorite memories was going to Disney World with the team my sophomore year.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans? </strong>As of right now I don’t have any definite plans, but I am hoping to find something that I really love to do.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What kind of teammate is Angela Napoletano? </strong>Angela is a great teammate. She is so competitive and pushes everyone else to be competitive too. It’s clear that she loves the sport and the team. It’s been a privilege to play with her for an entire four years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/05/shegoskihs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1152" title="shegoskihs" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/05/shegoskihs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Jessica Shegoski</strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s your funniest Muhlenberg lacrosse memory? </strong>My funniest Muhlenberg memory is the opening ceremonies of the women’s lacrosse Olympics my sophomore and senior years. The entire team is split into different nations, and we all dress up in the style of our adopted homeland during the opening ceremonies. <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Do you have any pregame superstitions or traditions? </strong>I make it a point to get to the locker room super early, and I always have to make sure that my hair has some sort of braid in it. This year, the perfect game day hair style has been two French braids into a ponytail braid topped off with the perfect red polka dot ribbon tied in a bow. I also always have my headphones in my ears with my iPod on and music blaring. One of the last songs that I must listen to before getting on the field is “I Can’t Dance” by Genesis. <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s the most memorable moment from your lacrosse career? </strong>The most memorable moment was beating Dickinson my freshman year at Scotty Wood Stadium.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s your most memorable off-the-field moment or accomplishment from your time at Muhlenberg? </strong>My most memorable off-the-field accomplishment at Muhlenberg was being on the resident advisor staff for three years, and serving as the head resident liaison on campus this year.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans? </strong>My future plans are not concrete past July of this summer. In June I will be playing on the Israeli Women’s National Lacrosse Team in the European Championships. Then I will be traveling to Israel with the team to coach camps and clinics in order to spread the sport of lacrosse and hopefully help other girls fall in love with the sport I am passionate about. I am also continuously searching for employment for next year (I had a job interview on April 18, wish me luck).<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s your teammate since high school, Maggie Hare, like off the field? </strong>Maggie and I have known each other since elementary school. I cannot remember a sports season (either soccer or lacrosse) that I have not played with her. I have so many good memories with her both on and off the field, from long car rides to states like Maryland for soccer tournaments to rushing to Rita’s on the first day of spring after high school and college lacrosse practices. I am so glad I got to continue my college career with Maggie. <strong></strong></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/elmerhs.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1072" title="Kelsey Elmer" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/elmerhs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Female Athlete of the Week &#8211; Kelsey Elmer, Lacrosse</strong></p>
<p>Elmer ended her career with a blast, scoring a career-high four goals at Dickinson on Wednesday and topping that with five vs. Ursinus on Saturday. She scored two go-ahead goals in overtime at Dickinson and netted two in a 6-0 run vs. Ursinus that turned a 12-6 deficit into a tie. Elmer scored her nine goals on only 11 shots.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/beckhs1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1073" title="Brian Beck" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/04/beckhs1.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Male Athlete of the Week &#8211; Brian Beck, Baseball</strong></p>
<p>Beck hit .455 with five runs scored and four RBI in a pair of games against Dickinson. He was 3-for-6 with a two-run single and a double in the first game, and he belted a two-run homer, his third of the season, in the second. Beck had an .818 slugging percentage during the week and raised his season average from .326 to .351.</p>

			<p>It’s the middle of April – taxes are due, the Titanic has been down for 100 years, and even though softball and men&#8217;s lacrosse have the weekend off, there’s plenty of Muhlenberg sports action.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-104" title="Mule Marquee Matchup" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="237" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg 350w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1-300x203.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" /></a>Women’s Tennis vs. Washington (Friday, 3:30)</strong></p>
<p>Two teams that made the Centennial Conference playoffs last year are in a scramble to get back. Washington (5-3) and Muhlenberg (3-3) are in the middle of a five-team pack that includes Haverford (6-2), Dickinson (5-2) and Gettysburg (4-3). Those five teams are likely competing for three playoff spots, with Johns Hopkins and Swarthmore setting the pace at 6-0.</p>
<p>The Shorewomen are ranked eighth in the Atlantic South Region but have struggled since losing two of their top four players to injuries. Muhlenberg is coming off its most decisive win of the season, 8-1 against Ursinus.</p>
<p>Washington has won the last four meetings, including one in the 2009 CC playoffs. Last year’s 7-2 match featured many close sets.</p>
<p><strong>Tennis vs. Johns Hopkins (Saturday, 1:00); at McDaniel (Sunday, 12:00)</strong></p>
<p>A busy weekend of tennis for the Mules includes teams at opposite ends of the CC standings. For the women, Johns Hopkins is 6-0 in the CC and ranked eighth in Division III; McDaniel is 0-8 in the CC. For the men, 16th-ranked Hopkins is 6-0 and McDaniel is 0-5. The Muhlenberg men have not lost to McDaniel since 1982.</p>
<p><strong>Baseball vs. Swarthmore (Friday, 3:30); at Gettysburg (Saturday, 12:30 doubleheader)</strong></p>
<p>The Mules will try to halt their five-game skid at home against Swarthmore. Muhlenberg has not lost at home to the Garnet since 1995, extending the streak last year on a walkoff home run. The Mules then travel to Gettysburg, whom they swept last year.</p>

<p>After three straight one-goal losses, the Mules are looking to take out their frustrations against a Bryn Mawr team that has not won a CC game since 2000.</p>

<p>Softball and track and field take the spotlight this weekend.</p>
<p><strong>Softball at McDaniel (Saturday, 1:00)</strong></p>
<p>What makes this the marquee matchup of the weekend? It&#8217;s not just that McDaniel is in first place in the Centennial Conference with an 8-0 record <a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-104" title="Mule Marquee Matchup" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1-300x203.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="203" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1-300x203.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>and Muhlenberg is one of two teams tied for second at 6-2 &#8211; although that certainly is a big part of it.</p>
<p>The two teams have come by their success in extremely different manners. Muhlenberg is hitting .374 and averaging more than nine runs in its eight CC games. Reigning CC player of the week Kelly Kline is hitting .593 with a .963 slugging percentage in CC games .</p>
<p>McDaniel, on the other hand, has done it with pitching, allowing only eight runs in its eight CC games. Reigning CC pitcher of the week Caroline Brehm is 8-0 with a 0.46 ERA and 88 strikeouts in 45.1 innings in CC games.</p>
<p>What will win out, hitting or pitching?</p>

<p><strong>Track &amp; Field hosts Muhlenberg Invitational (Saturday, 10:00)</strong></p>
<p>The Mules welcome 15 other schools for their only home meet of the outdoor season. This meet has been contested in rain and snow in previous years, so the sunshine and mild temperatures should lead to some good performances. Muhlenberg is also sending a handful of runners to Princeton for a distance event Friday night.</p>
<p><strong>Women&#8217;s Lacrosse at McDaniel (Friday, 3:30); Men&#8217;s Lacrosse at McDaniel (Saturday, 1:00)</strong></p>
<p>The Mule lax teams travel to Westminster in search of their first Centennial Conference win of the season. Both teams defeated McDaniel last year, the women 17-6 and the men 8-5. Both Green Terror squads have won just once in the CC.</p>

<p><strong>Baseball at Franklin &amp; Marshall (Saturday, 12:30 doubleheader)</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg has lost four of its last five CC games and will look to get back on the winning track against a Franklin &amp; Marshall team that has split its first three CC series. Four of the Diplomats&#8217; first six CC games ended in shutouts, two each way.</p>

Hopefully, the forecasted rain will not turn this busy schedule into an April Fool.</p>
<p><strong>Softball vs. Washington (Saturday, 1:00); at Gettysburg (Sunday, 1:00)</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-104" title="Mule Marquee Matchup" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1-300x203.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="203" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1-300x203.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mulemarquee1.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Two Centennial Conference playoff teams square off on Saturday in the Mules&#8217; first home CC doubleheader of the 2012 season. Muhlenberg beat Washington, 8-4, in the first game of the playoffs en route to the CC championship last year. The teams split in the regular season. The Shorewomen are off to a 4-0 start in CC play, while the Mules are 2-0.</p>

<p>Gettysburg did not make the CC playoffs last year but is traditionally one of the strongest teams in the league, and one that gives Muhlenberg a hard time. The Mules have never swept the Bullets in a regular-season doubleheader, and they haven&#8217;t won a game at Gettysburg since 2000.</p>

<p>The 16-6 Mules, who received 11 votes in this week&#8217;s D3baseball.com poll, look to continue their winning ways with three CC games and one non-league contest. Coming off Tuesday&#8217;s 11-5 win at Ursinus, Muhlenberg will try to complete its first season sweep of the Bears on Friday.</p>

<p>Saturday&#8217;s twinbill is against a McDaniel team that, like Muhlenberg, has shown great improvement: The Green Terror is 11-4 after winning 12 games all of last season. The Mules, who have scored in double figures in 13 of their 22 games, will try to solve a McDaniel pitching staff that has a sparkling 2.40 ERA.</p>

<p>After evening their CC mark at 2-2 with a dramatic win vs. Franklin &amp; Marshall last night, the Mule women look to make it two in a row against a Washington team that reached the CC championship match last year. The Mule men are looking for their first win of the spring.</p>
<p><strong>Men&#8217;s Golf at McDaniel Spring Invitational (Saturday and Sunday)</strong></p>
<p>The Mules compete in one of their biggest tournaments of the season, with 18 teams scheduled to tee off in the two-day event. Among their opponents will be five other CC teams.</p>
