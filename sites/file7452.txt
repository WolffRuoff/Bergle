								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I found Jim Grooms presentation incredibly eye opening. I had no idea that the government had that much access to our personal information. At first I did not think it was a big deal that they had our information. The reason I thought this was because for safety reasons if I have to give up a certain amount of privacyÂ  it is okay. However when I saw the pizza phone call that is when I completely changed my mind. I found it completely invasive and dangerous that this is the direction we are headed with all of our personal information. Jim Grooms also said how the internet also views you as a series of data points. This means that they do not even care about you as an individual and view you more as a statistic. Following up on this topic advertising companies do the same thing. While you might think you are getting a free social media account they are actually selling all of your information to advertising companies. The assumption is that everything is completely free however you sacrifice your privacy. You are basically exchanging your privacy for free accounts.</p>
<p>Like I mentioned in my previous paragraph I never understood the problem with having people view my information. Now I understand the problem that this could potentially have on us in the future. I would have never have guessed that big social media accounts made their money by selling our information to advertising companies. I find this a complete invasion of privacy. Especially so because some social media accounts give the appearance of your profile being private. For example my status on Instagram is private. I thought this would give me control over who views my information. However, I now know that my information is being sold to advertising companies.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Everyone relies on Google and other search engines for information. And when googling someone so much information comes up about who they are and what they are doing with their lives. But, sometimes the correct person that you are looking for comes up because there is other people out there that could have the same name.</p>
<p>I have actually googled myself multiple times to look up statistics for lacrosse and other things for the recruiting process. So I had a pretty good idea of what was going to come up. As I expected most of what comes up is for lacrosse, different profiles I have created for recruiting and a statistics website that my high school is on and then my Twitter also comes up.</p>
<p>Then when I go to photos there are photos of me, some members of my family, some friends, and then photos of people that I do not know at all. There are several photos that appear from different social medias that I have. Along with photos from social media there are photos from school events that I am in or I was at the event that the photo was taken at if I am not actually in the photo. When I go to the news tab it is just articles for lacrosse and that is it. Then in videos it is also just lacrosse footage. I have never posted anything to YouTube except for my lacrosse highlight tape and I indirectly did that because it is under my name, but my dad actually posted it on there for me.</p>
<p>Nothing comes up that I am ashamed of or do not want being viewed when my name is googled so I think I have done a good job on being cautious on the Internet.</p>
