					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;This is an interesting issue, since it deals with Google global expansion - Here you&#039;re really referring to the battle for control of the distributor power role in China.  This is not necessarily a technology issue, but instead a strategic one to see where web users will direct their search traffic, and which technology companies (that manufacture smartphones and computers in China) will make partnerships with Google to make it the default search engine.  The posts you have written this semester suggest that companies like Google are scrambling to try to expand into as many power roles and international markets as possible - You might think about what this could mean for the future of the Internet and for users of the Internet if Google is able to expand its already dominant position in the world of Web searching.&lt;/p&gt;
