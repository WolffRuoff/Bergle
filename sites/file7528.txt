								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In googling myself, I came across many things that weren&#8217;t me. I typed &#8220;Matthew Stark&#8221; directly into Google using a private window to minimize tracking. I apparently have a Wikipedia page and many Facebook accounts. These are not me because I do not have Facebook and I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m quite famous enough to have a Wikipedia page dedicated solely to me. It might also help that I&#8217;m not a civil rights activist born in 1930.</p>
<p>The amount of content on the page is low but that is to be expected because I doubt anyone googles me/him. Another thing I found that is embarrassing in a way is a doctor of the same name from Oregon. According toÂ <em>Health Grades, Inc.</em> (<a href="https://www.healthgrades.com/provider/matthew-stark-gj2jw">link</a> to page), he&#8217;s rated 1 star. This guy comes up 5th on Google (not including the images section) and, as one customer put it, &#8220;[h]<span>e rushes through the visit, dismisses complaints and obviously doesn&#8217;t understand the importance of patient /Doctor relationships.</span>&#8221; I guess my chances of moving to Oregon are gone.</p>
<p>The amount of entries that aren&#8217;t me is astounding. I couldn&#8217;t find myself because I&#8217;m probably one of the last of the 20.9 million results for my name because I don&#8217;t put anything out there on myself. I probably should get to doing that but I&#8217;m nervous to do so. I don&#8217;t want to end up not getting a job because of one social media blunder like you see in the news. By googling myself, it makes me wonder how Muhlenberg found me, if they did, online.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After searching myself on multiple different search engines, I found very interesting things. When ever I would search myself, the internet would for some reason try to auto correct my name from two l&#8217;s in Hillburn to one l. With my name spelled with one l it turns out the results would come up with a much wider variety of people compared to Hillburns with two l&#8217;s. At the top of all the pages were mainly football related that includes things like my hudl account, videos of football camps I attended and my highlights. What also came up was my twitter profile and tweets I have posted. This really enforces the fact that everything posted online can be seen and makes me think about how careful I have to be with what I post online. Just a few scrolls down comes up a man with a profile about him going to jail and that is something I definitely would not want people to get confused with for me. What also surprised me is that a few years back I searched myself and found that a division one lacrosse player with the same name as me would come up and now I do not see him on the same page as me. This experience was very eye opening and just reinforces the fact that social media can be very dangerous if you do not be careful and can influence peoples opinions on you without even meeting you.</p>
