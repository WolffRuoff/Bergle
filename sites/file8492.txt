								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Look around you, look to your left, to your right, behind you and now back at yourself. Everyone you saw including yourself is a liar, we are all liars. While sitting at the dining hall, on the second floor enjoying my lunch one afternoon I noticed from a birds eye view all the different conversations people were having. I wasn’t eavesdropping, just to clarify but I did hear from up above, “No, that dress doesn’t make you look fat!” I wasn’t going to judge that girl on her response but it led me to wonder why people disguise the truth and how often they do it. I could not get my mind off this subject, thinking to myself how often I might be lied to on any given day and how I might be able to detect it. I went online, quickly flipping through article after article until I found a Ted talk entitled, “How to Spot a Liar” by Pamela Meyer. I was enlightened on what she had to say.</p>
<p>She answered all of the questions that flooded my head earlier that day, providing in depth explanations to the complexities of deception and how deception and lies can impact not only our social lives but our lives on a much bigger scale as well. There are a few elemental facts about lying, one being that it is a collegial action. Not every lie is catastrophic, but there are certainly many willing participants who take part in deception for the sake of their social dignity, i.e.: the case with the dress. These willing participants are the ones who kick start deception to a whole new level. Ones who constantly lie and manipulate may think that their wrong doing will impact only those directly involved but as we have seen in recent history that is not the case. Back in 2010 for example, Bernie Madoff deceived the entire nation single handedly into just under trillions of dollars in debt. It is the unwilling participants who are affected most and lies like these so evidently betray our country by jeopardizing security and undermining our government.</p>
<p>We are all opposed to lying, but frequently do it in so many different ways. What’s astonishing is that you could potentially be lied to up to 200 times in any given day (Meyer). And even worse, strangers lie about 3 times within the first 10 minutes of meeting each other (Meyer). And on top of that, by the time kids reach college they lie to their mom on average 1 out of every 5 interactions !(Meyer). Now that makes me feel like a terrible son. Lies and deception occur everywhere, we encounter unavoidable spam in our emails, fake digital friends on Facebook, identity thieves and Ponzi schemes and it is all because our world is changing faster than we could have ever anticipated. Meyer said “it’s transparent with blogs and social networks broadcasting the buzz of a whole new generation of people that have made a choice to live their lives in public” (Meyer).  We complain about privacy rights and manipulative media but we are the ones deceiving one another. The advanced new world texting and tweeting blind us to the basic subtleties of human decency.</p>
<p>Take another look around the room, the people and yourself deserve an honorable society where truth can be heightened and promoted and one where deception is publicized.</p>
