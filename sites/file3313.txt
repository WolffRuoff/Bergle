								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For those of you who read my blog, my hilarious commentary and thrilling accounts of everyday life likely overshadow a common point of curiosity: What do I sound like?</p>
<p>Well, you&#8217;ve heard me sing (if you dig back far enough in the blog, that is) and you&#8217;ve seen my precious mug plenty, but if you missed our accepted student&#8217;s day, you&#8217;re just starting to look at muhlenberg, or you&#8217;re just dying to know what my speaking voice is like, you should watch the video below!</p>
<p>In all seriousness, it was an awesome opportunity to be the keynote speaker for our accepted students day and I wanted to share all the positive and encouraging words I had for the 1000 odd hopeful faces in the crowd that day, so give a listen!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Oh my!?</p>
<p>Happy almost March everyone! I know, hard to believe that February is almost over, isn&#8217;t it? Muhlenberg&#8217;s spring break is approaching at the end of this week, and I think a lot of us are feeling pretty ready for the break. I haven&#8217;t been back home since the semester began, so this should be a nice rest period. Of course, first I&#8217;ll have to get through my biochemistry exam.</p>

<p>Speaking of time flying by, the seniors just received this baby in our mail&#8230;</p>

<p>One one hand, yikes! My time here is coming to an end so quickly! On the other, at least I am graduating, and with honors no less!</p>
<p>In other news, Muhlenberg was recently subject to the &#8220;snowpocalypse&#8221; I talked about a little in my previous post. It affected all parts of campus, including sealing everyone&#8217;s cars into an icy tomb. That can get tricky when you need someone to drive you to the airport for a graduate school interview so&#8230;</p>
<div id="attachment_2774" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/02/photo-12-e1393430782238.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2774" class="size-large wp-image-2774" alt="Paul declares victory" src="http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/02/photo-12-e1393430782238-768x1024.jpg" width="640" height="853" srcset="http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/02/photo-12-e1393430782238-768x1024.jpg 768w, http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/02/photo-12-e1393430782238-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2774" class="wp-caption-text">Paul declares victory</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, that is a hammer and pot his is holding. Yes that&#8217;s how we dug Radhika&#8217;s car out of 3 feet of snow. We also used two broken shovels and a big stick.</p>
<p>In regards to the show I mentioned being a part of in my last post (You know the power, gender, theater circus?): we, the cast, have finally settled down on our actual parts which had been the topic of much deliberation for the first week and a half of rehearsal. I will be playing the role of the hypno master, which will be all kinds of fun. I&#8217;ve been reading up on hypnotism and trances and all that for the role (probably when I should have been doing my Asian Traditions thesis, whoops), and I&#8217;m definitely excited to work with the character to make him come alive!</p>
<p>Sort of a side note: if any of you guys out there are readers of Seventeen magazine you might recognize one of my dear friends, Ray, from her full page shot in the second most recent issue (or maybe third. Confession: I&#8217;m not an avid Seventeen reader)</p>
<div id="attachment_2775" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/02/photo-51.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2775" class="size-large wp-image-2775" alt="She would like the world to know that she is basically Tyra Banks now. " src="http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/02/photo-51-1024x1024.jpg" width="640" height="640" srcset="http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/02/photo-51-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/02/photo-51-150x150.jpg 150w, http://admissions.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2014/02/photo-51-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2775" class="wp-caption-text">She would like the world to know that she is basically Tyra Banks now.</p></div>
<p>So you know, Muhlenberg students, shakin&#8217; and movin&#8217;, going places, being in things, life goes on.</p>
<p>Last matter on my mind is accepted students day. For any of you out there who will be in attendance at the event, you&#8217;ll be happy to know that I will be entrancing you with my dulcet tones as I deliver a speech. A graduating senior always speaks at the event, and I am honored to have been selected to welcome you all to our campus and to share my experience with you. (Although if you&#8217;ve perused my blog you may be hearing a fairly familiar story.) I hope to see you all there, and hopefully, I&#8217;ll be able to update more frequently so that there isn&#8217;t a whole jumble of hoopla and hoopti and hoopdo in one post. Until then, remain in suspense with bated breath.</p>
