<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://echoesblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/grammy-logo-gold.jpg" alt="" width="140" height="178" />In a long-overdue decision, the <a href="http://www.grammy.org/recording-academy">Recording Academy</a> recently announced that it would consider video game music for <a href="http://www.grammy.com/">Grammy Awards</a>. Although video games won’t have their own category (yet), they’ll be included in a general category encompassing “Music for Visual Media.” Nobody in the general public cares about this, of course, but the interesting question is whether they should.</p>
<p><span id="more-1109"></span></p>
<p>It’s tempting to compare the Grammy Awards to MTV—sad stories of once-powerful facilitators that got an ear-boxing from cable and the Internet—but the power of the Grammy Awards to effectively promote music even during the network era is questionable. The event has always been a self-congratulatory party for an inside group of music industry people, and during a time when media choices were more limited, the public mainly just enjoyed basking in the pomp and circumstance of the networks’ glitzy coverage. In fact, a better analogy for the Grammys would be to an Independence Day parade, a once-family friendly event today attended mostly by old war vets as the younger crowd plugs into yet another interactive media platform.</p>
<p>The reality, however, is that the Grammy Awards aren&#8217;t really trying to facilitate interaction with that increasingly disinterested TV-viewing public. It’s aimed at those industry insiders, and that’s what makes the inclusion of video game music into the award categories so important. The Recording Academy may not have much direct power over audiences, but by facilitating interactions between industry creators and producers, it helps to determine what those audiences eventually hear online, in stores, and on the radio. Now it may help to determine what video gamers, probably the least likely subgroup of Americans to care about the Grammys, hear when they log into <em><a href="http://us.battle.net/wow/en/">World of Warcraft</a></em>.</p>
<p>The new rules formalize linking pin activities between the record companies and the video game industry that have been growing with the video game industry itself. Popular titles like <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> routinely license popular rock and heavy-metal songs that fit well within their violent and iconoclastic gaming environment. Now, as new game consoles like Wii <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/tech/gaming/2007-05-24-wii_N.htm">offer games for a wide variety of audience categories</a>—fitness games for kids and older adults, chess games for math prodigies—that expand video games far beyond their traditional teenage-male cult, the record companies are starting to work with the gaming companies to exploit all the new distribution and exhibition possibilities.</p>
<p>Why wouldn’t Sony, for example, create music just for a new video game aimed at a particular age group or gender? These days, online and console games probably have a larger audience than MTV or VH1, and they have the ability to reach at least as specialized an audience as a cable television network. Cross-platform releases that include video games, radio, and television will probably become increasingly common. It probably won’t be long before the major media conglomerates own most of the video game production firms as they seek to streamline production, distribution, and exhibition of music and other mass media materials.</p>
<p>Public advocates within the music and video game industries have wanted the Grammys to recognize video game music for years, especially since some Grammy-winning songs that eventually enjoyed popular release originated within video games. Traditional video gamers, however, should be very afraid. This is exactly what happened when <a href="http://www.viacom.com/Pages/default.aspx">Viacom</a> invaded MTV, and we all saw the results. Now that the Recording Academy is sticking its fingers into video games, the core teenage-male cult may start to witness even more commercialization and homogenization of the music in their once-underground medium. Video game music creators, once somewhat separate from the mainstream music industry and free to experiment in a way unknown at most of the modern corporate record labels, may now be pressured to tow the labels’ line.</p>
<p>Only time will tell how the relationship between the labels and the video game companies will develop. However, if the conglomerates’ past record with new media is any indication, the idiosyncratic array of music in many video games today may soon become an artifact of history.</p>

(2011, February 25). Reporters, publicists play game year-round. <em>Variety</em>. Retrieved from <a href="http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118032485?refcatid=1985">http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118032485?refcatid=1985</a>.</p>
<p>A new development in the relationship between Hollywood publicists and news journalists has heightened to a new level, regardless of the time of year. Publicists and news journalists often have agendas of different sorts; while publicists want to promote positive images of their clients, news journalists are constantly trying to find new stories, no matter what type of light is shed on the subjects of the investigation. In years prior, however, Hollywood publicists and entertainment journalists&#8217; goals would often converge during awards season. In the period of time from October to late February, in which all eyes and ears are focused on the &#8220;awards-season beast,&#8221; publicists and reporters often came to an unspoken agreement featuring &#8220;exclusives and firsts taking a backseat to smarter analysis and better access.&#8221; According to several of Hollywood&#8217;s leading publicity honchos, however, this temporary standstill in the conflicting interests of the two groups no longer exists. Reporting on important film news related to the awards race during the actual season is now commonplace. An example of this occurred last year, when news stories regarding <em>The Hurt Locker</em> producer Nicolas Chartier being banned from attending the awards as a result of an email blasting <em>Avatar</em> quickly circulated throughout the industry in the runup to the Oscars.<span id="more-916"></span></p>
<p>The advent of online technology and the role it has played in journalism has played an enormous role in the development of this year-long news cycle. According to Steve Elzer, senior VP of media relations at Sony Pictures Entertainment, &#8220;there is no question that the proliferation of blogs and online journalism has put enormous new pressure on publicists and journals alike.&#8221; Bloggers and online journalists&#8217; sole goal is often to report on the events of the industry, and the advent of social networking websites like Twitter makes it quite easy to keep up with current events of the entertainment world on a minute-by-minute basis. Because of the constant access to the industry&#8217;s developments, publicists and journalists must now both be on guard and vigilant in their pursuits throughout the calendar year, no longer having a break during the so-called &#8220;awards season.&#8221; This change in the publicity &#8220;game&#8221; within the film industry is reflective of the demands of mainstream society as a whole. As more and more technologies come to the forefront, the demand for the newest information at any time and in multiple capacities has increased exponentially.</p>
<p>In terms of power roles, journalists and publicists both fit into the &#8220;facilitator&#8221; role. Publicists are facilitators of the promotion of their clients&#8217; images both to the public and the industry itself. Journalists can be considered facilitators, as well, because they must relay information about newsworthy material to the public. There is often a substantial divide between the goals of publicists and journalists, especially in the film industry, as both groups are facilitators but attempting to facilitate entirely different types of information. According to Stan Rosenfield, a personal publicist who has handled Oscar campaigns for clients such as George Clooney and Helen Mirren, &#8220;journalists want certain stories from us, and when they don&#8217;t get (them), they are not happy with us. But if you want to be good at what you do, you need to have a meaningful relationship with the press.&#8221; When two separate entities like publicists and journalists, who play the same power role have conflicting interests but often have to work together, a &#8220;co-dependency&#8221; often emerges in the film industry. As the Oscar season continues, this relationship is often necessary in order to establish the facilitation efforts of both parties.</p>
