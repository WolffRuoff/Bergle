			<p>Bus rides home have been pretty enjoyable for the Muhlenberg men’s and women’s basketball teams. Of course when both teams win as much as they have this season, just about everything feels better.</p>
<p>Thanks to two of the best starts in program history, the Mules find themselves in some pretty select company when it comes to wins and losses. At the beginning of the week, Muhlenberg was one of just three programs in Division III (out of roughly 400) to have both teams combine for two or fewer losses.</p>
<div id="attachment_688" style="width: 392px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/01/celebration.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-688" class=" wp-image-688  " title="celebration" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/01/celebration.jpg" alt="" width="382" height="317" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/01/celebration.jpg 382w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/01/celebration-300x248.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/01/celebration-361x300.jpg 361w" sizes="(max-width: 382px) 100vw, 382px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-688" class="wp-caption-text">The women&#39;s team cheers in the background following the men&#39;s game-winning shot at Moravian.</p></div>
<p>And even though the men’s squad (9-3) fell last night, it is still off to its best start since 2002. Muhlenberg is one of just 10 programs in the country that has suffered no more than three combined losses.</p>
<p>The hot starts have created an infectious culture of winning, which according to senior Kathleen Naddaff has helped both squads feed off of each other’s success.</p>
<p>“We hang out a lot, so we always love to see the men’s team win,” she said. “We cheer them on, and seeing them win makes us want to go out and win even more. It’s really cool to see Muhlenberg basketball, as a whole, ranking up there with some of the best in the country.”</p>
<p>A key to the success has been their prolific offenses. Entering the week, Muhlenberg was one of just six schools in the NCAA, regardless of division (roughly 1,000 schools), to have both teams averaging more than 80 points per game.</p>
<p>The women (11-0), who rank second in Division III in scoring through Sunday’s games, have used their high-scoring ways to rank third in the country in scoring margin (24.1 points per game). The men, meanwhile, check in at No. 40 (12.1 points per game).</p>
<p>Aside from being friends off the court, the two teams are some of each other&#8217;s biggest fans.</p>
<p>During doubleheaders, the men’s squad is there supporting the women’s team. And when the men take the floor, the women’s team is in the stands cheering them on.</p>
<p>According to Liddic, seeing the women win helps get the winning juices flowing for the men’s team.</p>
<p>“It’s always great to see them get a big win,” Liddic said. “That kind of pumps us up and makes us want to go out and get one too. We hang out a lot both on game days and outside of basketball, and I think we definitely feed off of each other.”</p>
<p>One very noticeable difference this season has been the liveliness of the post-game bus rides.</p>
<p>When the teams split on the road, one squad is in the mood to celebrate while the other is dealing with a loss. But when the Mules sweep a doubleheader, like they did at McDaniel on Saturday, the trips home seem to pass by much more quickly and are a lot more fun.</p>
<p>That joyous feeling is one that both teams hope to experience a lot more as the conference season heats up. And if the two teams keep playing at a high level, Naddaff said there&#8217;s no reason why it can&#8217;t continue beyond the regular season.</p>
<p>“We like to joke around and have fun on the bus,” she said. “And when we both win, you can definitely tell it’s a little louder and everybody’s happy. We’re both off to pretty good starts, and hopefully we can keep it up and get both teams into the postseason.”</p>

			<p>It has become an annual tradition for the Muhlenberg women’s basketball team to attend a Broadway play during Winter Break. For unlike the rest of the students, our team is already back on campus working on becoming better basketball players. We are currently 2-0 in the New Year and 11-0 overall.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/01/wbbmemphis.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-681" title="women's basketball at Memphis" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/01/wbbmemphis.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="432" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/01/wbbmemphis.jpg 350w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/01/wbbmemphis-243x300.jpg 243w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" /></a>On Sunday, however, we took a nice break and headed into New York City to enjoy a fun day together, no basketball involved. Our team is very close and we look forward to having the opportunity to spend time together for this fun event each year. This year we decided to see the show <em>Memphis</em>, which won the Tony Award for Best Musical in 2010. Also, the music incorporated in the production is by Bon Jovi member David Bryan.</p>
<p>The story is about the prominence of segregation in the city of Memphis during the 1950s, specifically in the music scene. A white radio DJ named Huey Calhoun longs to show the rest of the white people in Memphis how great the underground African-American music scene is. During that process, he falls for a black club singer but must keep it out of the public eye because interracial relationships were berated by all during that time period. But Huey does not care what anyone else thinks, for he knows that he is morally right in seeking equality and acceptance for African-Americans.</p>
<p>Even though some of us (ok, maybe just me) were not exactly thrilled that <em>Memphis</em> began before the Giants game was over, we definitely enjoyed ourselves. The music was soulful and upbeat and the singers/dancers were incredibly talented. The performers on stage proved that hard work pays off, which is a positive reminder of how important it is for our team to continue striving to get better. We cannot settle for being a good basketball team, we have to push each other every day in practice to be great.</p>
<p>And although perfection is certainly unattainable, a perfect record is not. But in order to keep us at zero losses, we have to play our hardest every day because a great team doesn’t take days off (unless it’s to attend a Broadway play of course). Yet we did get a fair amount of exercise walking the streets of Manhattan prior to the show starting, and we deserve to have a little fun, right?</p>

			<p>For the first week of 2012, we not only have athletes of the week, but also plays of the week.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/01/clawsonhs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-661" title="Kate Clawson" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/01/clawsonhs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Female Athlete of the Week &#8211; Kate Clawson, Basketball</strong></p>
<p>Clawson scored 30 points on 68.8 percent shooting from the field and pulled down 10 rebounds in a pair of wins for the Mules. She tied for the team lead with nine points against Dickinson, then poured in a career-high 21 &#8211; including Muhlenberg&#8217;s last seven of the game &#8211; at McDaniel.</p>
<p><strong>Female Play of the Week &#8211; Alexandra Chili&#8217;s pass</strong></p>
<p>Late in the first half against McDaniel, Chili threw a behind-the-back pass in stride to Alita Zabrecky for a fastbreak layup that drew oohs and aahs from the crowd. <a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/01/chili_mcd.wmv">Click here to watch video of the play.</a></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/01/liddichs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-662" title="Spencer Liddic" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/01/liddichs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Male Athlete of the Week &#8211; Spencer Liddic, Basketball</strong></p>
<p>Liddic had game highs of 25 points and 11 rebounds to lead Muhlenberg to a 71-70 win at McDaniel in its first game of 2012. Liddic was 10-of-14 from the field and scored 16 points in the second half, including eight in the last 5:30 as the Mules overcame a 10-point deficit. His jumper kicked off a game-ending 10-1 run in the last two minutes, and his rebound of a missed free throw started the possession that ended with the winning points.</p>
<p><strong>Male Play of the Week &#8211; Matt O&#8217;Hara&#8217;s pass</strong></p>
<p>With the Mules scrambling to catch up in the final minute, O&#8217;Hara gathered a tipped offensive rebound, took a quick shot, then hustled after the rebound and touched a pass to Malique Killing in the corner. Killing drained a three to make the score 70-69 with 28 seconds left. <a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2012/01/ohara_mcd.wmv">Click here to watch video of the play.</a></p>

			<p><em>A two-week break in the middle, no standing outside in cold or snow or rain, and &#8211; oh yeah &#8211; a terrific start to the basketball season. What&#8217;s not to like about the winter sports season? </em></p>
<p><em>Muhlenberg assistant athletic trainer and resident poet Lindsay Weiss pays tribute to the winter sports (which start up again on January 4) with this ode. Happy Holidays!</em></p>
<p>It&#8217;s the most wonderful time of the year<br />
With the Mules athletes yelling<br />
And everyone telling you &#8220;Win with no fear&#8221;<br />
It&#8217;s the most wonderful time of the year</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the hap-happiest season of all<br />
With those track and field greetings and wrestling meetings<br />
And ballers so tall<br />
It&#8217;s the hap-happiest season of all</p>
<p>There&#8217;ll be Blue Jays for hosting<br />
Green Terrors for roasting<br />
And Diplomats shooting free throws<br />
There&#8217;ll be scary Bullet stories<br />
And tales of the glories of<br />
Conference play long, long ago</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the most wonderful time of the year<br />
There&#8217;ll be much points a scoring<br />
And takedowns not boring<br />
When ‘Berg fans are near<br />
It&#8217;s the most wonderful time of the year</p>
<p>There&#8217;ll be cool dunks for boasting<br />
Timed races for coasting<br />

There&#8217;ll be win pinning stories<br />
And high jumping glories of<br />
Conference play long, long ago</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the most wonderful time of the year<br />
There&#8217;ll be spectators coming<br />
For plays that are stunning<br />
When ‘Berg fans are near<br />
It&#8217;s the most wonderful time<br />
It&#8217;s the most wonderful time<br />
It&#8217;s the most wonderful time<br />

			<p><em><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/12/kellyhs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-646" title="Julie Kelly" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/12/kellyhs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Junior Julie Kelly of the women&#8217;s basketball team writes about the Mules&#8217; style of mass substitutions and pressure defense and how it has helped them win their first nine games.</em></p>
<p>“Colleen, you’re the one. Julie, you’re the two. Kim, you’re the three. Erin, you’re the four. Katy, you’re the five. At the 17-minute mark, go!”</p>
<p>As the season has progressed, the Muhlenberg women’s basketball team has become accustomed to hearing Coach Ron Rohn emphatically calling for a hockey-style “line change” at different points during the game. “The System,” as it is called, is a way of rotating players in for short spans at a time &#8211; five in and five out. Since we know we won’t be in for very long, we are encouraged to go all out and work our butts off by trapping all over the court and pushing the ball after the other team turns it over. The goal is to wear the other team down by utilizing our conditioning and deep bench.</p>
<p>Having 18 girls on a team is, at first glance, completely overwhelming. However, “The System” is a way for all players to be involved, even if it means only for two minutes in the first half. I can guarantee that if you are working as hard as Coach Rohn wants you to be, you will be winded after that small amount of time anyway.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/12/wbbtrap.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-647" title="trapping defense" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/12/wbbtrap.jpg" alt="" width="390" height="309" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/12/wbbtrap.jpg 390w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/12/wbbtrap-300x237.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/12/wbbtrap-378x300.jpg 378w" sizes="(max-width: 390px) 100vw, 390px" /></a>Sometimes we play fullcourt man-to-man defense, and we must pressure the other team all the way down the court to the other end. Other times we run all over the court trying to trap, tip passes and shoot the gap to get steals. Coach finds it crucial to put in people with fresh legs in this style of play so that they are prepared to exert the effort it takes to be successful.</p>
<p>And though it can be a bit hectic, playing this type of basketball has proven to be effective thus far, for our team is undefeated heading into Winter Break. In addition, we are averaging over 80 points a game, as is the men’s team.</p>
<p>Now that we are all home in our different states, we have two weeks to relax and spend time with our families. When we get back on January 1st, however, it’s back to working hard to get better as a team. We know what we want to accomplish this season: win the conference, make a run in the NCAA Tournament, and hopefully do as well as we did there last year, even better.</p>
<p>But until it is time to get back to practicing daily, we’ll be eating Christmas cookies and enjoying time with our families, sneaking in a run here and there. It truly is “the most wonderful time of the year.” And ending 2011 an undefeated team, makes it that much more exciting for the New Year of basketball to begin.</p>

			<p><em>&#8220;I can&#8217;t believe I am already done with my first semester here at Muhlenberg. It seems like it was just yesterday that I was being moved into my dorm room &#8230;&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Time flies, especially when you are a busy college student-athlete. We asked several Muhlenberg freshman athletes, all of whom completed or are currently in the middle of their seasons, to write about their first-semester experiences and how they were able to adjust academically, athletically and socially. Here&#8217;s what they had to say:</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/12/dosshs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-641" title="Becca Doss" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/12/dosshs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Becca Doss, Cross Country</strong></p>
<p>Joining a team was an adjustment in itself. I went from being a top runner with the same girls for six years to being at the back of the pack on a completely new team.</p>
<p>Despite this, the team definitely made the whole college adjustment nice and smooth. The upperclassmen have been really great about showing us freshmen the wonders of Muhlenberg (like the fro-yo machine, good study spots, the cross country house, etc.). It amazes me how quickly we have become so close.</p>
<p>The commitment has really helped me with time management and keeping an academic focus. It was hard at first to see people getting ready to go out Friday nights while I stayed in to do homework. But I also chilled with teammates and it was all right because we were all in it together.</p>
<p>Even after that and after waking up early every Saturday morning, our performances were worth the sacrifices. We work really hard and have a lot of fun and are always there for each other. I wouldn’t trade the experience for anything.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/12/fiorettihs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-636" title="Krissy Fioretti" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/12/fiorettihs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Krissy Fioretti, Women&#8217;s Soccer</strong></p>
<p>When I got to school, the only thing I knew for sure was that preseason was going to be really challenging and really hot. I got recruited by other schools, but not Muhlenberg, so I didn’t know if I was even going to make the team. I didn’t really know what to expect, but I knew it would be a lot different from high school. I almost didn’t play because I was so nervous I wouldn’t like it.</p>
<p>About two weeks in, I knew I made the right choice. I love everyone on the team and am so glad I got to meet them all. We have great team chemistry led by the best captains and I couldn’t have asked to be on a better team for my first season.</p>
<p>The biggest adjustment was definitely the speed of play. I learned right away that I would have to work really hard to get used to playing at such a fast pace for the entire game. I was very excited to find out I would start on defense in the first game and for the whole season. This surprised me a lot but made me work even harder throughout the season and continue to work hard now that season is over.</p>
<p>The change to college academics was a lot less difficult than I anticipated. I have always had to balance sports and school, so it was exactly what I was used to, and my high school did a great job preparing me for college classes. I knew what to expect in them and how to organize all the work I received so I could get it done in a reasonable amount of time.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/12/gimbarhs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-638" title="Ian Gimbar" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/12/gimbarhs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Ian Gimbar, Football</strong></p>
<p>There was a huge adjustment I needed to make in terms of my academic workload. Having a busy schedule during the season actually helped me out a lot because it forced me to get as much as I could done in the time I had.</p>
<p>With football, I was very grateful to have gotten a large amount of playing time as a freshman. I had expectations of just getting on the field any way possible, but as I moved up the depth chart and some opportunities opened up, I got a chance to see some significant playing time.</p>
<p>The game is much faster and bigger than it was in high school, but in the end, it is still just football.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/12/lesherhs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-639" title="Emily Lesher" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/12/lesherhs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Emily Lesher, Women&#8217;s Basketball</strong></p>
<p>It took me a week or two in the beginning of the semester to adjust to the whole &#8220;college lifestyle.&#8221; For me, the two biggest adjustments were not seeing my family every day and learning how to budget my time so I could get all of my work done. I am very close with my family back at home, so it was challenging for me to adjust to not seeing or talking with them every day.</p>
<p>However, my initial homesickness was eased when I realized that I have &#8220;family&#8221; here: my team. I met all of the other freshman on the team the first day I got here and we instantly started to bond. We became close friends with each other really quickly and supported each other as we all transitioned to life here in Allentown. The upperclassmen on the team also did an amazing job helping us freshmen feel at home &#8230; The team definitely made my transition to college life a million times easier, because they were kind of like a &#8220;built-in&#8221; support system and group of friends.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t played a lot this year, which is difficult (I mean, doesn&#8217;t everyone want to get into games?); however, just being part of the team is amazing. Being able to play with the girls every day at practice is an honor and even if I don&#8217;t get in all that much in the games, I still really enjoy being able to support and cheer everyone on with the other girls on the team.</p>
<p>I have loved my time spent here at Muhlenberg so far, and I am excited for what the second semester has in store for me personally, and for our team!</p>

<p>My first semester of freshman year was one of the most enjoyable experiences I have ever had. Beginning college was a mixture of many different things; it was exciting, but especially nerve-wracking. I was scared to live away from home, make new friends and play on a brand-new team. </p>
<p>All my fears quickly faded. The girls on my team quickly became some of my best friends, and I adjusted to the college lifestyle quicker than I thought I would with the help of my teammates. Balancing playing on the team and my schoolwork was definitely hard, but it is all about time management and setting your priorities.</p>
<p>It has been an amazing experience playing on a team with these girls, and I’ve learned more about the game of basketball than I have learned my whole life. Even though I do not play as much as some of the other girls on my team, I am honored to be part of the team.  The team is a family and we want all of our team to be successful more than anything else. </p>
<p>The bond we all share with each other is something special, and something I am looking forward to see getting stronger as I spend the next four years of my life as part of the Muhlenberg basketball program.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/12/touheyhs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-637" title="Colleen Touhey" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/12/touheyhs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Colleen Touhey, Women&#8217;s Soccer</strong></p>
<p>First semester was awesome! In the beginning it was very difficult adjusting to playing soccer while also balancing my schoolwork. The academics and athletics are more demanding then they were in high school, but once you get into a routine, it is totally manageable!</p>
<p>Having a team that is basically your family makes it worth every minute. There is always someone on the team willing to help you out with school, sports, or whatever it is that you are struggling with.</p>
<p>I got a lot more playing time than I expected to get this season. It was hard to jump right from high school soccer into college soccer. College games move at a much faster pace and are more physical. The upperclassmen on the team were great at getting me ready to compete in this new playing environment. Each game made me more and more confident. By the end of the season I didn&#8217;t feel like a freshmen stepping out onto the field.</p>
<p>Overall, it has been a great experience!</p>

			<p>Both basketball teams returned from finals to pick up wins in their 2011 finales over the weekend. Here are the top plays from thise games.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/12/naddaffhs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-628" title="Kathleen Naddaff" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/12/naddaffhs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Female Play of the Week – Kathleen Naddaff plays point guard</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg already has four very good point guards, but Kathleen Naddaff looked like she was auditioning for the position early in the second half against Albright. After blocking a shot, the 6-1 starting center grabbed the ball and led the fast break, dribbling down the middle of the court and delivering a perfect bounce pass to Alita Zabrecky on her left for a layup.</p>
<p>The basket gave undefeated Muhlenberg a 48-24 lead en route to an 80-47 win.</p>
<p><a title="Kathleen Naddaff assist" href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/12/naddaff_pg.wmv">Click here to watch video of the play. </a></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/12/forsmanhs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-629" title="Hunter Forsman" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/12/forsmanhs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Male Play of the Week &#8211; Hunter Forsman&#8217;s dunk</strong></p>
<p>Forsman finished with style during a game-turning run in the Mules&#8217; 83-78 win against Drew, converting a pass from Spencer Liddic into an emphatic dunk with 9:35 left in the second half.</p>
<p>The field goal was the second straight for Forsman, who scored on a putback on Muhlenberg&#8217;s previous possession. Those were his only two field goals of the game, but they kicked off a 14-0 run that turned a seven-point deficit into a seven-point lead. Forsman had four of his five points and four of his nine rebounds in the run.</p>

			<p><em>Today is the last day of the 2011 Division III football season &#8230; and this is the last round of senior profiles from the Muhlenberg football players, featuring the four senior captains.</em></p>
<p><em>Here are links to the previous profiles: <a title="Senior Profiles: Football, Part 1 of 4" href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/2011/12/13/senior-profiles-football-part-1-of-4/">Part 1</a>, <a title="Senior Profiles: Football, Part 2 of 4" href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/2011/12/14/senior-profiles-football-part-2-of-4/">Part 2</a> and <a title="Senior Profiles: Football, Part 3 of 4" href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/2011/12/15/senior-profiles-football-part-3-of-4/">Part 3</a></em></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/12/hartzellhs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-621" title="Chris Hartzell" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/12/hartzellhs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Chris Hartzell</strong></p>
<p><strong>Is there any particular play from your career that stands out to you? </strong>The biggest play that stands out to me was against Moravian my freshman year. We were down seven, and I was on the field for punt rush. I blocked the punt and ended up with the ball in my hands. I took it to the house to score my first collegiate touchdown. Interestingly, that was the same way I scored my first touchdown in high school.</p>
<p><strong>How would you describe yourself as a player? </strong>I feel I have a good nose for the ball when the quarterback is passing. I’ve gotten a lot better over the years at reading receivers and quarterbacks. I work hard at getting better every day that I’m out on the field, and I love every moment of it.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans? </strong>I plan to start off working at a financial group or bank to learn the ropes, but ultimately I would like to be a financial advisor running my own business.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>You went to high school just a few miles away from Patrick McDonough; what’s it been like playing with a fellow Berks County native? </strong>It’s nice having Pat as a fellow Berks County native because I have someone to back me up when all the New Jersey players say we all live in the middle of nowhere and are a bunch of hicks, which is not true in our case. Pat is, without a doubt, the hardest-working player on our team and a great leader. He is not scared to share his opinion and makes everyone around him a better player, whether it’s by helping them with plays, lifting in the weight room or getting people to watch film. He is an animal on the field and the hardest hitter I’ve ever seen in person. I’m glad he came back for his seventh year of college so the team, and I, could get a chance to play with him for one more year.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mcdonoughhs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-208" title="Patrick McDonough" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/mcdonoughhs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Patrick McDonough</strong></p>
<p><strong>How much of an honor was it to be named the conference’s defensive player of the year and an All-American last season? </strong>It was a great honor being named defensive player of the year and an All-American. But a lot of it had to do with the help of my teammates and coaches on and off the field. <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Why did you transfer to Muhlenberg? What made you decide to come back for your fifth year? </strong>I transferred to Muhlenberg because I was not enjoying playing football at VMI. I also wanted to play against two of my good friends from Wyomissing, Pa., Gregory Lord, who played at Dickinson, and Andrew Kase, who played at Johns Hopkins. Coming back for a fifth year is something not many players get to experience. You understand the game much better and play with more confidence. You only get so long to play a sport like this, and I figured why not take the opportunity to play another year and look for jobs when I graduate in December.</p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans? </strong>My future plans are to finally graduate college in December. Throughout this semester I have been applying for jobs all over the Northeast. So I plan to have a job in sales or finance by the time I graduate.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>What kind of teammate is Chris Hartzell?</strong> Playing with Chris Hartzell has been awesome. He is one of the hardest workers on the team and plays at an extremely high level that sets the standard on our team. Although I wonder how he plays so well when his diet consists of Airheads, Cinnamon Toast Crunch and Oreos. I don’t know how he does it, but whatever floats his boat.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/12/musickphs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-623" title="Phil Musick" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/12/musickphs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Phil Musick</strong></p>
<p><strong>What it’s like having a twin, especially one who is on the same team? </strong>Having a twin brother is really cool, especially since we get to practice against each other every day. Having Matt go to the same college as me was a huge advantage because it made the transition to college and college football much easier and more comfortable. It has also been very beneficial because when we are home for the summer and winter breaks, we push each other in our offseason training and practice drills together. Those drills can get heated at times, but having someone to train with is a huge advantage.</p>
<p><strong>How have you improved since your freshman year? </strong>I have improved in a lot of aspects of the game. I have become a much smarter player. After coming from a very simple offense in high school, the playbook here was much harder to learn. It took me awhile, but I was able to catch on, and now I can adjust quickly on the field. I also like to think my athleticism has improved, although moving from the defensive line to the offensive line during my sophomore year would suggest the opposite.</p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans? </strong>I want to become an actuary for an insurance company. If that doesn’t work out, my brothers and I have joked about opening up our own business; maybe a sub shop since we all have a passion for food, or an insurance company since Matt and I both have some experience in that industry. I also hope to get married, have kids, and own a boat and a big house on a lake where I can fish all the time.</p>
<p><strong>What’s it like playing on the same line as Michael Porembski? </strong>Playing with Mike is really something. He is a good player who always works hard and knows his assignment on every play. Having him around makes other players better because he always brings the intensity level up. He always gives great effort and plays to the whistle. He is a good friend, and I hope our friendship does not become extinct after college.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/12/porembskihs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-622" title="Michael Porembski" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/12/porembskihs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Michael Porembski</strong></p>
<p><strong>How much of an honor was it being named first-team all-conference last season? </strong>It was a tremendous honor to be named to the first team. It was rewarding to know that all of the hard work paid off, and it was nice to get some recognition as an offensive lineman.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Do you prefer to run block or pass block, and why? </strong>Run block, for sure. You get to go after the defensive lineman and make his life difficult instead of sitting back and waiting for him. In run blocking, it’s more physicality and determination, while pass blocking is more about technique.</p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans? </strong>After graduation, I will be working for an investment bank in New York City. After that, I have no idea. I’m just going to go with the flow. <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s it like playing on the same line as Phil Musick? </strong>It’s always interesting playing on the line with Phil. He started out playing nose guard on defense, so I didn’t really like him when he first came over. Actually, I still don’t, to be honest. I’m kidding, of course. He’s a great competitor who always plays hard, but also enjoys joking around in practice. He’s one of the hardest-working kids and someone who always pushes the rest of us to be the best.</p>

			<p><em>Five more profiles of seniors on the Muhlenberg football team. <a title="Senior Profiles: Football, Part 1 of 4" href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/2011/12/13/senior-profiles-football-part-1-of-4/">Part 1</a> and <a title="Senior Profiles: Football, Part 2 of 4" href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/2011/12/14/senior-profiles-football-part-2-of-4/">Part 2</a> ran earlier this week, and we&#8217;ll finish up with the four senior captains tomorrow.</em></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/12/ryanhs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-613" title="Kevin Ryan" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/12/ryanhs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Kevin Ryan</strong></p>
<p><strong>Six is not a typical number for a defensive back; how did you end up wearing it?</strong><em> </em>I originally wore the number back in high school for both baseball and football, and when I arrived at Muhlenberg my freshman year, six was the number they gave me. I thought that was pretty cool, and six kind of just became a part of me. And now it’s my favorite number.</p>
<p><strong>What was it like punting last year? </strong>I had never punted before in my life. One practice, coach came up to me and told me I was going to start punting. I never thought I’d actually end up punting in a game, though. Don’t get me wrong, I had some stellar punts in my short-lived career, but I think it’s safe to say it was a failed experiment.<em></em></p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans? </strong>Make millions of dollars through penny stocks. Then buying a WNBA franchise and leading it to multiple championships. The Dalai Lama himself once told me that on my deathbed I would receive total consciousness. So I’ve got that going for me, which is nice.<em></em></p>
<p><strong>What kind of teammate is Gregg Mercogliano?</strong><em> </em>Gregg “The Leg” Mercogliano is the best teammate one could have. Secretly, he is the funniest kid on the team. Armed with feathered and lethal hair, “The Leg” is the backbone of Muhlenberg Special Forces. Cogs is a go-getter. Most people would back down from certain challenges, such as a 4th-and-19 fake punt, but not Cogs. With zero hesitation, he put his blazing speed to work running with such gracefulness the he reminded the crowd of a young Barry Sanders. He may have come up a couple yards shy, but nevertheless, Cogs is one man I’m grateful to have on my team.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/12/mercoglianohs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-614" title="Gregg Mercogliano" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/12/mercoglianohs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Gregg Mercogliano</strong> </p>
<p><strong>How rewarding does it feel to be making an impact in your final season? </strong>It’s been a great feeling to contribute to the team this year on game day. I stayed committed during the summer to make this season an important and memorable one. I’m glad it is paying off so far. Having a great snapper and holder helps as well.</p>
<p><strong>What was the feeling like when your 44-yard field goal sailed through the uprights at Gettysburg? </strong>It felt good. We spend a lot of time in practice working on situational field goals, and to make a long one in a game felt rewarding. Unfortunately, the outcome of the game didn’t turn out the way we wanted it to. <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans? </strong>I plan on working in the accounting field in either Philadelphia or New York. I also plan on hopefully passing the CPA exam. If I can’t get a job right away, I plan on trading stocks during the day.  </p>
<p><strong>What kind of player is Steve Nissley? </strong>Niss is a great teammate and one of my best friends. On the field, he’s known for his strong work ethic and physical toughness. Off the field, he’s known for his fashion style. He has a nice collection of Armani watches and always seems to be wearing a classic pair of penny loafers. I’m glad I became friends with Niss and know he will have a successful future.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/12/nissleyhs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-615" title="Steve Nissley" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/12/nissleyhs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Steve Nissley</strong></p>
<p><strong>You’ve made the Centennial Conference Academic Honor Roll; how have you been able to balance your time between school and football? </strong>Finding time to study and finish work for class can be a struggle during the season. At times I’ve had to pass on going out with some friends to finish some work, but playing football and maintaining good grades have taught me how to manage my time well. Looking back on it, I have no idea how I managed playing football, classes and living in the crazy world of Benfer for two straight years.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What off-the-field accomplishment are you most proud of? </strong>I would say starting up and successfully running my business, “Fresh-Niss Barber Shop,” incorporated in 2008, providing Muhlenberg College with a one-of-a-kind look. I like to think of myself as Van Gogh with clippers in my hand, just dishing out masterpieces left and right. I can also cut with scissors, and have perfected “the visor” look specifically for my good friend Gregg “4G connecting from anywhere on the field” Mercogliano. Additionally, I’m looking for investors to help expand my business along the East Coast and eventually overseas.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans? </strong>I’m hoping to get out and travel a little after graduation before I start working in the fall at Deloitte. I’m leaning towards Las Vegas for its spontaneity.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s Kevin Ryan like off the field? </strong>A wise man once told me, “Never trust a man with two first names.” Kevin Ryan is definitely a character. Some of the things that go through his head could be classified under Area 51 — just straight up unexplainable. But when push comes to shove, I know he would have my back. Kev is a great friend, and it has been a pleasure playing ball with him over the past four years. We’ve had some good memories and many more to come.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/12/nadellhs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-616" title="Chase Nadell" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/12/nadellhs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Chase Nadell</strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s the biggest hit you’ve ever delivered?</strong> It would have to be against Gettysburg my junior year. I came in untouched off the edge and just crushed the helpless running back. This is a funny game because you never want to hit to cause serious injury, but you always want to hit to instill a little fear in your opponent’s mind for the next time he’s carrying or catching the ball. That was one of those hits that let Gettysburg know we were there. <em></em></p>
<p><strong>What’s the most memorable moment from your Mule career?</strong><em> </em>The first time I returned a kickoff against Union. I was so nervous and wondered how bad it was going to hurt when I got tackled. It turned out I would have to wait until the next return to see how it felt because I ended up taking that kick back 87 yards for a touchdown. It was my first touchdown and ended up being the game-winner.</p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans? </strong>I don’t know exactly what they are, but in the near future I plan to travel around Europe. It’s an experience that I always wanted to have. I feel that by traveling and seeing new things in different places, I’ll get a different perspective on living. I am thinking about going into wealth management for a career.<em></em></p>
<p><strong>What’s it been like playing both football and lacrosse with Andy Curley?</strong><em> </em>It has been more than amazing playing with Andy Curley. The man is one of my best friends. I am always trying to spend more time with him, but he’s always breaking our plans to go see the shows at the Center for the Arts; he just can’t get enough of the musicals. Seeing that Curley is in his fifth year here, a lot of the guys see him as a father figure and role model. He is never too busy to pass on his wisdom about the good old days and will never be afraid to teach you some pointers he’s picked up over his tenure here. It’s been a pleasure to have played with Andy, and I hope that he becomes a successful doctor so he can fix me after the season.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/curleyhs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-89" title="Andy Curley" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/09/curleyhs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Andy Curley</strong></p>
<p><strong>How great does it feel to be back on the field after being injured most of last season? What made you decide to come back for a fifth year? </strong>It feels great. Having to watch my teammates play my senior year was pretty tough to go through. This season definitely gives me a sense of closure on my career.<em> </em>I wanted to make sure Pat McDonough never got an interception, so I stepped in front of him to grab one at F&amp;M. Robbing him of that made it all worthwhile.<em></em></p>
<p><strong>What’s the most memorable moment from your Mule career? </strong>My freshman year we went 10-0 and then beat Salisbury during the first round of the playoffs. Since my cousin was the starting quarterback of that Salisbury team, it made our family Thanksgiving dinner the following week pretty enjoyable because I got to rub it in on him.</p>
<p><strong>You’ve been named to the Centennial Conference Academic Honor Roll six times; how have you been able to continually excel in the classroom while also playing two sports? </strong>I take it one day at a time, don’t sleep a lot and drink a lot of coffee.</p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans? </strong>I plan on attending medical school so I can become a doctor and fix other broken athletes that are aging way too fast like me. If that doesn’t work, I’ll probably just look into retirement and live with my parents for the rest of my life.<em></em></p>
<p><strong>What’s it been like playing both football and lacrosse with Chase Nadell?</strong><em> </em>Anybody that knows him agrees that I could write a collection of novels on Captain Chase and it still wouldn’t tell the whole story. He is unbelievably competitive, always energetic and a soft, caring person deep down inside. You could be having the worst day of your life, but you would forget about it by talking to Chase for five minutes. I can honestly say that I have never met anybody in my life like Chase, and I doubt I ever will. Chase is a person that everybody wants to be around, and I have been lucky to play with him here.</p>

			<p><em><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/?p=594">Yesterday</a>, we brought you five profiles of Muhlenberg senior football players. Here are five more.</em></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/12/musickmhs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-603" title="Matt Musick" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/12/musickmhs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Matt Musick </strong></p>
<p><strong>What has been the key to your special teams success?</strong> Be prideful. There’s this stigma about playing special teams that somehow it’s not of equal importance to starting on defense or offense, but our coaching staff preaches the opposite. And truthfully, most close games come down to a big special teams play or field position through special teams. I love playing outside linebacker, but there is still no adrenaline rush like running down on the opening kickoff.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What was it like studying abroad in Australia this past spring? </strong>Australia is a magnificent country, and I saw places and did things that are hard to believe and even harder to describe. By far the best decision I have made in my life, going to Australia changed my perspective on a lot of things, and I can’t wait to continue traveling and seeing different parts of the world. Once my bank account recovers from last semester, that is.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What it’s like having a twin, especially one who is on the same team? </strong>I always get asked this question and don’t know how to respond because I don’t know what it’s like to not have a twin. Anyone who knows the two of us can see that we’re very different people. Physically, Phil’s got maybe half an inch on me and about 200 pounds. Characteristically, he’s a numbers geek; I’m a writer. He’s in bed early; I’m out late. Being on the same team isn’t much different than growing up with him. We compete against each other on the practice field every day, and Coach Hannis tries to make an event of us going against each other in one-on-one drills. He calls it, “The Battle for the Last Pork Chop.” It’s a good time until Phil gets angry and starts cutting at the knees, but that’s another story. <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans? </strong>Just enjoy the ride.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What kind of teammate is Mike Fiorillo? </strong>“Fi” is the best. He’s not only a teammate, but one of my best friends. We’ve spent a lot of time together on and off the field. He works hard and makes sure he is as prepared as possible when game time rolls around. We’ve bonded a lot, mainly through our position as the vertically challenged linebackers. A man with great affinity for wisdom and words, he started what became known as the “Fi”ctionary; a group of words or phrases he has somehow produced that don’t necessarily exist. These words are often best stated with extreme movement of the hands.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/12/fiorillohs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-604" title="Mike Fiorillo" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/12/fiorillohs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Mike Fiorillo</strong></p>
<p><strong>How have you improved since your freshman year? </strong>Since my freshman year, I’ve improved a lot. It took me about a year and a half to really understand the defense, and when I finally did I became a much better player. It also helped that I shed about 20 pounds and got in much better shape.</p>
<p><strong>What do you feel is the strongest part of your game? </strong>I’m pretty small for an inside linebacker, so I would say that being quick is a good attribute, along with being a solid pass defender.</p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans? </strong>I’ve worked for Aramark in the summer for about six years and really have enjoyed it. I would love to get a [full-time] job with Aramark. But if all else fails, I’ll go to Vegas and try to make it big.</p>
<p><strong>What kind of person is Mark Mounayar? </strong>Mark and I have been pretty good friends since freshman year, and I’ve never had anything bad to say about him. He came in playing offensive line; it didn’t work out for him over there, and he got moved to nose guard. But instead of complaining, he just keeps beating up the opposing center every week and making our team better.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/12/mounayarhs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-605" title="Mark Mounayar" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/12/mounayarhs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Mark Mounayar</strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s the most lasting memory from your football career? </strong>It was really special to be a starter on a championship team last year. My most lasting memory was probably the Ursinus game at home because the championship was on the line, and we got the job done.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>You’ve played on both the offensive and defensive lines; which do you prefer and why? </strong>I truly miss playing offensive line, but I definitely prefer playing defense. Playing offensive line was a bit more complicated than playing defensive line. I’m glad the coaches left me on the PAT team so I still get to line up with the O-line sometimes.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>How did you choose mathematics as your major? </strong>I know it sounds weird to most people, but math has been my favorite subject in school for as far back as I can remember. I decided to declare as a math major freshman year when I realized that I can’t write papers.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans? </strong>To graduate and find a job.</p>
<p><strong>What’s Matt Musick like off the field? </strong>On the field in games, at practice or even in intramural basketball, you know Musick is going to raise the intensity and get people fired up. Off the field, though, Matt is much calmer, down-to-earth and easy-going. Matt has been a great friend for four years and will continue to be for many more.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/12/cobbhs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-606" title="Kenneth Cobb" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/12/cobbhs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Kenneth Cobb</strong></p>
<p><strong>What have been the keys to your success both last season and this year? </strong>The keys to my success have always been hard work and determination, but I owe most of my success to my teammates and coaches.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s your favorite move to put on an offensive lineman? </strong>My favorite move on an offensive lineman would be the bull rush. The feeling of running over someone is a little more thrilling than running around.</p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans? </strong>My plans were to finish up my remaining credits, take the CPA exam and hit the work force next year. But with a possible extra year of eligibility, I have to make a decision.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What has it been like getting to play for four more years with your high school teammate Victor Taiwo? </strong>It’s been great. To be able to grow as a player, and even more as person, with my best friend has been great.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/12/taiwohs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-607" title="Victor Taiwo" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/12/taiwohs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Victor Taiwo</strong></p>
<p><strong>How have you improved since your freshman year? </strong>Freshman year I was “all brawn, no brain.” I had no clue what I was doing and was lost most of the time. Sophomore year, I got about two of the hundred-plus plays down. I found myself asking freshmen what to do, which was a warning sign that my days as a linebacker were coming to an end. The coaches felt that it would be best to move me the defensive line. My junior year was a transitional year, and I started becoming a student of the game. All the pieces are finally coming together. I guess it’s better late than never.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s your most memorable off-the-field moment or accomplishment from your time at Muhlenberg? </strong>This past summer, I got the chance to attend a national conference of race and ethnicity in San Francisco with the Muhlenberg College Office of Multicultural Life. I had the privilege to meet many people from various backgrounds and talk to them about their point of view on current issues of race, gender and identity. It was an experience that really helped me grow as a person and improved my knowledge about different life styles.</p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans?</strong> I am currently pursuing a job in pharmaceutical sales. Kenny [Cobb] and I have also thought about coaching a high school football team after we make our riches. I would be the offensive coordinator and head coach, while he would coach the defense and special teams.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What has it been like getting to play for four more years with your high school teammate Kenneth Cobb?</strong> Playing with Cobb has been something special, even though he would never admit that he came to Muhlenberg because he could not imagine a life without me. Having that brother that you know to push you and bring out the best in you is something that I could never have dreamed of, and Kenny does just that. Although our eight years of playing football together are coming to an end, I am sure we will still find something to compete against each other with.</p>
