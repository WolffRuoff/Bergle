He mentioned that librarians earlier in the 20th century commonly perceived their mission as protecting innocent young people from &#8220;pornographic&#8221; or otherwise &#8220;perverse&#8221; publications. Their mission (or the common perception of their mission), thanks largely to the American Library Association, shifted in the latter half of the 20th century to ensuring that readers, especially adult readers, could access information without censorship.<\/p>\n<p>(A history of the shaping of librarian identity in relation to censorship has been explored in a book by Louise Robbins titled\u00a0<strong><span style=\"color: #000000\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.worldcat.org\/title\/censorship-and-the-american-library-the-american-library-associations-response-to-threats-to-intellectual-freedom-1939-1969\/oclc\/246420481\"><em>Censorship and the American Library<\/em><\/a><\/span><\/strong>. )<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>Infomaniac Tip<\/strong><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><em><strong>SmARThistory<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #000000\"><a href=\"http:\/\/smarthistory.khanacademy.org\/\"><em>Smarthistory.org<\/em><\/a><\/span><\/strong><span style=\"color: #000000\">, now part of the<strong>\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.khanacademy.org\/\"><em>Khan Academy<\/em><\/a><\/strong><\/span>, is a free, not-for-profit, multi-media web-book designed as a dynamic enhancement (or even substitute) for the traditional art history textbook.

Soon after, we embedded the audio files in our online survey courses. The response from our students was so positive that we decided to create a multi-media survey of art history web-book. We created audios and videos about works of art found in standard art history survey texts, organized the files stylistically and chronologically, and added text and still images.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>Calendar<\/strong><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>October 4:<\/strong>\u00a0A faculty panel composed of Profs.
