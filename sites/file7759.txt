								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since its creation in the early 1990s, there has been an explosion of growth in the internet. Everything has changed since then in terms of browsers, formatting, even the features that people use every day. The amount of change from 1991 to 2012 is staggering. Internet browsers didn’t even come around until 1993 with Mosaic. As the internet progressed, webpages had to become flashier to make an impact. This prompted the creation of things such as Flash, Java, and Javascript giving developers the “ability to create new generations of useful and immersive web experiences” (Vizzuality, 2012) which continue to dominate the internet scene even today. As time went on, the need for better browsers with more capabilities became necessary like how everyone wants the newest smartphone because it’s “better” than the last one that works perfectly fine. Internet traffic didn’t start to pick up until the early 2000s where more and more things were online. The increase in users and data usage again gave rise to more browsers with the older ones dying off. Web browsers continued to evolve and receive new features such as Drag and Drop in early 2008 and Web Workers, which runs things without interaction from the user such as ad blockers, in early 2009. As the internet grows in use, browsers will continue to evolve. We might expect the future to hold things we can’t even dream of today. Technological advances will further change the way the internet is used even in the foreseeable future.</p>
