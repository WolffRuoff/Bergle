					<description><![CDATA[Very nicely done, Group 1!  You&#039;ve found a great article and connected it directly to power roles and the importance of linking pins.  In a sense, the record and advertising industries have been working hand in hand for quite a long time.  Think about how many times you&#039;ve heard a Top 40 hit as the soundtrack to a major advertisement - probably too many times to even count.  Here, though, the goal seems to be also to promote Eminem both as a celebrity and as a recording artist.  Your example of Madonna was god - Britney Spears and the late Michael Jackson also did the exact same kind of marketing with Pepsi, for instance.  This is definitely what I am hoping you&#039;ll accomplish with these blog posts - Nice job!]]></description>
