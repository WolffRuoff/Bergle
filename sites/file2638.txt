					<description><![CDATA[You make a good point here, Group 5, that social media are of tremendous interest to advertisers because they offer highly engaged consumers and because consumers will continually choose to seek out these media as a place to discuss their lives and other things too (like Superbowl ads, as you point out).  I wonder what you think about the possibility of advertising becoming an addition to these services, though?  Would consumers rebel if they noticed that banner advertising and other forms of intrusion by advertisers into social media?  This might raise consumer ire and fuel a backlash.  As such, what you&#039;ve described here is really a kind of viral marketing being attempted by advertisers.  I look forward to seeing more posts on the influence of other types of online media and connections between online and traditional media.  Onwards!]]></description>
