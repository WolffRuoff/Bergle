								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here we are at the final week of classes. This will be the last time that I sit in a classroom and I don&#8217;t really know how to feel about it.</p>
<p>I am definitely excited not to have anymore tests or papers, but as much as I usually hope these last couple of weeks of the semester will move quickly, it is not the case this time. I am trying everything I can to enjoy every second of these last few weeks and try to slow things down. Finishing class and finals will not have the same feel this time around.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am sitting on my computer as I begin getting more and more emails about Senior Week approaching and registering for events during that week. It is hard to believe how fast college is coming to an end.</p>
<p>At this point I am not sure if I have come to terms with everything or if maybe I still haven&#8217;t comprehended that this will all be ending very soon. Of course I don&#8217;t want college to end, it has been four of the best years of my life, but I do think I have gotten myself ready for it.</p>
<p>It is still hard to tell how I will feel when graduation gets here and then comes to an end. This will be the first time in my life that I will begin a summer and there will not be a next year of college to follow. There is no denying it will be a major adjustment and will definitely feel weird for a while.</p>
<p>After some time passes there will be a new routine for me of going to work each day. It makes for longer days, but it does mean there are no more tests or papers that need to be completed. It will be a new and exciting chapter of my life.</p>
