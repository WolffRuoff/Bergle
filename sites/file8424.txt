								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Internet has arguably become the most powerful thing known to mankind. It is one of the most popular and most widely used things by humans.  It has the ability to connect people worldwide literally making the world a smaller place. Online, you have the choice to be well known or anonymous, funny or serious, even evil or good hearted. The power of the Internet is unlimited and continues to grow every day. One of the scariest aspects of the Internet however is the fact that everybody has the ability to be anonymous. Anonymity is a very complicated thing, especially when it is applied on the Internet. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The video I watched was a TED Talk titled, </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Christopher &#8220;moot&#8221; Poole&#8221;: The case for anonymity online. Christopher Poole is famous for founding the anonymous imageboard website 4chan in which users can post anonymously on any topic they wish. It is famous for many memes including lolcats and rickroll. It is also notoriously known for many of the bad things the Internet has to offer. Interestingly enough, Poole did not really talk about the bad things that 4chan causes like the threats and the degradation of certain people. The closest thing he comes to talking about the bad side of 4chan are the rules, Poole says</span><span style="font-weight: 400">, “So does a site like this have rules? We do; they&#8217;re the codified rules that I&#8217;ve come up with, which are more-or-less ignored by the community.” This seems like an excuse that Poole is making. He is trying to explain that the fact that 4chan has a very negative connotation attached to it is not his fault. He even says, “The content is not dinner table conversation in the least.” This just shows how most of the content of 4chan is not of quality. I believe this is due to the fact that it is an anonymous site. I bet if 4chan required a username or picture that would eliminate the anonymity aspect of 4chan, the site would be very different from what it is like now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anonymity is also a very dangerous thing on the Internet because many people think that since they are anonymous they can do whatever they want. This is not the case, Poole says, </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And last, I&#8217;m going to show you the example, the story of Dusty the cat. Dusty is the name that we&#8217;ve given to this cat. This young man posted a video of him abusing his cat on YouTube. And, you know, this didn&#8217;t sit well with people, and so there was this outpouring of support for people to do something about this. So what they did is they &#8212; I mean, they put CSI to shame here &#8212; the Internet detectives came out.They matched, they found his MySpace. They took the YouTube video and they mashed everything in the video. Within 24 hours, they had his name, and within 48 hours, he was arrested.”</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This just shows how no matter what you do online and no matter how anonymous it is you might end up getting caught for something bad that you did. You always have to be aware of the consequences of every action, even online.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Overall, the Internet is anonymous whether we like it or not. I believe that you can have a great time on the Internet as long as you are safe. Since the Internet is anonymous you can have no idea who is who online therefore it is important to act just the way you would in real life. Sites like 4chan encourage bad behavior because of the anonymity aspect if it. One of the most important aspects of the internet that more people should follow is to be more aware of how they are behaving online.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Most children from a very young age are taught that lying is bad. They are told it will only get them in more trouble and cause problems. Kids do believe this and try not to lie. But when a child lies and gets away with it he or she won’t understand what the consequences might be if they are caught. This happens primarily online where a kid lies and doesn&#8217;t get caught and therefore sees no repercussions from lying so they continue to do it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The chapter I read was </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Kids Online Lying as the New Social Norm?</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> From the book, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">From Fear to Facebook: One School’s Journey</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> by Matt Levinson. One of the main themes that occurs in the chapter is how more and more kids are lying online. There is no one online to tell the kids that lying is bad online. Levinson writes, “Kids need role models to help them learn, but in online life, there are no adult role models available,” (2010, pp.64). What Levinson is saying is that they have no one to look up to online. Kids have no idea how to act online because there are no role models. How are they supposed to know how to act when there is no supervision. This can be compared to William Golding’s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Lord of the Flies</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> where the boys trapped on the island have no idea how to act with no adult supervision and therefore begin to slowly fall apart. In real life, kids look to their parents or teachers for guidance. But online they look to the other people they are with who sometimes are not the best role models. This is a recipe for disaster because odds are that the other people online with these kids are other kids who might be lying too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Another theme that comes up in the chapter is the dishonest use of cell phones. As more kids are gaining access to mobile devices, it is becoming more easier for them to cheat. Levinson writes, “In the area of cheating, the findings grow more alarming. Of the 1,013 teens surveyed, 35% admit to cheating at least once with their cell phones. Teens are more likely to say that their friends are cheating than they are, as 65% of teens say they have seen or heard about other people in their school cheating with cell phones.” (2010. pp. 66). Cell phones could be considered as hand held cheating devices. It is getting easier to cheat and lie on tests due to cell phones and their ability to take pictures and send text messages. As technology becomes more integrated with our lives, parents and other role models must teach kids that cheating and lying is not okay just because it happens over cyberspace.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Overall, kids are gaining access to technology a lot earlier in their lives than anyone else. Most people gained the access to technology when they were old enough to understand that lying and cheating is bad in real life so they knew not to do it online. Nowadays kids are gaining access to technology before they even realize what is good and bad in real life so they have no idea how to act online. I believe that if parents can teach their children that whatever is not okay in real life probably is not okay online the next generation of children will lie and cheat a lot less.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you were to tell the creators of the internet how big and how widely used it would become in the 21st century, they probably would laugh at you. They would not understand how regular users have made it what it has become. The Internet now has the ability to connect so many people though laughter using a single media object and a phrase. These funny and sometimes disturbing images or media objects are known throughout the internet world as memes. Memes however, can become extremely dangerous. They can degrade individuals and even whole groups of people as well as causing damage to cultures and ethnicities. Memes can be extremely funny for everyone if used properly.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The peer-reviewed article I read was </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Reflections on Internet Culture</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">. The article talked about internet memes and how society reacted to them. Some memes pass through the eyes of the internet harmlessly while others may not. One major theme that appears throughout the article is how what you say or do online may affect other things offline. Zittrain writes, “Star Wars Kid turned to the court system, and filed a host of lawsuits against the school, the kids, their parents,” (Zittrain, 2014, p. 390). Star Wars Kid was a video that received 28 million hits on Youtube of a kid who was swinging a golf ball retriever not knowing he was being recorded. His friends thought it would be funny if they posted it online, it became an instant hit. This just goes to show how you never know how somebody will react when you post something about them online. Something may seem harmless to post online at first but may actually be harmful in the long run.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This can relate to another major theme brought up in the article. The theme of  online privacy and the argument of whether it is right to post about someone online just because it is funny. The author uses the example of Disaster girl in his writing, “a perfect example of unsought fame of a sort. She is not superimposed in the photo. She is actually standing in front of that house. The element of authenticity that this photo captures so well, though, means there is a real person implicated as it starts to go viral” (Zittrain, 2014, p. 389). I believe what the author is saying is that these people did not mind that they became famous through a meme. They thought it was funny when people would take the picture of a cute innocent girl standing in front of a burning house and add a funny caption. Other people, like Star Wars Kid, did not think it was so funny when they were posted online.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Overall, I think memes are great. They can be funny, insightful, and even inspiring. They have the ability to make people laugh and share a connection together. I also believe that since they are so powerful they can be used to hurt people. The argument of online privacy is found in every part of the internet including memes. I believe that if people are a little more careful with the power of memes they can be more enjoyable for everyone.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When people talk about Microsoft, the first thing that usually comes to people’s mind is Bill Gates and the software that he developed that made people’s lives so much easier. What a lot of people do not know however, is that Microsoft has many more services and software products marketed toward teens and gamers. The Wikipedia article I read was on Xbox Live which is an online multiplayer gaming and digital media delivery service developed by Microsoft. Most teens know about Xbox Live because it allows you to play video games online with your friends. It is an extremely popular service and mostly everyone that has ever owned a Microsoft gaming product has used it at least once. Xbox Live comes in two forms, Xbox Live Free and Xbox Live Gold. Xbox Live Gold being a subscription based service. Xbox Live offers a wide variety of features for the user. The most popular being the online gaming portion of the service.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One main theme that occurs from a lot of these gaming services is immersion. Most of them allow you to create and control an avatar and become fully immersed in the gaming world. As well as creating avatars, players can create and customize profiles based on their offline personalities and interests. Some people are skeptical of this because more and more kids are spending the majority of their time with online gaming. All these different elements of Xbox Live make it difficult for the user to get off. It has become addicting to some people to the point where they do not want to leave the gaming world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Microsoft has done something really smart with Xbox Live. They have made so many first and third party apps available on the service that it makes the user feel like he or she will never have to go anywhere else to use them. This means that Microsoft has essentially made Xbox Live the go to service to use these apps. Microsoft figures that the people using Xbox Live are most likely digital natives, so they market and sell Xbox Live accordingly. They also supply features on Xbox Live that fit that description. This is smart because as a digital native I figure that any apps I want to use will probably be on my Xbox. This maximizes the amount of users Xbox Live will have at any given moment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With online interaction also comes the dangers of cyberbullying, but what Xbox Live has done is that it has integrated different features to be safe online like muting, reporting, and blocking. It even has a “reputation” feature that allows people to see how good your in game conduct is. The truth is Xbox Live is expanding and it will keep getting bigger and more popular. Wikipedia writes, “As of December 16, 2012, Xbox Live is currently available in 42 countries/territories” and “Bloomberg estimates that Xbox Live likely generated over </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar"><span style="font-weight: 400">$</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">1 billion in revenue in the 2010 fiscal year, which ended on June 30, 2010.” These facts are only a little bit of information on how big Xbox Live could become especially with the progression of technology and gaming. I agree on the fact that Xbox Live is getting bigger because I know gaming is too. Online gaming can only get more popular as more people are looking for services to allow them to play online.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Overall, I believe Xbox Live is an extremely useful and popular service that lets you connect with people and friends all around the world, 42 countries to be exact. Gaming and online gaming services have just began to scratch the surface of all the different possibilities. It will be exciting to see in the future how much it can potentially expand.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Cyber Bullying and Facebook</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Social media has taken up a huge part of our daily lives. Without it we feel lost, unconnected with society, and left out. We have almost become completely dependent on it. I couldn&#8217;t imagine a day going without facebook, and many other people couldn&#8217;t either. We spend so much time online and meet so many new people through social networking it’s hard to tell who’s who online.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The article I read, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Cyberbullying on Facebook, How to Teach Teens About it?</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> Explains how the majority of our younger generation spends their time interacting online, especially on social media. The author explains the dangers of social media and the stigma associated with it. With all this time interacting online comes the danger of cyber bullying. People do not realize how prevalent and easy it is for someone to be bullied online. Bullies look to the internet and social media because it is easier to hurt someone online when there is an added anonymity factor. Bullies feel like it’s okay to bully other people online because they think it won’t hurt the other person. The author writes, “Cyber bullying takes behaviour born in the schoolyard and adds two elements: ubiquity and anonymity.” This is a very scary concept because what the author is saying is that a bully can be anywhere and anyone when you’re online. You never really know who is who online and you can never be sure that who you meet online is actually that person in real life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One main theme that comes up throughout the article is how people choose to behave online. The author writes, “Words that appeared frequently included “rude,” “mean,” “fake,” “crude,” “over-dramatic,” and “disrespectful.”’ I believe the sole reason that people are unkind online is anonymity. People feel as if there is a shield blocking them from the outside world. That is not true. Everything you say online stays there. Even when you think something is deleted, chances are it’s still there. Something you say online can hurt someone just as much if not more than if you said it to them in person. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A lot of people choose to act differently online because they feel like they can be someone else and change who they are. The author writes, “Often teens felt bolder, ruder, or more empowered </span><a href="http://nobullying.com/cyber-safety-facebook-and-real-life-the-struggle/"><span style="font-weight: 400">because they did not fear physical violence in the online space</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">.” The author also writes, “More often than not, teens believe that they find friends and romantic interests much easier to talk to and way more open in a Facebook chat conversation than in a playground or classroom context.” Both these quotes are related by anonymity. The fact that you can talk to someone (and possibly harm them as well) without being face to face with them. Some people may feel more comfortable talking online then in person.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Cyber bullying is connected with facebook in many ways, one of them being its popularity. So many people have access to facebook and it’s so easy to find people that it might be a cyber bully’s first place to look. The author says, “It can lead to the end of friendships, problems with parents, or wanting to avoid school. According to pewinternet.org, 88% of social media-using teens have seen someone be mean or cruel on Facebook.” 88% is a huge number of people who witness cyberbullying. Think of how large that number would be if private messaging didn’t exist and everything was public. That is just one of the reasons cyberbullying on Facebook is so prevalent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But cyber bullying isn&#8217;t just exclusive to facebook or any other type of social media. The author writes, “There has been considerable concern among parents, teachers, policy makers, and advocates about the nature and intensity of online social encounters among teens. The majority of teens have positive online experiences, but some are caught in an online feedback loop of meanness and negative experiences.” Cyber bullying can happen anywhere, to anyone, and at anytime. The dangers of social media will always be present as long as people continue to use it. Overall, I agree with everything the author says. Cyber bullying is a problem. I don’t think there is a way to stop it. I believe the only way to limit it, is to educate children about cyberbullying and the dangers of social media when used improperly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The article, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Want to Be a Better Writer? Read More.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> Is not only a piece about how someone must read in order to become better at writing, but also how reading influences other aspects of one’s life. It explains the many benefits of reading and how it can improve our daily lives. Some examples include, better writing skills, better study habits, and better mental health. It explains how a good writer can only achieve greatness by reading. Hanski writes, “Writing is a skill. But this skill is very complicated, because it can&#8217;t be got by simple learning of grammar rules, punctuation marks, and different writing techniques. Certainly, you should know how to write correctly, but only reading can help you achieve greatness.” I agree with this because writing, just like anything else need practice. No one got good at any type of sport without hard work and dedication. Hanski says how, “Writing is a skill.” I believe a skill is someone’s ability to master an activity. People require practice if they wish to be talented at something. Reading is one of the many ways one can better themselves as a writer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I also believe Hanski is saying that reading forces the brain to work therefor making it stronger in the end. Hanski writes, “Science confirms that </span><a href="http://news.stanford.edu/news/2012/september/austen-reading-fmri-090712.html"><span style="font-weight: 400">reading has a positive influence on your brain</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">: blood flows to it, improving brain&#8217;s functioning and connectivity; moreover, it has been proved that this functioning improves for days! So, read books &#8212; and you will help your brain function better.” Just like any muscle, the more you work it, the stronger it will get. Same thing goes for the brain. Once strong enough, it will become easier to do complex tasks such as writing. Many skills are intertwined so if you are practicing one thing there is a chance you are getting better at another.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Some would argue that an art form, like writing, cannot be taught. I believe that to a certain extent, this is true. An artist must add their own personal expression to their pieces. That is one of the things that makes art, art.  Hanski says, “Being a writer, you&#8217;ll probably agree with the fact that the art of writing is nearly impossible to teach. It is impossible to finish some courses on creative writing or graduate from some university with a diploma of &#8220;a professional writer.&#8221;’ What Hanski is saying here is that any art form, writing especially, cannot be taught. Only the fundamentals of an art form can be taught. Take music for example, you can teach a musician how to read music and play pieces correctly but you cannot teach him how to play with expression. That is something he must figure out for himself. That is one of the reasons why art is so difficult because only the artist can make it his own.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Overall, writing is complex because it cannot be taught. It is a skill one develops and masters over time. It is the writer&#8217;s job to figure out what does and does not work for him, and reading can help.</span></p>
