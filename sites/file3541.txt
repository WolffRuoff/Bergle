<p><span style="font-size: small;font-family: Calibri">Rubino L., (2011, April 5). Lexus, KitchenAid, Chase Sapphire To Sponsor Bravo’s ‘Top Chef Masters.’ Broadcasting and Cable, Retrieved from <a href="//www.broadcastingcable.com/article/466349-Lexus_KitchenAid_Chase_Sapphire_To_Sponsor_Bravo_s_Top_Chef_Masters_.php">http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/466349-Lexus_KitchenAid_Chase_Sapphire_To_Sponsor_Bravo_s_Top_Chef_Masters_.php</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;font-family: Calibri">The third season of <em>Top Chef Masters</em> gains new sponsors. Bravo has announced Lexus, KitchenAid, and Chase Sapphire will donate a total of 250,000 to various charities throughout the season. Along with donating to charities these prestigious companies will have a plethora of in-show product integration including equipment used by contestants and the cars that drive them each episode. Not only will these products be used on the show, the companies will give out prizes to the chefs who win challenges, the grand prize of $100,000 to the show’s winner, and prizes to on line fans who compete in games through the Bravo TV website. Aside from these three major companies Bravo has made a deal with <em>New York</em> magazine to feature a <em>Top Chef Masters</em> exclusive section on its website.<span id="more-1090"></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;font-family: Calibri"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small"><span style="font-family: Calibri">These partnerships provide a bevy of advertising opportunities that are not just limited to commercials. With the increase of on line and DVR viewership networks like Bravo have to increasingly become more creative in the way they highlight their sponsors. Bravo uses the internet as a linking pin between its fans and the show by providing not only the television content but also interactive games and contests. Advertisers see this as another way to market their products to not only people watching the show, but people using the internet. Not only are these big money corporations trying to sell a product, they are working hard to exude a good public image; through their multiple donations throughout the season they will be extending their services to more than just fans and competitors. KitchenAid and Lexus not only fill the investor power role but also serve as an auxiliary role for Bravo and <em>Top Chef Masters</em>. This is beneficial for the show because not only do they gain much needed sponsorship funds, they also are saving money by having their advertisers fit the Top Chef kitchens with everything a gourmet chef could dream of. With the shows increased popularity Bravo has stepped up their game, moving on from their former Toyota sponsorship and on to a luxury brand like Lexus.  </span></span></p>
