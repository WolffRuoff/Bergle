<p>Amanda Leigh, Idabel Okla.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I believe that the younger the child, the more important it is to study subjects that will develop his or her individual potential to function intellectually. Any normal or bright youngster in elementary school must learn to read, write and do math at increasingly difficult levels. With time, this expands to include reading, literature, writing essays and handling the math and logic of the sciences, including the science of mathematics.

</strong><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dance Education: Can I Make a Living?</span></strong></p>
<p>By: Stephanie Spencer</p>
<p>I have spent the last ten years of my life trying to convince myself, and those around me, that dance education is a viable career choice. Dance education is based on the comparison of how your body moves and feels in space and how others move and feel in space. Through dance education you can broaden your sense of self and awareness of others. It is the science of nonverbal communication; a language that is often overlooked or remains subconscious in our society. This language is a powerful tool in relating to yourself and the world around you. So, why did it take me so many years to convince myself that I could have a viable career teaching dance?</p>
<p>I started as a pre-medical student as an undergraduate because it seemed like an esteemed career choice. It did not occur to me that I could make a living with dance. I was told to make it my avocation, not my vocation. I remember going to a guidance counselor that first week of college and looking through all the majors offered. There was a dance major, but I felt that my career options in dance were less stable than pre-med.</p>
<p>Two years later, I really wasn’t happy with my choice to follow pre-med. From dawn to dusk, I was stuck inside a concrete lab staring into a microscope, studying things that didn’t have much meaning to me. I wanted to learn about the people around me, not things I could barely see. I felt empty. Luckily, in order to fulfill my pre-med requirements, I took a literature class, and to my surprise I loved it! I was reading about exciting characters in various places and learning about how people think and live. At the end of term, the professor had a party for us all and asked each of us our major. When I told her I was pre-med, she laughed. She actually thought I was joking. She said that I didn’t strike her as the pre-med type and that I should come see her when I decided to switch majors.</p>
<p>Soon after, I made another visit to a guidance counselor and he gave me some great advice. He said that I needed to <strong>decide on my career by choosing something I like to do as much as eating ice cream</strong>. I wondered if I could choose my favorite subject ad still make a living, as I was stuck on the idea that college was about choosing a major that would lead to a definite job. He was trying to tell me that your passion could be your work. And a passionate and fulfilling life is definitely better than eating ice cream.</p>
<p>Eventually, I realized that no one was going to recommend dance as a career for me; if I wanted to dance, I was going to have to make it happen myself. I went to see my professors in the dance department and told them I wanted to go to graduate school in dance. I wanted to apply to the most incredible dance programs in the world. I purposely picked high-ranking graduate schools in order to test my abilities. If I got into tone of these schools it would confirm my gut feeling that I was talented enough to make it in the dance world. If I didn’t get into any of these schools, then I would choose another path.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, I was accepted to all the schools. I was shocked. My parents were even more shocked. I choose to go to the Laban Centre in London, where I was simultaneously enrolled in a professional dance diploma and master’s program. While enjoying my studies in London, I was advised that an M.F.A. degree from the United States has the greatest weight when applying for full-time teaching position at a college. So I came back to the U.S. and finished my M.F.A. degree at the California Institute of the Arts.</p>
<p>With my terminal degree in hand, I was still scared to declare dance as my livelihood. I sent out my resume to every community college in California, and worried that there might not be a job out there for me. I called up fellow alumni, who told me not to give up. I went to bookstores to research other career choices. Maybe I would make a good physical therapist? Yet, by mid-summer, I had job offers from two different colleges and was working with the California Arts Project.</p>
<p>Finally, one day while teaching movement to a group of non-dancers at a California Arts Project workshop, I finally embraced the reality that dance is a valuable and viable career choice. One of the students told me that he really appreciated my class because the idea of movement opened up a new way of seeing and appreciating himself and others around him. His words felt so good to me. I felt validated that I persevered through my doubts to find a career that expanded someone’s view of the world. I had made the right career choice.</p>
<p>After all my years of worrying, I have never had trouble finding a job in the dance world. Sometimes you have to piece a living together, but it is always more interesting and rewarding. I really love what I do, more than eating ice cream. <strong>Dance is necessary in our culture to teach people about their bodies, about the joy of movement and all movement means in the context of society and interpersonal relationships. Even if you do not find a job teaching dance, the education you will receive during the process of attaining a dance degree will be valuable in anything you do. Dance education teaches you about yourself, how you relate to others and how others relate to you. These are priceless skills in any career and in life.</strong></p>

<p>Dance Major and Career Options</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students and parents frequently struggle with the notion of majoring in dance instead of something they think might be “more practical.” The following section is designed to give you a broader perspective on the practicality of dance as an area of serious study.</p>

<li>“An education in the arts teaches students how to work cooperatively and how to work out conflicting points of view. Performing in a dance group is a cooperative activity that fosters team work—another characteristic that business values.”</li>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dance Education: Can I Make a Living?</span></strong></p>
<p>By: Stephanie Spencer</p>
<p>I have spent the last ten years of my life trying to convince myself, and those around me, that dance education is a viable career choice. Dance education is based on the comparison of how your body moves and feels in space and how others move and feel in space. Through dance education you can broaden your sense of self and awareness of others. It is the science of nonverbal communication; a language that is often overlooked or remains subconscious in our society. This language is a powerful tool in relating to yourself and the world around you. So, why did it take me so many years to convince myself that I could have a viable career teaching dance?</p>
<p>I started as a pre-medical student as an undergraduate because it seemed like an esteemed career choice. It did not occur to me that I could make a living with dance. I was told to make it my avocation, not my vocation. I remember going to a guidance counselor that first week of college and looking through all the majors offered. There was a dance major, but I felt that my career options in dance were less stable than pre-med.</p>
<p>Two years later, I really wasn’t happy with my choice to follow pre-med. From dawn to dusk, I was stuck inside a concrete lab staring into a microscope, studying things that didn’t have much meaning to me. I wanted to learn about the people around me, not things I could barely see. I felt empty. Luckily, in order to fulfill my pre-med requirements, I took a literature class, and to my surprise I loved it! I was reading about exciting characters in various places and learning about how people think and live. At the end of term, the professor had a party for us all and asked each of us our major. When I told her I was pre-med, she laughed. She actually thought I was joking. She said that I didn’t strike her as the pre-med type and that I should come see her when I decided to switch majors.</p>
<p>Soon after, I made another visit to a guidance counselor and he gave me some great advice. He said that I needed to <strong>decide on my career by choosing something I like to do as much as eating ice cream</strong>. I wondered if I could choose my favorite subject and still make a living, as I was stuck on the idea that college was about choosing a major that would lead to a definite job. He was trying to tell me that your passion could be your work. And a passionate and fulfilling life is definitely better than eating ice cream.</p>
<p>Eventually, I realized that no one was going to recommend dance as a career for me; if I wanted to dance, I was going to have to make it happen myself. I went to see my professors in the dance department and told them I wanted to go to graduate school in dance. I wanted to apply to the most incredible dance programs in the world. I purposely picked high-ranking graduate schools in order to test my abilities. If I got into one of these schools it would confirm my gut feeling that I was talented enough to make it in the dance world. If I didn’t get into any of these schools, then I would choose another path.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, I was accepted to all the schools. I was shocked. My parents were even more shocked. I choose to go to the Laban Centre in London, where I was simultaneously enrolled in a professional dance diploma and master’s program. While enjoying my studies in London, I was advised that an M.F.A. degree from the United States has the greatest weight when applying for full-time teaching position at a college. So I came back to the U.S. and finished my M.F.A. degree at the California Institute of the Arts.</p>
<p>With my terminal degree in hand, I was still scared to declare dance as my livelihood. I sent out my resume to every community college in California, and worried that there might not be a job out there for me. I called up fellow alumni, who told me not to give up. I went to bookstores to research other career choices. Maybe I would make a good physical therapist? Yet, by mid-summer, I had job offers from two different colleges and was working with the California Arts Project.</p>
<p>Finally, one day while teaching movement to a group of non-dancers at a California Arts Project workshop, I finally embraced the reality that dance is a valuable and viable career choice. One of the students told me that he really appreciated my class because the idea of movement opened up a new way of seeing and appreciating himself and others around him. His words felt so good to me. I felt validated that I persevered through my doubts to find a career that expanded someone’s view of the world. I had made the right career choice.</p>
<p>After all my years of worrying, I have never had trouble finding a job in the dance world. Sometimes you have to piece a living together, but it is always more interesting and rewarding. I really love what I do, more than eating ice cream. <strong>Dance is necessary in our culture to teach people about their bodies, about the joy of movement and all movement means in the context of society and interpersonal relationships. Even if you do not find a job teaching dance, the education you will receive during the process of attaining a dance degree will be valuable in anything you do. Dance education teaches you about yourself, how you relate to others and how others relate to you. These are priceless skills in any career and in life.</strong></p>

<p>Being a dancer isn’t just knowing how to leap to the sky and pirouette five times, it’s about being able to express yourself!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Why Major In Dance?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Muhlenberg dance majors were asked why they were majoring in dance. Here is what they had to say…</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a dancer first entering college, I thought I was well trained and knowledgeable about dance. Then, I found out there was so much more in the dance field than fine-tuning the movement of the body. Dancing also fine-tunes the mind and imagination in ways that few other majors in college do.</p>
<p>Jennifer Volk ‘00</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>When I came into Muhlenberg, I thought that by the time I graduated I’d be able to do five pirouettes, 32 fouettes on pointe, and have extension to my ear. After my first few ballet classes, I realized that I had many more important things to be working on.</li>
<li>As a result of the core courses in the major, you have a new understanding and appreciation for everything being taught to you in technique classes.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An education in dance is never wasted, given the discipline and communication skills that dancers learn from their studies.</p>
<p>Jenny Lifson ‘01</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>I learned to value my own opinion, but always to look to others for better ideas. I learned to learn and to teach. I learned to be patient. I learned to self-motivate. I learned to be forgiving.</li>
<li>Critical thinking, working with a team, the ability to work under time restraint, and the ability to articulate thoughts are just a few of the concepts practiced in dance theory courses. These abilities are invaluable for a person to thrive in the modern world.</li>
<li>It has opened me up, I am more willing to try something new and accept something different.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you are constantly asked to create, you are digging in deeper to who you really are. I know more about myself than I ever thought I would.</p>
<p>Tanya Nicklous ‘00</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>I’ve learned to question the information given to me, to always ask “WHY?” I’ve learned that the accepted way isn’t always the best way.</li>
<li>Critical thinking, organizing ideas, problem solving, leadership skills, communication, abstract thinking, and being able to give and receive feedback are a few skills learned while being a dance major.</li>
<li>I understand <em>my</em> anatomic structure and how to use it to <em>my</em> I know how to take information given to me by a teacher and to adapt it safely and most efficiently to <em>my</em> body.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A person can take dance technique class after dance technique class, and learn a lot about dance. But do they really understand what they are doing and why? Can they appreciate historical references when seeing works? Can they appreciate the process of choreography, its challenges and choices?</p>
<p>Beth Danton ‘00</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Learning about choreography and teaching opens you up to other job opportunities that I never thought I had.</li>
<li>I’ve noticed a huge difference in my personality since I first came here, and I attribute that to my dance courses. I’ve become much more outgoing, and for the first time, I feel like I’m able to speak in front of large groups of people. I feel that I can speak intelligently in group discussions and debates. I learned how to be a confident, informed speaker as a dance major.</li>
<li>To be able to spend time really learning about something you’ve always loved is an amazing opportunity, especially in the college environment.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>People ask what I’m going to “do” with a major in dance. Apparently they think that they only thing I can do is either teach or perform. I’m not worried because I feel prepared for anything. If I need to know more about a specific area, I know how to learn. Everyone in college chooses a specific major. Some majors teach you everything you need to know in that specific area, like how to get into medical school, or how to be a teacher. Other majors teach you all of the skills you need in that area, plus everything you need to know to excell at life. The dance major falls in the latter category. Everyone studies life, but we just choose which medium to use to get that information. Some people learn about life through student teaching, others through biology, or theatre, or literature. I learned life through dance! J</p>
