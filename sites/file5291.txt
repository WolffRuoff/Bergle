								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey there, this is Sophia here, your favorite Puerto Rican cast member.</p>
<p>More than ever this experience has pushed me in ways that I&#8217;ve never been pushed before. Not only am I having to do my own grocery shopping (which is actually so hard, wowza) but this show really pushes us to think hard about the work that we&#8217;re doing, the quotes we choose, and how it can best impact our audience. Our first goal is to speak to the freshman and get the word out about the truths of Muhlenberg, but whats also under the surface of that is how we can best represent Muhlenberg: what messages are we trying to send to not only the freshman in the audience, but the Muhlenberg staff and alumni as well? How can we inspire them to take what they&#8217;ve heard and weave it into the lives they&#8217;ll live on this campus?</p>
<p>The answer of this question should come from an audience member, sure I could answer this for someone, but if I really want to do the work correctly, then the answer should not be handed to them on a silver platter.</p>
<p>I am thrilled and honored to do this work, show week is right around the corner and while we may not be completely ready for the freshman, we&#8217;re definitely only getting more and more excited to meet them.</p>
<p>Cya soon,</p>
<p>Sophia</p>
