					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I could completely agree with what you are saying. With social media growing everyday it has become more addicting. I also find myself checking all my social media outlets that I have more and more everyday. I definitely agree that a lot of teens are the same way. Our generation is 100% more reliant on technology and the internet than other generations before us. However, what I find scary is that the generations below us are even more dependent on technology than us.&lt;/p&gt;
