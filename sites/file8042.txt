								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In chapter 4, <em>Personal Identity in the Age of the App</em>  by Gardner, H. &amp; Davis, K, depicts the difference between an online and an offline identity. A common saying is do not believe everything you see on the internet and I see this to be especially true when it comes to someones online identity. Social media these days is a place where many kids, especially those in high school go to share what might be happening in their lives. Whether it is sharing the great gifts they recently received, the awesome places they might be and in general how great things may be. At least that is what they want you to think. Most kids do not want to be an outsider, they do not want to be that one kid who is having a bad time or is depressed or just is not feeling how everyone else is. Everyone wants it to seem like they are doing just as well as everyone else and this is described by Molly in chapter 4, &#8220;On Facebook, people are more concerned with making it look like they&#8217;re living rather than actually living&#8221; (Gardner &amp; Davis 63).  You never really know what someone might be going through just by their social media accounts. People will hide behind the scene and make it seem like everything is okay. One of my friends was depressed for the longest time before anyone knew anything about it. Going by just her social media she would be the happiest and most fortunate girl you&#8217;ll know. However news came out that she was going through some problems and that is why the social media identity is not always accurate towards someones real identity. Be careful what you believe online, you might think someones life is perfect, however turns out you never really knew anything about them.</p>
