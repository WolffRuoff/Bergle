			<p>It would have been great to give this week&#8217;s award to someone other than Cody Geyer. The junior speedster on the Muhlenberg football team has already won twice.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/defense_dickinson.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2056" alt="defense" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/defense_dickinson.jpg" width="375" height="329" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/defense_dickinson.jpg 375w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/defense_dickinson-300x263.jpg 300w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/defense_dickinson-341x300.jpg 341w" sizes="(max-width: 375px) 100vw, 375px" /></a>It would have been really cool to give it to someone on the defense, which put on another stellar performance in the Mules&#8217; 42-3 win against Dickinson on Saturday. Playing against the third-leading rushing team in the Centennial Conference, the defense allowed only 80 yards on 45 carries.</p>
<p>In the second half, every Red Devil possession ended in a punt, and one only one of those drives did Muhlenberg allow a first down. Dickinson snapped the ball eight times on first down in the second half and gained a total of 4 yards. In the third quarter, the Red Devils ran 14 plays for 15 yards.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg&#8217;s defense has allowed only two offensive touchdowns during the team&#8217;s current four-game winning streak. In Division III, the Mules rank 22nd in pass efficiency defense, 23rd in total defense and 24th in scoring defense.</p>
<p>Here are some top defensive plays from the Dickinson game:</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/szelongsack.wmv">Stephen Szelong sack</a></p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/feasterINT.wmv">John Feaster interception</a></p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/deladesack.wmv">Greg DeLade sack</a></p>
<p>But the signature play of the game, yet again, belonged to Geyer. With zeroes on the scoreboard after each team had punted on its first two possessions, Nick Palladino lofted a second-down pass down the left sideline, dropping it in perfectly beyond the cornerback and the safety, who was late in getting over. Geyer caught it in stride and raced into the end zone to complete the 62-yard play.</p>
<p>Geyer would add touchdowns on the Mules&#8217; next two possessions, and Muhlenberg rolled to an impressive win.</p>
<p>Here it is, the play of the week: <a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/11/Geyer62TD.wmv">Cody Geyer 62-yard touchdown</a></p>

<p>Scoring two goals in your last home game on Senior Day is pretty sweet. But it&#8217;s even sweeter when the goals help your team to a win that clinches a playoff berth. Graetzer helped extend her career and her teammates&#8217; season with two goals in a 4-0 shutout of Bryn Mawr. She broke a 0-0 tie just before halftime and scored again with about 16 minutes left for her second career multiple-goal game.</p>

<p>One of several worthy candidates from the Mules&#8217; 42-3 win against Dickinson, Palladino had a quarterback rating of 257.3, completing 15 of 18 passes for 255 yards and three touchdowns while playing only one series into the second half. The first Mule quarterback to throw two 50-yard touchdown passes in a game since 2001, the freshman also ran for a touchdown.</p>

			<p><em>Two Muhlenberg teams will be competing for the Centennial Conference championships, two others have already qualified to do so, and two more will try to play their way in. Plus, football&#8217;s Homecoming and the start of winter sports.</em></p>
<p><strong>Cross Country at McDaniel for Centennial Conference Championships (Saturday, 11:00 and 12:00)</strong></p>
<p>The Mules will face strong competition at the conference meet, including several nationally ranked teams in both the men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s races. Last year, the women finished fourth and the men fifth.</p>
<p>Complete preview: <a href="http://www.muhlenberg.edu/main/athletics/fall13/1031.html">http://www.muhlenberg.edu/main/athletics/fall13/1031.html</a></p>

<p><strong>Volleyball vs. Swarthmore (Saturday, 12:00); vs. Moravian (Saturday, 4:00)</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg (18-10, 7-2) hosts two important matches &#8211; for different reasons &#8211; on the final day of the regular season. The Mules have clinched a CC playoff berth and can land a bye to the semifinals (where they would face McDaniel) if they can beat Swarthmore (15-11, 3-6). A loss could drop Muhlenberg to the 4-5 match, which it would host on Wednesday.</p>
<p>In the second match, the Mules will be playing for school pride (and possibly its first 20-win season since 2001) against a 10-20 Greyhound squad that had lost nine in a row heading into a Friday night match. Moravian took a 3-2 lead in the Matte Award race with a women&#8217;s soccer win on Wednesday, and the volleyball team has a chance to even the standings up.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg trails the all-time series against both Swarthmore (17-16) and Moravian (40-9) and has lost five straight to both.</p>
<p>Live stats (both Muhlenberg matches): <a href="http://www.muhlenberg.edu/sports/vblive/topview.htm">http://www.muhlenberg.edu/sports/vblive/topview.htm</a></p>
<p><strong>Football vs. Dickinson (Saturday, 1:00)</strong></p>
<p>Although it&#8217;s Family Weekend at Muhlenberg, it&#8217;s homecoming weekend for the football team, which has not played a home game in almost a month. The Mules (5-2, 4-2) have won each of their last three games by at least 20 points and will look to continue their roll.</p>
<p>Dickinson (3-4, 3-3) has the third-best rushing attack in the CC and attempted only seven passes in last week&#8217;s 38-31 win against McDaniel. But the Devils&#8217; starting quarterback, who ranks second among CC QBs in rushing yards, was injured last week. Muhlenberg is second in the CC against the run, allowing only 114.4 yards per game.</p>
<p>The Mules lead the all-time series, 41-25-2, and have taken 12 of the last 14 meetings, including a 61-21 win last year and a 12-0 shutout in the snow two years ago.</p>

<p><strong>Women&#8217;s Soccer vs. Bryn Mawr (Saturday, 1:00)</strong></p>
<p>Despite losing four in a row, Muhlenberg (6-10-1, 4-5) can clinch a CC playoff berth for the second straight year by defeating Bryn Mawr in its regular-season finale. If the Mules win, they will travel to either McDaniel or Dickinson for a first-round game on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Owls (2-14, 0-9) are winless in their last 17 CC contests and have scored only four goals all season, but they recently snapped a 13-game losing streak with an overtime win against Moravian, a team Muhlenberg just lost to.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg has won 19 straight meetings against Bryn Mawr to take a 20-2 series lead. The Owls have been shut out in their last eight trips to Allentown, dating back to 1996.</p>

<p><strong>Field Hockey vs. Haverford (Saturday, 6:00)</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg (8-8, 6-3) is in the CC playoffs for the first time since 2007 and, unless nationally ranked Ursinus unexpectedly loses to last-place Swarthmore, will face Haverford in a first-round game on Wednesday. The winner of this contest will get to host the rematch.</p>
<p>The Fords (9-7, 5-4) have clinched their fifth straight playoff berth; they reached the CC championship game in 2010 and last year. A Mule defense that is second in the CC in fewest goals allowed in league games (11) faces a Haverford offense has scored 14 goals in its last three games.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg leads the all-time series, 15-11, but Haverford has won four of the last five meetings.</p>

<p><strong>Men&#8217;s Soccer at McDaniel (Saturday, 3:30)</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg (8-7-1, 3-4-1) needs a win and lots of help to make the CC playoffs. But in such a competitive league, almost every game is close and anything is possible.</p>
<p>First and foremost, the Mules must defeat last-place McDaniel (7-6-3, 1-5-2). The Green Terror started off the season with five straight wins, earned a regional ranking and was 6-1-3 a month ago but has lost five of its last six.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg leads the all-time series, 32-7-1, and has never lost to McDaniel: The Mules&#8217; last series loss came in 2001 when the school was still known as Western Maryland. In 11 meetings since, Muhlenberg is 10-0-1 with a 18-1 scoring margin.</p>

			<p><strong>Male Play of the Week &#8211; Cody Geyer, Football</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s not long before this weekly feature will be renamed the Cody Geyer Film Festival. The junior wide receiver made another spectacular, impactful play in the football team&#8217;s 27-7 win at Juniata on Saturday.</p>
<p>The Mules had a good first half offensively but were held to three total points on consecutive long second-quarter drives inside the 15-yard line, and the Eagles had a chance to go into the locker room down by less than a touchdown and due to get the ball to start the second half.</p>
<p>After the defense forced a punt, Muhlenberg regained possession on its own 36 with 1:18 to go in the half. On third-and-10, Joe Carlucci threw a 15-yard pass to Geyer, who spun out of a tackle and was off to the races.</p>
<p>Instead of 13-7, Juniata was now down 20-7 and never recovered. The Eagles didn&#8217;t get inside the Mule 35 the rest of the game, and Geyer added a 10-yard touchdown run in the third quarter to cap the scoring.</p>
<p>Click for video of the 64-yard touchdown play (with the 10-yard run added as a bonus): <a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/10/geyer_juniata.wmv">Cody Geyer vs. Juniata</a></p>
<p>Geyer has made a play of at least 60 yards in three straight games.</p>
<p><strong>Female Play of the Week &#8211; Kayleigh Thies, Field Hockey<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Geyer has some company this week in another player with a knack for making big plays &#8211; junior Kayleigh Thies of the field hockey team.</p>
<p>The second-leading scorer in the Centennial Conference was involved in three of Muhlenberg&#8217;s five goals last week, and in two come-from-behind wins in which the Mules led for only 20 of 160 minutes, they were all important.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg had a big advantage in shots against Widener but was tied 1-1 before Thies ended the game five minutes into double overtime. Emily Boyle started the winning play by setting up Thies on a breakaway, but the goalie came out to break up the shot attempt. The ball came back out to Boyle, who again fed Thies for the winner.</p>
<p>Against 15th-ranked Ursinus, the Mules trailed 2-0 before Thies changed the momentum with a goal in the final minute of the first half. She dribbled around a defender off a penalty corner and blasted the ball in with just 44.5 seconds on the clock.</p>
<p>Early in the second half, Thies passed to Boyle for the tying goal on a breakaway. An own goal eight minutes later proved to be the difference in the 3-2 upset win.</p>

<p>Thies, also named Centennial Conference player of the week, recorded two goals and an assist &#8211; all important ones &#8211; in a pair of one-goal wins for the Mules. After netting the game-winning goal in double overtime against Widener, she scored one goal and assisted on the other as Muhlenberg came back from a 2-0 deficit against nationally ranked Ursinus. The Mules went on to win, 3-2, to clinch a CC playoff berth.</p>

<p>These guys &#8211; left tackle <strong>Willie Britt</strong>, left guard <strong>Rob Municchi</strong>, center <strong>Andrew Kincaid</strong>, right guard <strong>Tommy DeVito</strong> and right tackle <strong>Bryan Auvil</strong> &#8211; are usually anonymous, but they deserve recognition for their play in the Mules&#8217; 27-7 win at Juniata. Muhlenberg set a school record by running 97 plays, and the line did not allow a sack against a Juniata defense that came in tied for ninth in Division III in sacks per game. The Mules controlled the clock for nearly 40 minutes (39:51), converted 14 of 23 third downs and had five drives of 10 plays or more.</p>

			<p>When Nick Palladino took over as Muhlenberg’s starting quarterback, it didn’t take “long” for him to establish who his favorite target was. Michael Long snagged eight passes against McDaniel in Palladino’s first career start and has caught at least four in every game since.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/10/long_juniata1.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2010" alt="Michael Long" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/10/long_juniata1.jpg" width="241" height="444" /></a>But the freshman quarterback and junior tight end took their connection to a new, historic level yesterday.</p>
<p>Long set a Centennial Conference record for catches by a tight end with 11 receptions for 114 yards in the Mules’ 27-7 win at Juniata. The previous mark was 10, set by Matt Knouse of Susquehanna vs. Wilkes two years ago. No CC tight end had ever reached double digits in receptions in a league game.</p>
<p>“It feels great,” said Long of breaking the record. “It’s ironic that it was 11 catches and I’m number 11.</p>
<p>“We were just running the same usual plays. They were just working better and better, and we kept going to them over and over again.”</p>
<p>They might have been usual plays, but the results were far from ordinary. Of Long’s 11 catches (10 from Palladino and one from Joe Carlucci), eight went for first downs, including five on third down and one on fourth down. Here’s a rundown of the record 11 receptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>first and 10 – 12 yards, first down (first play of game)</li>
<li>third and 12 – 19 yards, first down</li>
<li>first and 10 – 4 yards</li>
<li>third and 2 – 4 yards, first down</li>
<li>third and 4 – 11 yards, first down</li>
<li>third and 8 – 14 yards, first down</li>
<li>third and 2 – 5 yards, first down</li>
<li>fourth and 3 – 21 yards, first down</li>
<li>second and 18 – 3 yards</li>
<li>second and 6 – 12 yards, first down</li>

<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/10/long_juniata2.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2009" alt="Michael Long" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/10/long_juniata2.jpg" width="340" height="363" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/10/long_juniata2.jpg 340w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/10/long_juniata2-280x300.jpg 280w" sizes="(max-width: 340px) 100vw, 340px" /></a>Seven of the catches came on scoring drives, and another was in a drive that ended on a missed field goal.</p>
<p>Long, who leads Muhlenberg and is tied for fourth in the CC with 36 receptions, was the first Mule tight end to record a 100-yard receiving game since All-American Matt Johnson in 2007. With at least three games left, Long is within striking distance of Johnson’s CC and school tight end record of 54 catches in a season – especially if he has another day like yesterday.</p>
<p>Long’s productivity helped the Mules convert 14 of 23 third downs, hold the ball for almost 40 minutes and set a school record with 97 plays. And even when he wasn’t catching the ball, he was blocking for an offensive line that controlled the line of scrimmage.</p>
<p>“He can block, he can catch, he can run. He does it all,” said classmate Cody Geyer, who combined with Long to give Muhlenberg two 100-yard receivers for the first time since 2004. “It’s great to have a guy like that that the quarterback can rely on.</p>
<p>“He came in as a starter as a freshman, and he just keeps improving. I’d put him up there as one of the best, if not the best, tight ends in the conference.”</p>

<p><strong>Field Hockey vs. Ursinus (Saturday, 1:00)</strong></p>
<p>Pink will be all around in the only home event of the weekend as the Mules raise money for the National Foundation for Cancer Research. The game will be played with a pink ball, and Play4theCure bracelets and t-shirts will be sold.</p>
<p><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/10/fhplay4pink.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2002" alt="Play 4 Pink" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/10/fhplay4pink.jpg" width="500" height="219" srcset="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/10/fhplay4pink.jpg 500w, http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/10/fhplay4pink-300x131.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>Although Muhlenberg (7-7, 5-3) is in hot pursuit of a CC playoff berth, this isn&#8217;t the key game it might seem to be. Win or lose, the Mules (barring an unexpected result elsewhere) will still have to defeat Haverford in next Saturday&#8217;s regular-season finale to nail down the playoff spot. A win would put Muhlenberg in better position to host a first-round game, and it would also give the Mules a strong confidence boost.</p>
<p>Easier said than done. Ursinus (11-3, 7-1) is ranked 15th in Division III and is coming off a 4-3 win against ninth-ranked TCNJ. The Bears&#8217; only two Division III losses are by one goal to the teams ranked sixth and seventh, and they are second in the country in scoring, averaging five goals per game.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg beat Ursinus in the first meeting between the two schools in 1980 but is still looking for its second series win. Although the Bears have won all 11 meetings since joining the CC in 2003, the last two games (both 2-1) were close.</p>

<p><strong>Football at Juniata (Saturday, 12:00)</strong></p>
<p>This is a very different Juniata squad from the one the Mules have defeated handily every year since the teams became CC foes in 2007. The Eagles, who won a total of 10 games the last nine years, are 4-2 and poised for their first non-losing season since 2002.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg (4-2, 3-2) comes in with a hot defense, having allowed only one offensive touchdown in the last two games, and will face a hot quarterback in Ward Udinski, who accounts for 75 percent of the Juniata offense. The three-time CC player of the week was responsible for all four touchdowns in a 28-7 win against previously undefeated Ursinus last week, and stopping him will be of paramount importance for the Mules.</p>
<p>In its last two games, Muhlenberg has used a long punt return by Cody Geyer to grab the momentum, and the Eagles are vulnerable in that area &#8211; they&#8217;re allowing a CC-worst 17.5 yards per punt return. The Mule offense, meanwhile, has scored at least 30 points in eight of its last 11 regular-season games. Juniata is second in the CC in sacks but gives up 28.0 points per game.</p>

<p><strong>Men&#8217;s Soccer at Ursinus (Saturday, 12:00)</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg (7-7-1, 2-4-1) is in dire need of a win to keep its CC playoff hopes alive. Ursinus (7-7-1, 3-3-1) has been one of the surprises teams in the CC this year, posting wins against nationally ranked Dickinson and Franklin &amp; Marshall and tying nationally ranked Swarthmore earlier in the season. The Bears have tailed off a little, however, dropping three of their last four CC games.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg leads the all-time series, 47-10-5, and is 19-0-1 against Ursinus since the start of CC play in 1993. The Bears haven&#8217;t defeated the Mules since 1984.</p>

<p><strong>Women&#8217;s Soccer at Ursinus (Saturday, 3:00)</strong></p>
<p>The Mules (6-8-1, 4-4) are tied for fourth place in the CC and can clinch a home playoff game for the second straight year by winning their final two games &#8211; this one, and a home contest against Bryn Mawr (1-13, 0-8) next Saturday. A loss or a tie in Collegeville could lead to Muhlenberg missing the playoffs entirely.</p>
<p>Ursinus (6-8-1, 2-5-1) is out of the playoff picture and hasn&#8217;t won at home since August 30. But the Bears have three one-goal losses and a tie against playoff contenders, and they also lost by just one goal to regionally ranked Scranton.</p>
<p>Last year, Muhlenberg posted a 1-0 win at Ursinus in the final game of the regular season to clinch a home playoff game. The Mules lead the series, 14-6, but the Bears have won six of the last 11 meetings, and the last four were all decided by one goal.</p>

<p><strong>Volleyball at E-town October Classic: vs. Elizabethtown (Saturday, 2:00); vs. Penn State Altoona or Stevens (Saturday, 4:00)</strong></p>
<p>A playoff berth already in the bag, the Mules (17-8) take a break from CC play to compete in a four-team tournament. Host Elizabethtown is 15-12, while Penn State Altoona is 14-10 and Stevens is 22-5 and ranked second in the New York Region by the NCAA.</p>

<p>Alston came into the week with no goals on the season and only one in her four-year career but scored two big ones to help the Mules to a pair of important road wins. She scored late in the first half to break a scoreless tie in an eventual 3-0 win at Swarthmore. Two days later, after Gettysburg had stunned Muhlenberg with a goal just 2:11 into the game, Alston answered by netting the equalizer only 1:45 later, and the Mules went on to win, 3-2.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/10/onimushs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1987" alt="Andrew Onimus" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2013/10/onimushs.jpg" width="100" height="150" /></a>Male Athlete of the Week &#8211; Andrew Onimus, Football</strong></p>
<p>Onimus led a Mule defense that stymied a potent Gettysburg offense in a 35-10 win on Saturday. The Bullets came in ranked in the top 10 in Division III in total yards but were held to 295 thanks in large part to the play of Muhlenberg&#8217;s senior cornerback. He recorded a team-leading 13 tackles (11 solo), including two for loss, and he also broke up a pass. In a second-half stretch in which the Mules pulled away, Onimus made two third-down stops two yards short of a first down and also broke up a third-down pass.</p>

<p><strong>Field Hockey at Gettysburg (Friday, 3:30)</strong></p>
<p>The Mules have it all in front of them as they seek to earn a postseason berth. Muhlenberg (5-7, 4-3) and Gettysburg (8-4, 3-3) are tied in the loss column (along with 3-3 Haverford) for fourth place in the Centennial Conference, two games behind third-place Ursinus. The last three CC opponents for the Mules? Gettysburg, Haverford and Ursinus.</p>
<p>Gettysburg is second in the CC in scoring, averaging 3.8 goals per game, and has scored at least four in every game of its current five-game winning streak. Muhlenberg has allowed only 12 goals in its last 10 games, with three shutouts in the last four.</p>
<p>Gettysburg leads the all-time series, 17-6, and has won the last five meetings since Muhlenberg&#8217;s 2-1 overtime victory in the last game of the 2007 regular season. Three of those five games were decided by one goal.</p>

<p><strong>Volleyball vs. Gettysburg (Saturday, 12:00); vs. St. Lawrence (Saturday, 4:00)</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg (15-7, 5-1) and Gettysburg (12-10, 5-1) are tied for second place in the CC. If Johns Hopkins beats Haverford Friday night, that will become a three-way tie. The Mules have won nine of their last 11 matches, while the Bullets bring in a three-match winning streak.</p>
<p>Gettysburg holds a 26-2 series lead. The Mules’ lone wins came in their two playoff seasons. In 2001, they defeated the Bullets in the regular season but lost to them in the CC championship match, and in 2009, they pulled out a five-set win in the regular-season finale.</p>
<p>The second match has less riding on it but is interesting for the fact that Muhlenberg will take on St. Lawrence (located in Canton, N.Y., near the Candadian border) exactly one week after facing Millsaps (located in Jackson, Miss.). To drive from one school to the other would take about 22 hours.</p>

<p><strong>Women&#8217;s Soccer vs. Gettysburg (Saturday, 1:00)</strong></p>
<p>Even though the Mules (6-7-1, 4-3) lost to Swarthmore on Wednesday night, they should be in good position for a playoff berth if they can win two of their last three games. The first one won&#8217;t be easy: Gettysburg (10-1-3, 5-1-1) has outscored its opponents by a 31-5 margin this year and received two votes in this week&#8217;s D3soccer.com poll.</p>
<p>Gettysburg holds a 15-7-2 series lead and has won the last three meetings, all by shutout. Muhlenberg’s last series win was a 2-1 home victory in 2009.</p>

<p><strong>Men&#8217;s Soccer vs. Johns Hopkins (Saturday, 7:00)</strong></p>
<p>Far and away the top two programs in the 21-year history of the CC, Muhlenberg (7-5-1, 2-2-1) and Johns Hopkins (5-6-2, 2-2-1) are two of the five teams in a logjam in the middle of the CC standings. The Mules, playing their final home game of the season, are coming off a stretch in which they went 3-1-1 while playing four teams that were regionally ranked at the time of the game.</p>
<p>These two teams are no strangers to each other. The Blue Jays lead 15-10-4 in a series that includes eight postseason meetings. All but one of the Mules’ 10 wins have come in Allentown, including a 2-0 shutout last year.</p>

<p><strong></strong><strong>Football at Gettysburg (Saturday, 1:00)</strong></p>
<p>All 10 CC teams return to action after the league-wide bye, and Muhlenberg will try to repeat its second-half effort of last year, when it averaged 40.0 points a game in winning its last five regular-season contests.</p>
<p>On the surface, it looks like the Mules (3-2, 2-2) have a good chance to put up a lot of points against a Gettysburg (3-2, 2-2) defense that is allowing 35.0 points and 504.2 yards per game. But Muhlenberg, which is averaging 37.8 points per game, has had notorious trouble offensively at the Battlefield, scoring only 30 points in its last four visits.</p>
<p>Gettysburg leads the all-time series, 43-33-1, but Muhlenberg has won 10 of the last 13 meetings.</p>

<p>This will be the first race in two weeks for the men&#8217;s team and the first in nearly a month for the women. For both teams, it will be the final tuneup for the November 2 CC Championship meet.</p>
<p><strong>Men&#8217;s Golf at RU-Camden Scarlet Raptors Fall Invitational (Friday, 12:30)</strong></p>
<p>Muhlenberg closes out its fall season with a trip to South Jersey. Last month, Rutgers-Camden won the Muhlenberg Invitational.</p>

<p>With the Mules trailing 5-0 six minutes into the second quarter and desperately needing a spark, Geyer provided it, racing 82 yards from the Muhlenberg 10 to the Susquehanna 8 to set up the game&#8217;s first touchdown two plays later. The Mules closed out the half on a 17-0 run and went on to win, 38-18.</p>
<p>Geyer set a school record in the game by averaging 35.0 yards on four punt returns, and he was named Centennial Conference special teams player of the week.</p>

<p>The football win was one of several successful results for the Mules over the weekend. Field hockey, volleyball and men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s soccer all defeated Washington College and men&#8217;s cross country won a 42-team race, making for a near-perfect weekend, even if the weather was less than ideal for this time of year.</p>
