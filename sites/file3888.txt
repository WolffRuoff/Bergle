<p>Hoping to interest a new target audience, WMBC New York executives created the 60-minute news program <em>LX New York</em>, which airs daily at 5:00 pm. At first, ratings were less than impressive. As a result, the creators decided to implement some key changes to the show&#8217;s format. These changes were linked to another decision: WMBC executives decided to specifically target suburban women.  To increase show ratings and appeal to these viewers, <em>LX New York</em> started utilizing the city more.  For example, the show began airing cooking segments filmed on the city streets and in local restaurants instead of in the studio. The new and improved <em>LX New York</em> also features celebrity interviews, cooking segments,news snippets, and a topic of the day.</p>
<p><span id="more-823"></span>Additionally, executives brought on a new host, former news anchor Jane Hanson.  By serving as a familiar face, Hanson comes with her own fans, thus, brings more viewers to<em> LX New York</em>.  Producers also created a social media campaign, which included an online, live viewer chat about the show. Specifically, the online resources and viewer chats act as a linking pin for <em>LX New York</em>, an example of a symbiotic relationship between television and internet. Most importantly,the live chats provide a sense of community for fans, forming personal ties and relationship to the show while also providing feedback to producers.  That way, both audiences and producers benefit and gain a sense of power.<br />

However, WMCS and viewers are not the only parties benefitting from the revamped <em>LX New York</em>.  A unique way the show presents its advertisers is through integration into segments, which would not be done in a newscast. For instance, the grocery store chain, Fairway, has sponsored cooking bits. This unique kind of advertising is enticing for advertisers since the product is actually integrated into the program, as opposed to using commercials, which can be bypassed.  This is especially relevant in the age of changing television exhibition, with technologies such as Tivo allowing viewers to simply fast-forward through commercials.</p>
<p>Competitors are thrilled with WMBC’s New York’s change because the new program does not target a news audience anymore, even though it is running during a timeslot traditionally reserved for news programs.  Of course, if the show does too well, it could spawn imitators, which could lead to the replacement of serious news with soft entertainment—a potentially dangerous transition for a democratic society that relies on an informed citizenry.</p>
