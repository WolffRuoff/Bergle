Why, some people questioned, didn&#8217;t the Library know it had these books?<\/p>\n<p>Daniel Stuhlman, a librarian and researcher\u00a0at Wright\u00a0College in Chicago, was skeptical that any library would not know what was in its own collection, so he went to the Library&#8217;s website and did the obvious: he checked the catalog.<\/p>\n<p>Sure enough, there were the Jefferson books, fully cataloged with\u00a0added entries\u00a0to indicate that they were once owned by Thomas Jefferson and were donated to WU&#8217;s Special Collections by Jefferson&#8217;s granddaughter in 1880. Several of the titles even\u00a0had notes that they are included in <em>Catalog: President Jefferson&#8217;s Library <\/em>(1829), which is\u00a0widely available\u00a0on Google Books.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, WU&#8217;s Library holdings are available on WorldCat, so anyone doing a search for these items would have been able to find them had they been interested.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>So is this story is really a non-story? Actually, no. Most libraries have what are sometimes called &#8220;hidden collections&#8221; that are generally in Rare Books or Special Collections. These items tend to lurk unnoticed until a researcher takes a particular interest in them. In the case of the Jefferson books, the donation\u00a0was made 130 years ago and the librarians who accepted and cataloged the donation are long gone. In time, the books sank into the hidden collections.<\/p>\n<p>The challenge for libraries is to raise the profiles of hidden collections by\u00a0reassessing them and finding ways to alert the public to their value. A starting point is to enhance catalog records so that the hidden items can be found more easily using the library&#8217;s own catalog and WorldCat.<\/p>\n<p>Another step may be to take advantage of the &#8220;Google-ization&#8221; of research to create digital repositories for hidden collections with links to the library&#8217;s catalog.<\/p>\n<p>The Trexler Library has its own hidden collections of tremendous value, including its Pennsylvania German Collection, the Ray R. Brennan Map Collection, the late 2nd Century Greek manuscripts known as the Oxyrhynchus papyri.<\/p>\n<p>Hidden treasures are everywhere&#8211;all you need to do is to check the catalog!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This week\u00a0there was a great deal of excitement following an AP story\u00a0about the &#8220;discovery&#8221; of &#8220;lost&#8221; books owned by Thomas Jefferson in Washington University&#8217;s Special Collections.
