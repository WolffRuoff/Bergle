								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As we may be aware of, society plays a big role in how the people within that society perceive the world, and therefore the people around them, and how they behave towards those people. In the context of teaching in the U.S., we are prone to societal factors (ie. gender, race, socioeconomic status, and teacher’s level of teaching experience) that influence the ways we teach students. And as research shows, these factors act as moderators in assessing childhood disorders , which could have negative implications in the classroom.</p>
<p>For example, a literature review on the familial role in the development, treatment, and prevention of childhood anxiety disorders showed that “higher levels of parent overcontrol were more strongly related to female gender for the child, higher socioeconomic status, school-aged children, and discussion tasks” (Drake &amp; Ginsburg, 2012). Meaning, parents tend to be more controlling over children if the child has the factors mentioned above. And if we take a closer look at gender, society teaches us -through television, social media, religious place of worship, peer interactions, and so forth- that we should fit into a certain gender and think, perceive, and act in ways that correlate with the assigned gender. In the case of the review, anxiety is induced or exacerbated in a child by the parent controlling (physically and verbally) the behaviors of a girl, because of what the U.S. has taught us about how to dress, act towards particular kinds of men, and play if the child is perceived as a girl.</p>
<p>How does this translate into the classroom? Teachers often exhibit the same kind of over-controlling on students who are girls (ie. telling them to sit a certain way in a seat or at their desk, encouraging them to play with other girls in the classroom, closely watching the girl when around boys), especially if they are diagnosed with a child disorder like Autism Spectrum Disorder or Conduct Disorder, because they are perceived to be or should be ladylike, have better control over emotions as opposed to boys, and be less deviant from the “normal” group of students.</p>
<p>On a different end, my peers and I have observed in our service learning placements that there are more boys than girls in the support classrooms (Autism spectrum or Emotional support). Why are more boys diagnosed with autism? In what ways do boys act that exhibit autism? Or is it the perception of what it means to be a boy that leads the diagnosis? How are they treated differently from girls? Girls with autism? What are some behaviors teachers show towards boys that could influence or reiterate the lack of emotion regulation in boys? These are questions we considered in our discussions and I recommend teachers should as well.</p>
<p>It is important to consider such factors when teaching, because the way we teach matters and strongly influences the behaviors and psyche of a child. Actions exhibited elicit certain child behaviors. Words said and in what order change the child’s point of view. And since children spend just as much time at home at school, if not more, the effects can be deep, pervasive, and long lasting. So questioning our world views and how they shape our teaching, changing how we teach, and teaching and caring for each student with respect to their own personality, ways of learning, and behaviors without the bias of things like gender and race, can make for better humans of the future.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anxiety disorder is hard to diagnose due to its &#8220;hidden&#8221; nature and its ambiguity to those who spend the most time around a child, so most parents and teachers will not notice that their child has symptoms associated with anxiety. The differentiation between the many anxiety disorders is difficult, due to the fact that everyone has a natural anxious response to threats.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When diagnosing anxiety, one of the things clinicians will look at is the hereditary aspect of anxiety. Biological vulnerability to anxiety means that there is an increased risk for formation of an anxiety disorder, when someone has anxiety in the family. This can be explained by increased risk of anxiety to children who have parents who have higher alertness and hypervigilance to their surroundings. I think that understanding that immediate family with anxiety correlates and suggests predispositions for anxiety is really important because it can help us prevent and be aware of warning signs early on in a child’s development. Additionally, anxiety can be a result of overly structured family life (Barrett, Rapee, Dadds, &amp; Ryan 1996), such that “high anxiety in a child is significantly related to frequent negative feedback and parental restriction.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In my outside research, I have found that some specified anxiety disorders are more likely to be considered hereditary than others. Specifically, Torgersen (1983), explains that heredity does not seem to be such a large influencer for generalized anxiety disorder in comparison with other anxiety disorders (panic disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder) or psychiatric disorders. Moreover, the researchers also explains that the interaction between the environment in which one develops and their biology is critical in understanding anxiety disorder. Though, the study doesn’t have enough evidence to draw conclusions. Knowing the effects and contributions that environments can impose on the development of anxiety for children is important, because then it can be controlled and monitored. </span></p>
