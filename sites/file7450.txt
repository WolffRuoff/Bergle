								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I found Jim Grooms presentation incredibly eye opening. I had no idea that the government had that much access to our personal information. At first I did not think it was a big deal that they had our information. The reason I thought this was because for safety reasons if I have to give up a certain amount of privacyÂ  it is okay. However when I saw the pizza phone call that is when I completely changed my mind. I found it completely invasive and dangerous that this is the direction we are headed with all of our personal information. Jim Grooms also said how the internet also views you as a series of data points. This means that they do not even care about you as an individual and view you more as a statistic. Following up on this topic advertising companies do the same thing. While you might think you are getting a free social media account they are actually selling all of your information to advertising companies. The assumption is that everything is completely free however you sacrifice your privacy. You are basically exchanging your privacy for free accounts.</p>
<p>Like I mentioned in my previous paragraph I never understood the problem with having people view my information. Now I understand the problem that this could potentially have on us in the future. I would have never have guessed that big social media accounts made their money by selling our information to advertising companies. I find this a complete invasion of privacy. Especially so because some social media accounts give the appearance of your profile being private. For example my status on Instagram is private. I thought this would give me control over who views my information. However, I now know that my information is being sold to advertising companies.</p>
