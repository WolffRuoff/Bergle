								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The benefits of reading are endless. It’s like trying to count the stars in the sky on a summer night. I’ll start with what’s most vital. Empathy. The ability to comprehend and share the feelings of an individual. According to Hanski (2014, p. 2), one positive impact of reading includes “Cultivating a so-called theory of mind, when one reads thoughts and feelings of people.” As meaningless as that may sound, the facts are there.</p>
<p>It’s proven that reading can better assist one to put him/herself in the position of another. Which ultimately, improves learning and being able to understand where one is coming from. But how? Your brain becomes accustomed to real situations. Understanding how someone feels is a great quality to have. It makes it easier to give advice, solve problems or simply just work it out. For example, every day can’t be a good one for everyone. Our body language and how we express ourselves are key signs to finding out someone’s mood. A lot of the time one doesn’t feel obligated to help that person and casually moves on with their day without trying to help. The more I see this ignorance happen, the more I feel I should step in and help. I hate being selfish and I dislike others who are selfish. The bottom line is that reading can help one another understand each other’s problems. So what? Without this important quality, nobody would be able to develop close bonds and more people would feel left out or lonely. Therefore, reading has the power make the world a better place.</p>
<p>Interestingly, recent studies have found that people who read excessively understand the world more. In the article, Hanski (2014, p. 2) states, “Books can infinitely expand your general view of this world.” This got me thinking. Could you imagine what the world be like if there was no method of communicating? People wouldn’t be raised, learn where they came from or develop friendships with one another. Life would be one big mystery.</p>
<p>Any sort of reading helps the mind. In the article, Hanski (2014, p. 2) revealed that reading lots in one’s early days could make one live longer. This is interesting because one doesn’t normally see reading as a way of staying healthy. It turns out reading plays a major role in keeping the brain active. It does so by continuously interpreting and evaluating. This struck me as ironic because most medications made to stabilize one’s health costs large sums of money, and reading is free and nearly everyone can be entertained by picking up a book.</p>
<p>Although many presume writing can be improved by learning different techniques and fixing a few grammar tweaks, the truth begs otherwise. Everyone’s writing tells a different story. Each and every person has been through diverse experiences that differentiate one from another. Consequently everyone conveys information in a way that feels natural to them. But one thing is for sure. Writing always has room to grow. Hanski (2014, p. 1) repeatedly brings up the idea of how reading can improve your writing thereafter. For example, Hanski (2014, p. 2) wrote the phrase “to learn more, keep reading.” I believe the message here is clear that every time we read something, whether it be a lengthy book or a short statement, we as humans learn from it. Reading helps people adapt to changes, learn from our mistakes in addition to help our brain learn right from wrong. There’s nothing in this world that enables one’s mindset to grow, more than reading.</p>
<p>Depending on what stage you’re at in life, the benefit of reading varies. For some it may be an eye opener as to who they truly are. For another it may teach a life lesson or further develop your character. Others will notice reading helps boost their self-esteem and remove stress. And lastly, it may expand your knowledge on a particular subject or add to your vocabulary. Clearly, a little reading has the potential to go a long way. The way people adjust to these assistances make them who they are. Whether physical or psychological, reading will improve your state in ways you don’t even realize. It will pave an upward pathway for one’s life, open up new opportunities and enlighten you with inspiration you didn’t have before.</p>
