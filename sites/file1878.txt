<p>We’re excited to share that we’ll be transitioning to G Suite’s newest collaboration product, Google Chat. Chat has a modern UI (user interface), rooms that support better collaboration, emoji reactions to make communication fun, and bots to help you be more productive, and much more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Transitioning to Google Chat provides great new features, such as an upgraded Gmail integration and the ability to chat with external users.</p>



<p><strong>Beginning this Monday, July 20, everyone will use Chat </strong>for 1:1 direct messages (DMs), group messages, and team discussions. Classic Hangouts apps will be turned off.</p>



<p><strong>How do I get Google Chat? It&#8217;s important to do the following before July 20 as Classic Hangout apps will stop working:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Explore the new Web experience at <a href="https://chat.google.com/room/AAAApUWUZYw">chat.google.com</a></li><li>Download the new mobile app for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.dynamite">Android</a> or <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hangouts-chat/id1163852619?ls%3D1%26mt%3D8">iOS</a></li><li>Download the new standalone desktop app if you&#8217;ve been using the classic Hangouts Chrome extension or app. You&#8217;ll be able to access the desktop app from a prompt that will appear inside <a href="https://chat.google.com/room/AAAApUWUZYw">chat.google.com</a></li><li>On July 20, refresh your Gmail to get the new Chat in Gmail experience.&nbsp;</li><li>Again, please make sure you install the Chat mobile app (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.dynamite">Android</a> or <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hangouts-chat/id1163852619?ls%3D1%26mt%3D8">iOS</a>) before July 20 to minimize chances of missed messages.</li></ul>



<p>Note: It can take up to 24 hours for the changes to take effect, including turning off classic Hangouts apps and turning on new features.</p>



<p><strong>Where do I find my old chats?</strong></p>



<ul><li>You will be able to continue recent 1:1 direct messages from classic Hangouts in Google Chat, but group messages from classic Hangouts (including their history) will not be migrated to Google Chat.</li><li>All previous chat history from classic Hangouts will be accessible in Gmail.</li><li>The classic Hangouts web interface for chat, <a href="https://hangouts.google.com/">hangouts.google.com</a> will remain available during this transition in case you need more time to access and move certain group conversations. Users cannot chat in classic Hangouts by visiting hangouts.google.com in a mobile browser.&nbsp;</li><li>The <a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/9296561">classic Hangouts bot</a> in Chat will also notify you of missed group messages from classic Hangouts.</li></ul>



<p><strong>What are the limitations of Chat?</strong></p>



<p>Group messages from classic Hangouts (including their history) will not be migrated to Chat. Users can still access these group messages in <a href="https://hangouts.google.com/">hangouts.google.com</a>.<br><br>If you have important group messages in classic Hangouts, we recommend that you recreate them as Rooms in the new Chat.</p>



<p>Group direct messages and rooms that are started in the new Chat will not send messages to users who are still on the classic Hangouts apps.</p>



<p><strong>Where do I go for help?</strong></p>



<ul><li>The Support Desk is ready to answer your questions</li><li>Join the LIVE Meet on July 22 at 3pm &#8211; “Chat for the email fatigued”. <br> <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://calendar.google.com/event?action=TEMPLATE&amp;tmeid=NzZqODdlZGRwZWMyZDJqbWc0b243NzcyYWJfMjAyMDA1MjdUMTkwMDAwWiBtdWhsZW5iZXJnLmVkdV9ubjgzODRpbDYwc2gyOG1ndXRjMDhodHNmb0Bn&amp;tmsrc=muhlenberg.edu_nn8384il60sh28mgutc08htsfo%40group.calendar.google.com&amp;scp=ALL" target="_blank">The Meet link is available in the Google Calendar event</a> </li><li>Want to learn more?

<p>In a time when we are learning, teaching and working remotely, there is an exponential increase in scams and hackers trying to exploit vulnerabilities. </p>



<p><a href="https://video.muhlenberg.edu/media/Zoom+Security+Discussion-+April+2020/0_eao8vpyl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Check out this short video with information on how to  stay safe while teaching, learning and working remotely.</a></p>







<p>Here are a few tips about how to stay safe online:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Use strong, unique passwords/passphrases for every account.</li><li>Password protect your Zoom meetings to protect against unwanted participants gaining access. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/19gvLggUHvYBjY3zRRdPob9EYGtdxKqTxjtLLpBExpvc/edit?usp=sharing">Check out the Zoom: Security best practices guide to learn more. </a></li><li>Hangouts Meet<ul><li>Note: Only individuals in our domain can enter a Hangouts Meet without being admitted by the host. If you get a message during a meeting that someone wants to join, it is from a non Muhlenberg account. Make sure you know who it is before admitting them.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>Muhlenberg requires 2-factor authentication to access our application portal from off campus. Make sure you enable 2-factor/multi-factor authentication whenever it is offered, protecting your personal and professional accounts.&nbsp;</li><li>Update software, and enable automatic updates where available.</li><li>Think before you click. Phishings scams are not going away. Remain skeptical of all requests for sensitive information and report phishing to Gmail.&nbsp;</li><li>Only connect to secure WiFI networks. If you must connect to open WiFi use VPN before accessing campus systems or sensitive information.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Upcoming security enhancement</strong>:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><strong>Zoom update to macOS</strong><strong><br></strong>Keeping applications up to date is important for many reasons. New features, stable functionality and above all, security.&nbsp; We will be pushing out an install to upgrade all versions of Zoom to the latest stable release on all college owned Apple computers starting at 7:30am, Thursday, April 2.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>If you are unsure of what to do or believe that you have been compromised, contact the Office of Information Technology. We are here to help.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Throughout the month of March, the Instructional Technology and Media Services team is presenting on the topics of the new gradebook in Canvas, and about collaboration tools.</p>



<p>Days of the week and times of day vary. The gradebook session is in Zoom (online), while the collaboration tools session is in person/on-campus. Let’s look at the details on each session:</p>



<p>When it comes to the new gradebook in Canvas, we want all users to feel comfortable with the new look and feel, as well as versed in the new features and the menu locations of commonly used areas within the gradebook. As a result, we have both Zoom and online sessions throughout the semester for you.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>Please join us for the next <strong>Canvas New Gradebook </strong>just in time for mid-semester grading and spring break. The session is scheduled for <strong>Tuesday, March 3rd from 2 to 3 p.m. in Zoom</strong>. Bring questions or items you would like more details regarding and we will explore the gradebook format in a casual, virtual discussion.<br></p>



<p>In our second session related to <strong>collaboration tools</strong> this academic year, we will explore what these tools are, what can they include, and what can they offer you and your students. There will be several options explored and showcased, and lots of tips and user know-how shared. Please join us in Ettinger 103 (LC Commons) for more on <strong>Monday, March 16th from 3:30-4:30 p.m.</strong></p>

<p>Is your New Year’s Resolution to increase your technology use or know-how? Could it be a goal in the coming semester? What about professional development and engagement in these conversations? Participate in a casual yet active peer environment, where we are learning, trying, exploring, refining, and producing meaningful plans and next steps for augmenting our work and our students’ experiences during these January 2020 sessions!<br></p>



<p>The Instructional Technology and Media Services team is presenting on topics related to the learning management system (Canvas), accessibility, web-conferencing via Zoom, and has a workshop (or more) for you! Most workshops are in Zoom, so you can join us from anywhere with an internet connection and device. Days of the week and times of day vary, and some sessions (but not all) repeat at strategic points of the semester (and even between semesters!) to maximize opportunities and in respect for busy schedules and engagement in teaching, research, mentoring, etc.<br></p>



<p>In this new year and academic semester lead-in, we set a goal to provide more details regarding each of our workshops to make the professional development decision making a bit easier for all of you, because titles cannot fully encapsulate, and because well, now, our workshops are up against the entertaining Golf Cart Pedagogy in terms of your attention! So, each month, our IT blog will showcase the upcoming slate of workshops in more specificity&#8230;starting here, right now, with January 2020 ITMS workshops:<br></p>



<p>Faculty will share their own Canvas experiences, and how they use various areas of the learning management system. Topics may include external tools, SpeedGrader, assignment due date setter/the calendar, modules, among more! The faculty presenters are across disciplines and using Canvas in very different ways. <strong>Share Your Canvas</strong> can inspire you in the spring, and/or help you as you think about your own plans for Canvas into the future. <strong>Share Your Canvas (Zoom session): Tuesday, January 7th, session starts at 3 p.m.</strong><br></p>



<p>Videos and PDF files are helpful and common file types in many areas of daily life and the Internet, but did you know that more is needed and required for them for accessibility purposes? Whether creating content for a Canvas site, for the web, or working through document remediation, we can provide helpful insights and knowledge. Explore the <strong>video captioning process in Reach and OCR remediation steps and best practices for PDF</strong>s in this session. Learn about the different workflows, and how to even optimize the document and media creation processes to promote inclusive design. <strong>Captioning and OCR (Zoom session): Wednesday, January 8th, session starts at 1 p.m.</strong><br></p>



<p><strong>Accessibility and Universal Design</strong> for Learning are essential parts of our work in higher education and within teaching and learning, but what are some recommended tips and best practices which can promote inclusive strategies and proactive means of creating sustainable materials for our courses? This workshop explores tips and best practices across learning materials, document creations, as well as about the resources both on campus and beyond for a deeper understanding of the benefits of Universal Design for Learning and accessibility conversations within the work we do. <strong>Accessibility and Universal Design for Learning (Zoom session): Thursday, January 9, session starts at 3:30.</strong><br></p>



<p><strong>Canvas gradebook</strong> is changing effective January 2020. We want all users to feel comfortable with the new look and feel, as well as versed in the new features and the menu locations of commonly used areas within the gradebook. As a result, we have both Zoom and online sessions throughout the semester for you. Please join us for <strong>Canvas New Gradebook &#8211; Friday, January 10th starting at 9:30 in Zoom, or Tuesday, January 28th starting at 1 in Ettinger 103.</strong><br></p>



<p>Canvas quizzes are scantron and paper free, as well as features used in many courses. We want to explore the newer option for developing quizzes in Canvas assignments. Join us for this <strong>Quizzes.Next workshop</strong> for a primer on creating dynamic quizzes and activities using the quiz builder, and get started with your Canvas planning. <strong>Quizzes.Next session (in Ettinger 103): Tuesday, January 21st starting at 3 p.m.</strong><br></p>



<p><strong>Zoom </strong>is a timely topic for winter, as previous winterizing your course workshops have shown, as well as has increased use for staffs/departments around campus as well. Explore how to get started in web-conferencing, with Zoom, and do this while being a Zoom participant yourself! <strong>Zoom About Zoom (in Zoom): Monday, January 27th, starting at 3 p.m.</strong><br></p>



<p>Questions regarding any sessions? Want the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h-o5St_ThIafL4A6rLHoWQp8Ow8bYd1w-sd5JE9KISA/edit">Zoom meeting links of interest</a>?
