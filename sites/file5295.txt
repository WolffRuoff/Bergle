								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After today&#8217;s showing for the RAs and SAs, a gentlemen asked us why each of us members of the cast wanted to be a part of SDP and what we hope the incoming freshmen, and anyone else who watches us, learn from the performance.  And here is my response.</p>
<p>When I first saw information about auditions for this year&#8217;s Diversity Project, I wasn&#8217;t completely sure if I wanted to go for it or not.  It wasn&#8217;t until later on that I realized how much I needed to audition and be a part of this process.  Last semester I was taking three classes in which they all discussed racial issues in education and the dance community.  These conversations mainly focused on racial issues between black and white.  As a half white, half Asian woman I became so frustrated by this.  In all my educational years, there is so little mentioned about Asian Americans in a historical and current context, so why should I be so shocked that this was still the case in college.  I realized in that moment that by not at least auditioning for SDP I was risking the possibility of an Asian American&#8217;s voice not being heard.  I became sick and tired of being left out, of being cast aside as not important, not a concern when that is the precise reason why it IS a concern.  By being part of this process I can assure that the issues faced by Asian Americans on campus are brought to light and included.  Now that we&#8217;re at the very end of this project, I can gladly say that I think I did my part and I&#8217;m very happy that this particular concern was addressed.</p>
<p>As for what I hope students, faculty, administration, etc. learn from this year&#8217;s performance.  Well I hope they understand that there is, in fact, a problem concerning diversity on our campus and that they see it as more than just a passing sentiment.  I want them to care and be concerned with the issue just as much as I am.  I don&#8217;t want people to be afraid to feel uncomfortable but understand that feeling uncomfortable is okay.  These discussions are hard especially the realizations and truths that come to light as a part of it.  But I think there is a brighter light at the end of the tunnel and what I hope is that people understand how much of a disservice is being done to the Muhlenberg Community by lacking diversity and lacking these sorts of discussions.  I want people to care; I want people to want to care.  I also want our audiences to realize that their general conceptions and supposed knowledge of the issues and concerns are not enough.  Things need to change on this campus, and yes the state of America in relation to this isn&#8217;t perfect either, but I think Muhlenberg may just be a bit behind as well.  It&#8217;s time for Muhlenberg to &#8220;wake up&#8221;.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I first came to Muhlenberg as a freshman I was hesitant about the college for a lot of reasons. Luckily, orientation demonstrated that I had come to a really great place. Especially seeing the Sedehi Diversity Project for the first time.</p>
<p>Myself, along with one hundred or so freshmen filed into the performance space in our orientation groups, and I was completely unsure of what to expect. Orientation puts you through the wringer &#8211; you&#8217;re busy constantly and completely over stimulated by all the new people you&#8217;re meeting and new experiences you&#8217;re having. That coupled by the hurricane and everyone was a little frazzled. Once we were all seated, the director of the project stood up and introduced the play &#8211; I don&#8217;t even remember what she said &#8211; and then it began.</p>
<p>Students just started talking. And saying things I&#8217;d never heard anyone say before.</p>
<p>The diversity project talks about a lot of topics. Generally, we cover discussions of race, class, gender, sexual orientation, religion, ability (in terms of physical disabilities, learning disabilities, and mental health), body image, and Muhlenberg’s relationship to Allentown.</p>
<p>I honestly did not know people were allowed to talk about these issues. I’d been taught all my life that it was rude to talk about race or class or religion or ability, and why bother talking about sexual orientation or gender – non-normativity in these areas doesn’t exist. And suddenly my peers were all around me being blatantly honest about how they felt.</p>
<p>I realized I fit somewhere. That things I’d been experiencing in my life were real. And that conversations about diversity aren’t rude, they are 100% necessary. All of the time. For every.</p>
<p>I cried during my first viewing of the Sedehi Diversity Project. Four separate times. I’d never thought about ways in which core aspects of my identity had an impact on positive and negative experiences of life. I’d always thought it was just my life and those experiences happened detached from any sense of identity. Just to me. But as it turns out, those positive and negative life experiences are attached to aspects of identity that inform how you interact with everything and everyone!</p>
<p>After the Diversity Project, orientation groups have lengthy discussions about what they’ve seen and their feelings regarding diversity. My orientation group, together, grappled with the loss of the naïve perspective our high schools had taught us. We were shocked by the play and shocked by each other. That day 4 of us came out to each other (be it in official discussion or in conversation amongst ourselves). I’d never come out to any one before and here I was coming out to whole groups of people! Because SDP told me I could!</p>
<p>I think the Sedehi Diversity Project, more than anything else, connects people. It facilitates conversations with people who are different. It facilitates conversation with people who are the same (but didn’t know they were the same at all).  And it starts the most important conversation – a conversation about power and access and how we all interact with each other and the world</p>
