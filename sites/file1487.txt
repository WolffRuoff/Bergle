								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ORACLE IS NO LONGER A CANDIDATE</p>
<p>The first meeting between Steering and Selection was indeed productive.  As part of the process, the Steering and Selection Committees voted to remove Oracle as a vendor choice.  It was the committees&#8217; opinion that Oracle, despite it&#8217;s maturity as a company, does not have a mature product in the liberal arts college space.</p>
<p>Please disregard any communications you may have seen in the past about Oracle for the ERP Selection Process.  If you see something that references Oracle, feel free to contact me, John Glasgow.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As we are preparing for the on campus demonstrations of the various systems, I would like to take a moment to go over with you the steps we are going to take in the coming weeks. There are two important tasks being done at the same time leading up to the demos; interviewing various institutions who are using these products, and preparing for the demos. In this correspondence, we will be addressing the vendor demonstrations.</p>
<p>Currently, we are in the phase of creating the itineraries for the vendors. We are compiling lists of items the groups would like to see from the vendors. We will be looking to using these demos as an opportunity to investigate these products further.</p>
<p>Getting the demo themes to the vendors in December will allow them to allocate experts from their business to come to the college for the live demos as well as allow us to schedule the demos for the February/March timeframe.</p>
<p>We will be working toward solidifying dates with the vendors. Some of the durations of the presentations will be shorter, others longer, based on the strengths and weaknesses of each vendor. Some, as an example, might not have an Advancement module, so some accommodation will have to be taken into account for this.</p>
<p>Once the demos have started, in February/March, everyone is invited to attend the sessions. At the sessions, there will be paper surveys to fill out to give us an idea of your thoughts on the product for that session. These paper surveys are also going to have a link to the ERP website as well as to an online survey (if you would rather complete the survey electronically).</p>
<p>The information gathered from the surveys will be presented to the Steering Committee. At that point we will reduce the number of vendors that we wish to pursue further. This will save us time that we can then use to delve into the intricacies of the remaining products. The information that is gained from these further reviews can be used to further craft the requirements for the Request for Information (RFI).</p>
<p>As we head into March, a copy of the RFI will be sent to each of the remaining vendors. It will give us more detailed information as to what the capabilities and limitations are. The response will also include if there are add-ins we would need to purchase from the vendor or a 3rd party. This portion of the process will take roughly 2 months for the responses to get back to us.</p>
<p>In May, we will start to get the responses to the RFI. These responses will be looked at thoroughly by the Selection Committee. We will compile a list of questions for each department based on the information from the RFI. This will be used to find any &#8220;deal breakers&#8221;. Based on a scoring system, the Selection Committee will propose a vendor/product to Steering Committee to ratify. Based on that ratification, it will get final approval from the Executive Committee. This process should be done by July, 2016.</p>
