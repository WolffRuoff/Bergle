								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Writing is a huge part of society today making it an important skill people should be able to master. Hanski emphasizes on the importance of reading and how it directly affects a person’s ability to write. Writing is a skill that is not picked up easily, a lot of time and effort has to be put into it to become a thoughtful writer. Hanski mentions many different positive results by reading more but there was one result that he emphasized repeatedly, “Writing is a skill…It provides you with wider vocabulary for your own works” (Hanski, 2014 p.1). By reading more you are exposing yourself to vast quantities of different vocabulary that you might not have heard of before. This allows you to look up and learn new words and then apply them to different situations overall improving your ability to write.</p>
<p>Throughout the article Hanski uses various positive words such as “cool”, “cozy”, and “fashionable” (Hanski 2014) in order to grab the reader’s attention and put a positive light on reading. As you expand your vocabulary dictionary you are exposed to different ways to express things. Even though the vocabulary in Hanskis’ article is simple, without knowing those specific simple words he would not have been able to put reading into such a positive light.</p>
<p>Straying away from Hanskis’ multiple use of positive words he also repeatedly uses vocabulary that emphasize on growth, “Reading widens and vocabulary, broadens a kid’s mind, helps him understand the world better” (Hanski, 2014 p.2). I think Hanski highlights growth by using the terms “widens” and “broaden” which both show the reader that by reading your writing skill can easily improve. I felt that this was an effective way to grab the reader’s attention because like me, some people don’t get the same rush of enjoyment from reading/writing as others but when I was done with Hanskis’ article I felt motivated to read more than I have in the past.</p>
