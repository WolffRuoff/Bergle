					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I completely agree. When I took a marketing class two summers ago, the focus was on social media. We created campaigns and rebranded companies&#039; images online because that is where you can find the biggest audience. It is also much more efficient to make a campaign online than to make something to go on a billboard. Making a campaign or advertisement online allows the company to constantly update the information and interact with customers.&lt;/p&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Chris, this was a really interesting read. I never really thought that businesses used social media for damage control but I think it is so interesting that businesses can get the word out by using social media. It really seems like something very important to businesses success.&lt;/p&gt;
