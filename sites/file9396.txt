		<p><em><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/?p=594">Yesterday</a>, we brought you five profiles of Muhlenberg senior football players. Here are five more.</em></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/12/musickmhs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-603" title="Matt Musick" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/12/musickmhs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Matt Musick </strong></p>
<p><strong>What has been the key to your special teams success?</strong> Be prideful. There’s this stigma about playing special teams that somehow it’s not of equal importance to starting on defense or offense, but our coaching staff preaches the opposite. And truthfully, most close games come down to a big special teams play or field position through special teams. I love playing outside linebacker, but there is still no adrenaline rush like running down on the opening kickoff.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What was it like studying abroad in Australia this past spring? </strong>Australia is a magnificent country, and I saw places and did things that are hard to believe and even harder to describe. By far the best decision I have made in my life, going to Australia changed my perspective on a lot of things, and I can’t wait to continue traveling and seeing different parts of the world. Once my bank account recovers from last semester, that is.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What it’s like having a twin, especially one who is on the same team? </strong>I always get asked this question and don’t know how to respond because I don’t know what it’s like to not have a twin. Anyone who knows the two of us can see that we’re very different people. Physically, Phil’s got maybe half an inch on me and about 200 pounds. Characteristically, he’s a numbers geek; I’m a writer. He’s in bed early; I’m out late. Being on the same team isn’t much different than growing up with him. We compete against each other on the practice field every day, and Coach Hannis tries to make an event of us going against each other in one-on-one drills. He calls it, “The Battle for the Last Pork Chop.” It’s a good time until Phil gets angry and starts cutting at the knees, but that’s another story. <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans? </strong>Just enjoy the ride.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What kind of teammate is Mike Fiorillo? </strong>“Fi” is the best. He’s not only a teammate, but one of my best friends. We’ve spent a lot of time together on and off the field. He works hard and makes sure he is as prepared as possible when game time rolls around. We’ve bonded a lot, mainly through our position as the vertically challenged linebackers. A man with great affinity for wisdom and words, he started what became known as the “Fi”ctionary; a group of words or phrases he has somehow produced that don’t necessarily exist. These words are often best stated with extreme movement of the hands.</p>

<p><strong>How have you improved since your freshman year? </strong>Since my freshman year, I’ve improved a lot. It took me about a year and a half to really understand the defense, and when I finally did I became a much better player. It also helped that I shed about 20 pounds and got in much better shape.</p>
<p><strong>What do you feel is the strongest part of your game? </strong>I’m pretty small for an inside linebacker, so I would say that being quick is a good attribute, along with being a solid pass defender.</p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans? </strong>I’ve worked for Aramark in the summer for about six years and really have enjoyed it. I would love to get a [full-time] job with Aramark. But if all else fails, I’ll go to Vegas and try to make it big.</p>
<p><strong>What kind of person is Mark Mounayar? </strong>Mark and I have been pretty good friends since freshman year, and I’ve never had anything bad to say about him. He came in playing offensive line; it didn’t work out for him over there, and he got moved to nose guard. But instead of complaining, he just keeps beating up the opposing center every week and making our team better.</p>

<p><strong>What’s the most lasting memory from your football career? </strong>It was really special to be a starter on a championship team last year. My most lasting memory was probably the Ursinus game at home because the championship was on the line, and we got the job done.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>You’ve played on both the offensive and defensive lines; which do you prefer and why? </strong>I truly miss playing offensive line, but I definitely prefer playing defense. Playing offensive line was a bit more complicated than playing defensive line. I’m glad the coaches left me on the PAT team so I still get to line up with the O-line sometimes.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>How did you choose mathematics as your major? </strong>I know it sounds weird to most people, but math has been my favorite subject in school for as far back as I can remember. I decided to declare as a math major freshman year when I realized that I can’t write papers.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans? </strong>To graduate and find a job.</p>
<p><strong>What’s Matt Musick like off the field? </strong>On the field in games, at practice or even in intramural basketball, you know Musick is going to raise the intensity and get people fired up. Off the field, though, Matt is much calmer, down-to-earth and easy-going. Matt has been a great friend for four years and will continue to be for many more.</p>

<p><strong>What have been the keys to your success both last season and this year? </strong>The keys to my success have always been hard work and determination, but I owe most of my success to my teammates and coaches.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s your favorite move to put on an offensive lineman? </strong>My favorite move on an offensive lineman would be the bull rush. The feeling of running over someone is a little more thrilling than running around.</p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans? </strong>My plans were to finish up my remaining credits, take the CPA exam and hit the work force next year. But with a possible extra year of eligibility, I have to make a decision.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What has it been like getting to play for four more years with your high school teammate Victor Taiwo? </strong>It’s been great. To be able to grow as a player, and even more as person, with my best friend has been great.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/12/taiwohs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-607" title="Victor Taiwo" src="http://sportsinfo.blogs.muhlenberg.edu/files/2011/12/taiwohs.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Victor Taiwo</strong></p>
<p><strong>How have you improved since your freshman year? </strong>Freshman year I was “all brawn, no brain.” I had no clue what I was doing and was lost most of the time. Sophomore year, I got about two of the hundred-plus plays down. I found myself asking freshmen what to do, which was a warning sign that my days as a linebacker were coming to an end. The coaches felt that it would be best to move me the defensive line. My junior year was a transitional year, and I started becoming a student of the game. All the pieces are finally coming together. I guess it’s better late than never.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s your most memorable off-the-field moment or accomplishment from your time at Muhlenberg? </strong>This past summer, I got the chance to attend a national conference of race and ethnicity in San Francisco with the Muhlenberg College Office of Multicultural Life. I had the privilege to meet many people from various backgrounds and talk to them about their point of view on current issues of race, gender and identity. It was an experience that really helped me grow as a person and improved my knowledge about different life styles.</p>
<p><strong>What are your future plans?</strong> I am currently pursuing a job in pharmaceutical sales. Kenny [Cobb] and I have also thought about coaching a high school football team after we make our riches. I would be the offensive coordinator and head coach, while he would coach the defense and special teams.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What has it been like getting to play for four more years with your high school teammate Kenneth Cobb?</strong> Playing with Cobb has been something special, even though he would never admit that he came to Muhlenberg because he could not imagine a life without me. Having that brother that you know to push you and bring out the best in you is something that I could never have dreamed of, and Kenny does just that. Although our eight years of playing football together are coming to an end, I am sure we will still find something to compete against each other with.</p>
