								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of Apple&#8217;s newest products, the Apple Watch, made its debut in the Spring of 2015. It is an incredible device, and it&#8217;s popularity has exploded because people love the thought of technology right at their fingertips.The watch &#8220;quickly became the best-selling wearable device with the shipment of 4.2 million smartwatches in the second quarter of 2015&#8221; (&#8220;Apple Watch,&#8221; 2015). Apple watch allows you to view text messages and e-mails right on your wrist, while allowing you to keep your iPhone in your pocket (&#8220;Apple Watch,&#8221; 2015). People like this because it comes off as more professional. For example, if an attendee is in the middle of a meeting, it typically isn&#8217;t appropriate for him or her to pull out a phone. However, if the attendee is just looking at their watch, chances are no one can tell the difference. Additionally, users can hold phone conversations and speak right into the watch to reply to messages. This is helpful because people like to be able to manage their time as efficiently as possible. Since the apple watch gives people such easy access to technology, it&#8217;s popularity is going to continue to reflect that.</p>
<p>Through the Fitness app on the watch, people can track their physical activity and send data back to their phone to keep for future records (&#8220;Apple Watch,&#8221; 2015).This feature of the watch is just another of many reasons that people are so drawn to this technology. People no longer have to carry additional equipment with them, aside from their phone and watch, to track their physical activity throughout their day. This is also a huge convenience piece, and people are majorly in favor of it. Interestingly enough even with this convenience factor in mind that draw people to purchase the watch, there have been some negative reviews. &#8220;Many reviewers described the watch as functional and convenient, while also noting failure to offer as much potential functionality as preceding smartphones&#8221; (&#8220;Apple Watch,&#8221; 2015). However, even with mixed reviews, people are still going to be interested in purchasing the watch to explore it for themselves, and still consider it a convenient tool that they can have easy access to.</p>
<p>The Apple Watch comes in different collections, sizes, and colors, providing buyers with lots of choice (&#8220;Apple Watch,&#8221; 2015). Today&#8217;s generation goes crazy at the thought of a thinner, sleeker, piece of technology because of it&#8217;s convenience factor. Apple Watch, along with many other new technologies have proven that people are willing to pay a hefty price just so that they can have the latest and greatest. People want to be able to access technology while putting forth the least amount of effort possible.</p>
<p>In conclusion, Apple Watch is a great example of a new technology that has attracted the attention of millions simply because of its look, its usefulness, and its incredibly small size. Apple watch does it all, and it is going to continue to be a huge success as more versions come out in the future.</p>
